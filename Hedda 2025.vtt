Once, you told me that
you would burn it all off.

She's different now.
She's softer, more careful.

-When I left.

If I can't even entertain as I expected...

38:42.666 --> 38:46.041
I wonder whether I couldn't get Tesman
interested in a political career.

38:46.125 --> 38:47.541
[scoffs] No, my dear.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.541
Political life is not for him.

38:49.625 --> 38:51.041
He is aggressively unsuited to it.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.833
Perhaps, but couldn't I ease him
in that direction, make him take it up?

38:54.916 --> 38:57.833
-Why put him in a position to fail?
-I've told you.

38:59.708 --> 39:03.833

him to become, say, a cabinet minister?

58:09.541 --> 58:11.625
Just want to look at you.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.500
[sighs]

58:26.875 --> 58:27.875
Eileen.

58:27.958 --> 58:30.458
Why did you make me drink, Hedda?

58:32.708 --> 58:34.416
I wanted to talk to you.

58:34.500 --> 58:36.416
Why didn't you just?

58:36.500 --> 58:37.750
You weren't being yourself.

58:37.833 --> 58:39.333
I've changed. That's all.

58:39.416 --> 58:41.166
[scoffs] People don't change.

58:41.250 --> 58:42.625
Apparently.

58:45.375 --> 58:47.250
Do you think that you...

58:49.333 --> 58:52.625
...you and I, if I'd said yes--

58:52.708 --> 58:54.500
You never would have.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.583
A coward at heart.

58:58.833 --> 59:00.291
Yes.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.333
But do you think that--

59:03.416 --> 59:07.375
I've tried not to think about you, Hedda.

59:07.458 --> 59:09.541
If I could have,

59:09.625 --> 59:11.750
things would have been different?

59:11.833 --> 59:14.666
I would've, could've been
your partner in all of this.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.458
-No.
-Could've done what you said.

59:17.291 --> 59:20.916
Build something with you, could've been--

59:21.000 --> 59:22.458
Happy.

59:26.416 --> 59:27.750
Yes.

59:31.583 --> 59:35.291
I used to think I could never be happy.

59:35.375 --> 59:37.291
I thought...

59:39.458 --> 59:41.916
...being miserable was what I deserved.

59:44.041 --> 59:48.458
What I was owed for a vile life.

59:49.583 --> 59:51.041
[chuckles softly]

59:54.125 --> 59:57.708
[chuckles] I've since learned
that I'm not that way at all.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.125
But you, you can never be happy.

01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:05.750
I think you were right about that.

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.166
I can.

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:11.166
But not like this.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.583
-Not like this.
-You have everything.

01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:14.666
I have nothing.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:19.500
You feel nothing.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.916
I love you.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.458
[somber music playing]

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.083
We were mad together.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.208
I would have been dead,
by your hand or mine, if I'd stayed.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.208
Why did you come here?

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:45.875
To make sure I didn't love you.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:52.166
And?

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:57.500
I don't.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.875
Thea left her life for me.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.208
She made me better.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:13.833
She showed me how to be brave.

01:01:13.916 --> 01:01:15.833
I love her.

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:21.625
I had to make sure
I had all of myself to give.

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.166
You have it all worked out, then.

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.333
-Don't be cross.
-I'm not.

01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:34.833
You should go to her.

01:01:34.916 --> 01:01:36.333
But...

01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:38.375
Your buts have sharp edges.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:41.625
But first, finish what you started.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.375
-[groans]
-Go into the library.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.083
-Talk to your colleagues.
-No.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.583
You've played with the girls.
Now go and be with the boys.

01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:49.125
I'm too drunk.

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:51.125
You're fine.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.250
Come. Come here.

01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:06.500
All right.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.750
[quiet, tense music playing]

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:18.875
[grunts softly]

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:23.875
Perfect.

01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:25.375
Go.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.250
You're really not upset?

01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:53.833
[Eileen sighs]

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.791
[chuckles softly]

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.333
-Eileen.
-Shh.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:44.291
Anybody want anything?

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:47.375
I'll have an old-fashioned.

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.833
[man] Same for me.

01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:51.125
Three gin martinis. Got it.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.958
[laughter]

01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:03.666
[drink pouring]

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.541
What's with that girl?

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:06.708
What girl?

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:08.416
Thea.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:11.541
We worked on the book together.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.125
Is that all?

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.083
No.

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.541
Is she your muse?

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.750
"Muse." [scoffs]

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:26.333
-"Muse" is a man's word.

and don't wish to credit
but absolutely want to fuck.

[laughter]

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.416
Or, I suppose, are fucking.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.625
[chuckles]

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.000
Is that in the dictionary?

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.208
Merriam-Webster's.

01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:41.708
-[man] Is it in your book?
-[man 2] What else is in your book?

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.583
How did you come up with it?

01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:45.041
-Hmm?
-[Eileen] Well...

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:49.583
I knew I had to write this book

01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:54.458
after a quite elucidating conversation
with a young man at a bar.

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:55.875
I went with a friend of mine.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.458
You might have met her here-- Diana.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:58.916
-Mm.
-And it was late,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
just before closing,
and we thought, "Oh, why not?

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:03.750
Just one more."

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.833
She likes a tableau, a bit of a show,

01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:08.458
-so we go to Cissy's.
-[laughter]

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:10.000
[man] That den of iniquity?

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:12.791
Oh, don't be such prudes.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:15.250
We go in, grab a seat at the bar,

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:18.333
I light a cigarette,
Diana gets her whiskey,

01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:20.791
and we have a nice chat
with the men tending.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.208
And there were two of them.

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:25.666
Tall, good. Weak chins, bad.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.333
But typical of their type.

01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:30.125
And what type is that?

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:33.708
The forgotten bastard children of lords.

01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:36.458
[laughter]

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.708
We have a bit of a flirt.

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:41.166
Obviously with me,
it's not going anywhere,

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.083
and after a while,
they started to bore us,

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:45.250
so we retired to a table.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:46.791
Get to the fucking, Eileen.

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.458
[laughter, murmurs of agreement]

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:49.958
[Eileen] So, then...

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:54.208
...we are sitting there...

01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:59.583
...Diana is complaining
about her dull husband Richard,

01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:01.458
who is dull and vile,

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.666
and I'm listening
as much as one who's already decided

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.791
not to waste one's days
trying to please a man can.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:15.166
And then my weak-chinned bartender
comes over,

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.541
slides into the booth next to me,
and he says,

01:06:18.625 --> 01:06:20.125
"Hello.

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:22.208
I think you're beautiful.

01:06:22.291 --> 01:06:23.916
Can I smell your feet?"

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.333
[light laughter, murmuring]

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.083
[Brack] What did you say?

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:30.458
[Eileen] I said, "Whatever for?"

01:06:30.541 --> 01:06:31.875
[Brack] Uh-huh.

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:33.958
[Eileen] And then he says,

01:06:34.041 --> 01:06:36.083
"It's my thing. I like it.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.875
Don't be shy."

01:06:37.958 --> 01:06:40.166
-His thing?
-[Brack] Did you let him?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.583
Of course not, you gang of perverts.

01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:49.333
[laughter]

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:51.916
I told him I preferred
my sexual encounters

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.875
to be mutual and in private.

01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:55.166
[light laughter, murmuring]

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.916
That was sexual?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.583
[Eileen] That's what I realized.

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:03.041
Maybe all people have a thing
that they like,

01:07:03.125 --> 01:07:07.166
that is different, that is new, maybe.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:12.083
And as some past hidden things
have become normalized,

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:15.708
I wonder, why shouldn't
hidden things in the now

01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:18.375
become normal in the future?

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:21.666
So we'll all be smelling feet
and having a toss in ten years' time.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.208
[laughter]

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:27.041
[Eileen] Who knows what
you get up to, Judge Brack?

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.791
I'm sure it's going to be
far more scandalous.

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:32.083
[chuckling]

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:34.000
[man] So, what are
some of these new things?

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.041
[Eileen] You'll have to buy the book.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:39.791
Or come to one of my lectures
at the university.

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:47.166
I promise I'll give all of your wives
a copy of the book for free.

like a handmaid.

-Oh, don't do that.

Worrying will make you ugly.

I won't leave without her.

to put down her glass.

For a moment.

01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:40.583
Have they asked you about the gun?

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:43.125
What gun?

01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:44.750
The one at the center of all this.

01:38:44.833 --> 01:38:47.458
The one that Eileen shot herself with.

01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:53.041
It's nowhere to be found, apparently.

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:56.500
Professor Greenwood thinks it's his
'cause he lost track of it last night.

01:38:56.583 --> 01:38:58.416
I'm sure they'll want
to speak to him soon.

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:00.666
They'll want to see you next.

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.041
Ah. And what will I say?

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:05.666
Roland, don't tease me.

01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.958
Two guns were fired last night.

01:39:09.333 --> 01:39:12.041
One was Professor Greenwood's,

01:39:12.125 --> 01:39:13.791
and the other is yours.

01:39:16.458 --> 01:39:17.875
Is that what you'll say?

01:39:17.958 --> 01:39:21.041
I'll say I have the gun
that shot Eileen Lovborg.

01:39:21.125 --> 01:39:22.708
-Have you?
-Yes.

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.291
And whose is it?

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:25.458
I think you know.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.958
But what will you say?

01:39:29.041 --> 01:39:31.166
Well...

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.833
that depends.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.583
On my whimsicality.

01:39:39.125 --> 01:39:41.000
It was a good idea, Hedda.

01:39:42.041 --> 01:39:44.166
Sloppily executed, but...

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:52.125
I never thought she'd do it here.

01:39:54.083 --> 01:39:56.958

01:40:16.333 --> 01:40:21.458
when they find out the gun belonged
to the great General Gabler.

01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:23.833
That his pretty little bastard
gave it to a lesbian

01:40:23.916 --> 01:40:26.833

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.833

The thought hadn't crossed my mind.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.541
Fortunately, there's no danger of that.
