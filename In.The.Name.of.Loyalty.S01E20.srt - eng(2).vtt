00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.000
My lord,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.839
all generals have deployed their troops

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.719
to search the city.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.920
I believe Shi Nan
will be apprehended shortly.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.840
They're already like
fish in a barrel to me.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.719
What a pity.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.679
I couldn't
kill Shi Nan myself yesterday.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.679
It seems that shoot from years ago

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.719
didn't teach him a lesson.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.199
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.800
The Wardrobe Bureau just
sent over a new garment.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.639
They request your inspection.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.159
Is this the time

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.400
to try new garments?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.039
Your Majesty, don't get angry.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.599
But the eunuch who delivered the garment

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.680
looked unfamiliar.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.960
He left a cryptic message.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.800
This is what His Majesty needs most.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.520
Open it to understand.

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:13.440
(Get antidote at Eternal Light Temple)

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.439
Your Majesty.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.639
It's me.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.599
You sent the garment?

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.639
Cheng Ge is in danger now.
Give me the antidote.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.840
I told you to come.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.800
You'll get it naturally.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.520
Wanted posters of you
can be seen everywhere.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.039
It's relatively safe here.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.400
Remember this.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.080
Don't wander about.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.919
I'll regularly send people
to provide food to you.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.599
Don't think I'll forgive you for this.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.280
Nan.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.000
I know

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.400
you care for the realm.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.599
All these years,

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.800
I've failed you deeply.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.199
Too many died unjustly because of me.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.360
But this was never my intention.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.800
After all that's happened,

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.360
I can't bear losing anyone else.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.399
Hurry. Don't delay.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.839
Nan.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.040
Thank you.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.120
Give Cheng Ge this message.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.519
I've wronged her all these years.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.839
I was wrong.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.519
What does it say?

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:05.088
(Notice)

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.079
Cheng Ge.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.720
Cheng Ge.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.000
Cheng Ge.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.839
C-Cheng Ge.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.120
Your Grace,

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.199
the Prince Regent is here.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.879
Zhiying,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.120
the envoys heard you favor kites.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.439
So they brought a lot,

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.079
all in styles you'd appreciate.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.240
Take a look.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:28.839
My lord,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.720
I've ordered a citywide hunt
for Shi Nan.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.439
He remains at large.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:56.480
Zhiying,

00:07:58.439 --> 00:07:59.639
I'll leave these here.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.879
I'm truly full.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.919
Eat more

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:45.919
and recover faster.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:56.879
By the way,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.799
where did you

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.320
get the antidote?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.600
Of course, it's from Shi Nan.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:06.879
He also entrusted me with words for you.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:07.960
What words?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.200
He said

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.600
he's wronged you all these years

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.720
and he was wrong.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.200
It seems

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.639
you still can't forgive him.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:31.080
Forgive him?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.440
Must I forgive him?

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.679
I once thought

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.600
he was the only one

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.879
I could trust in this world.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:42.919
But I never thought

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.000
in his eyes,

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.039
I was just a blade,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.879
a pawn,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.679
and a sacrifice.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.279
My pain he caused

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:53.840
was a calculated

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.240
and deliberate choice.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:57.519
He never treated me with sincerity.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.039
Then

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.320
why did you take that stab for him?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.000
Because...

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.200
Because he is important to you.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.799
I don't want you to lose anyone else.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.639
From this moment onward,

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.200
you are the most important person to me.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.919
What do you think?

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.159
Does it look good?

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:54.600
This is...

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.480
This symbolizes that we must

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.399
work in unison

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:01.720
and fight as one.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.879
Come on. Let me put it on for you.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:12.559
Tell me

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.480
if this counts as our love token.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:18.039
Is that all you've got to offer me?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.519
Then it doesn't count.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.840
Childish.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:27.279
Let's go.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.639
Where to?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.080
To the palace.

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.559
Taking him to the palace?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.759
Right now,

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:35.559
Gao Ji thinks my brother

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:37.159
hates my guts.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.639
He'd never believe I'd

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.720
bring him to the palace.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.200
That's called hiding in plain sight.
