-[sighs]

00:44.708 --> 00:46.333
There we go!

00:47.333 --> 00:48.625
There she is!

00:52.416 --> 00:54.750
Rise and shine, She-Rat.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.375
Welcome back to the world of the living.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.916
We can't stay too long.

01:01.041 --> 01:04.958
The Baron is expecting your friends
by the end of the week.

01:05.458 --> 01:08.458
I would hate for them to spoil.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.541
[Ciri] I had thought that a large force,
armed to the teeth,

01:11.625 --> 01:13.166
was waiting for the Rats.

01:13.666 --> 01:16.291
I had tried to get to Jealousy
and warn them.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.541
In my wildest dreams,
it never occurred to me

01:20.041 --> 01:22.750
that the trap was a single man.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.708
[Leo] Aye.

01:23.791 --> 01:25.750
Isn't that your girlfriend?

01:26.250 --> 01:28.333
Mmm? Mistle!

01:28.416 --> 01:30.083
Aye. [chuckles]

01:30.166 --> 01:32.041
That was it. [laughs]

01:32.125 --> 01:36.125
Who the fuck names their child
after a parasite?

01:36.208 --> 01:38.875
A plant that lives off its host,

01:39.458 --> 01:41.458
sucks the life out of it…

01:41.541 --> 01:44.833
[Ciri] Nor did I have any idea
what kind of man he was.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.208
[Leo] Although…

01:49.250 --> 01:53.250
it was you she ate up,
top to toe, wasn't it?

01:54.208 --> 01:58.875
That's why you came flyin'
into that square to save the day.

01:58.958 --> 02:02.000
'Cause you got sucked in…

02:02.083 --> 02:03.333
[hisses]

02:04.333 --> 02:05.666
…to her family.

02:06.875 --> 02:07.916
Mmm?

02:08.833 --> 02:10.041
[chuckles]

02:11.791 --> 02:15.833
That was their fatal flaw,
the lot of them.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.708
You know why?

02:18.333 --> 02:21.166
'Cause you can't be a family
without loyalty.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.666
And loyalty…

02:23.416 --> 02:26.458
ooh, loyalty rots the brain.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.416
Makes you weak.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.625
Gets you caught.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.708
Or worse. [chuckles]

02:32.791 --> 02:35.541
[Ciri] Whatever happened next
wouldn't touch me at all.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.125
Not a bit.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.041
It's not too late for you, though.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.083
Mmm?

02:42.041 --> 02:46.125
You've shed all that stinky dead weight.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.166
And now, you can grow back,

02:49.250 --> 02:52.125
stronger, tougher…

02:52.625 --> 02:54.875
[Ciri] All I had to do was survive.

02:54.958 --> 02:58.041
Just don't make
the same mistakes they did.

02:59.291 --> 03:02.291
'Cause you and me, our story,

03:03.166 --> 03:04.625
it's just beginnin'.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.166
Why are you doing this?

03:10.458 --> 03:11.625
Why?

03:12.625 --> 03:13.750
Well, that's a…

03:16.833 --> 03:18.750

Ah, folks.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.166

03:57.791 --> 04:00.166
Don't lose your chance to pick a winner.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.041
And who do you think it's gonna be?

04:03.125 --> 04:05.500
Will it be the fearsome doppler?

04:05.583 --> 04:06.666
-[jeering]
-Boo!

04:06.750 --> 04:11.208
Or is it gonna be

04:48.625 --> 04:50.958
And wondering if he's got a knife
hidden behind that barrel.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.000
Oh, yeah? How do you figure?

04:53.500 --> 04:56.083
You still don't believe
I can hear your thoughts, hmm?

and the fight is on, people!

05:01.875 --> 05:03.708
It's showtime.

05:03.791 --> 05:07.750
And right now,
it's the battle of the century.

We have the hideous havoc-wreaker,
the doppler.

But is he any match

killed with this thing?

09:28.041 --> 09:29.750
Nah, that shit's from Vicovaro.

09:29.833 --> 09:33.541
-Well, the King of Vicovaro, then.
-Vicovaro had imperators, not kings.

09:33.625 --> 09:37.125
The fuckin' Imperator of fuckin' Vicovaro.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.083
-How many?
-None. That's a ceremonial weapon.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.666
Oi, pipe down. I love this song.

-[humming]
-[Reef] What song? You fuckin' lunatic.

09:44.916 --> 09:48.500
Just 'cause you can't hear the voices
doesn't mean they aren't singing.

[Reef] Lucky guess.

10:01.291 --> 10:02.291
How'd we do?

10:03.041 --> 10:05.625
Well, once we re-up on food and supplies,

10:05.708 --> 10:08.208
we should have enough left
to last a couple of days.

10:08.708 --> 10:09.916
A couple of days?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.750
Is it me, or are your jobs gettin'
more dangerous and less profitable?

10:13.833 --> 10:15.750
[sighs] You've seen
what's goin' on out there.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.083
Nilfgaard's up everyone's arse right now.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.750
I mean, what do you want me to do?

10:19.833 --> 10:22.791
Do you want me to write a letter
and voice our concerns?

10:22.875 --> 10:26.708

harder to steal shit. Please advise."

[Giselher] You're right. The money's shit.

But what's dangerous, Mistle, is you.

of a rip-and-run, again.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
This ghost you keep seein'?

10:39.500 --> 10:41.083
You need to get over it.

10:42.291 --> 10:46.291
You know?
Before you get us caught or… killed.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We can't keep goin' like this
forever, can we?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.458
Yeah, well, Issy can see the future.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.708

11:01.000 --> 11:02.333
Doesn't work like that.

11:03.041 --> 11:05.041
We survive on coin.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.375
It's that simple.
We need a cash guarantee.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.666
Psychic bullshit won't feed us.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.208
[intriguing music playing]

11:15.208 --> 11:16.208
Maybe it could.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.833
[thrilling music playing]

11:38.583 --> 11:40.041
[children laughing]

11:51.041 --> 11:52.083
[Reef] Whoa.

11:55.458 --> 11:56.416
[woman] Welcome.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.541
The spirits told me that you were coming.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.750
Oh, it's you.

12:03.833 --> 12:07.208
[Mistle] Been a minute, ain't it, Orla?
Business looks slow.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.000
People finally figure out
you're a shit psychic?

12:15.375 --> 12:17.625
Where the hell have you two been?

12:17.708 --> 12:18.875
Oh!

12:18.958 --> 12:23.916
Before Emhyr rolled his arse through here
and conscripted them into his damned army,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.333
the kids in town were my little strays.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.208
And these two were the best,
until they traded up for you lot.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.083
I'd send them to go and find birds' nests,
and they'd bring back the eggs.

12:34.708 --> 12:38.666
Turns out, you don't need a third eye
to know who's scamming,

12:39.166 --> 12:40.333
who's skimming.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.000
[whispers] Orla knows all.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.958
-Exactly. We're looking for a job.
-Something with a big score.

12:46.041 --> 12:49.041
-And no trinkets.
-Well, maybe some trinkets.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.375
-Make it good. We'll pay you for it.
-[coins jingle]

12:52.458 --> 12:55.708
Hmm. I'm moving up in the world.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.458
[horse neighs outside]

12:57.541 --> 13:01.541
Well, I heard
of an inheritance down in Tyffi.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.958
[Kayleigh chuckles]

13:03.708 --> 13:05.916
Or there's the bar witch in Glyswen

13:06.000 --> 13:09.125
who runs some really shady deals
with the Nissir gang.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.375
[Iskra laughs]

13:11.708 --> 13:13.000
Not good enough.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.041
[suspenseful music playing]

13:17.083 --> 13:20.083
I don't know. There's one last thing.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.583
It's big, but

13:22.791 --> 13:24.208
it's dangerous.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.083
You ever heard of Dom Houvenaghel?

13:28.750 --> 13:29.833
Who hasn't?

13:29.916 --> 13:32.541
Guy runs the biggest fight ring
this side of the Yaruga.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.041
That's the one.

13:34.541 --> 13:39.625
Rumor is he's branching out,
opening a new arena over in Amarillo.

13:39.708 --> 13:43.958
You can bet that grand opening
will be the bloodiest night yet.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.458
[Giselher] Holy shit.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.625
If it's anything like
the one in Claremont,

13:47.708 --> 13:50.583
then that place will be packed
with warlords, arms dealers,

13:50.666 --> 13:53.166
the wealthiest, most depraved people
in the city.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.375
Oh, you haven't seen depraved.

13:55.458 --> 13:58.625
The guy Houvenaghel has hired
to run this arena,

13:58.708 --> 14:00.791
he's bad news.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.666
He's a mercenary.

14:04.166 --> 14:07.000
Led the massacres
during the Ebbing Rebellion.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.458
Enslaved hundreds. Killed even more.

14:09.541 --> 14:10.791
He used to have a chokehold

14:10.875 --> 14:13.916
on the border brothels
and all the girls to stock them.

14:14.416 --> 14:16.541
Now he's moving up in the world.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.791
Sadistic piece of shit by the name of--

14:18.875 --> 14:20.416
Bert Brigden.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.541
[coins jingle]

14:26.083 --> 14:27.208
Tell us everything you know.

14:29.916 --> 14:32.333
[Giselher] So,
from what your girl Orla said,

14:32.416 --> 14:34.583
we've got three major issues.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.291
Okay, the first, we're on a clock.
The fight's in a fortnight.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.916
The second, it's invite only.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.458
It's at some beach compound
by the old Amarillo port garrison.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.500
-What's that?
-A fortified prison.

14:50.083 --> 14:54.666
What? I've been in enough prisons
to know what the fuck garrison means.

14:54.750 --> 14:59.250
What it means is our options to infiltrate
are limited as shit.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.083
What's the third problem?

15:01.166 --> 15:02.833
[suspenseful music playing]

15:03.541 --> 15:04.708
You.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.833
[Giselher] We aren't stupid, Mistle.

15:09.916 --> 15:11.875
You clearly know Bert Brigden.

15:14.041 --> 15:14.958
So start talking.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.250
I met Bert Brigden two years ago
on the day before my wedding.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.666
[boys laughing]

15:30.958 --> 15:34.333
[Mistle] I was the blushing bride-to-be
of Lord Genzier of Ebbing.

15:34.958 --> 15:37.666
He was leading
the rebellion against Nilfgaard,

15:37.750 --> 15:39.791
and I would rule by his side when we won.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.583
My life was perfect.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.833
My family was proud.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.500
I didn't love him, but it didn't matter.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.250
Because I had her.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.416
Your ghost.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.208
Juniper was her name.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.583
[gasping]

16:02.875 --> 16:04.250
She was a servant.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.000
And my best friend.

16:07.958 --> 16:11.958
I loved her for as long as I can remember,
and we had our own plans for the future.

16:12.041 --> 16:14.958
Does Daddy know
you're fucking your girlfriend

16:15.041 --> 16:16.833
before you marry an old geezer?

16:16.916 --> 16:17.958
[Mistle] Hmm.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.416
Jealous?

16:21.583 --> 16:23.375
-Ouch!
-Yeah.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.000
[Mistle] No biting!

16:30.750 --> 16:32.375
You need to take care of me.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.333
I will take care of you, milady.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.833
I promise.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.083
We'll take care of each other.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.708
[distant shouting]

16:45.791 --> 16:46.750
Always.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.333
I promise.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.208
[Mistle] I thought
I had it all figured out.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.625
-[woman screams]
-[man 1 yells] One last thing!

16:54.708 --> 16:55.958
[Mistle] I was wrong.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.375
We need to go. Now.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.875
-[man 2] Kill the men.
-[man 3] Keep the women.

17:01.791 --> 17:05.208
Emhyr used Brigden to infiltrate towns.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.500
Sniff out rebellion.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.166
And quash them.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.291
[screaming]

17:17.416 --> 17:18.458
[man screams] No!

17:19.208 --> 17:21.333
[woman] No! No!

17:25.291 --> 17:26.750
[man 4] Let's get them out!

17:29.125 --> 17:30.333
-Mercenaries.
-[Juniper gasps]

17:30.916 --> 17:32.916
[Asse] Nilfgaard found out
about our rebels.

17:33.958 --> 17:37.416
[sobs] If… if they get you,
don't… don't fight.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.625
[poignant music playing]

17:39.708 --> 17:41.166
My sister fought, and…

17:44.833 --> 17:45.833
I hid.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.583
[shudders]

17:47.666 --> 17:49.708
-[distant screaming]
-[Asse whimpers]

17:50.416 --> 17:51.875
-[Juniper] Come on, Mistle.
-[sobbing]

17:51.958 --> 17:53.458
[Juniper] Come on! Mistle!

17:53.541 --> 17:56.500
[women screaming]

17:56.583 --> 17:58.125
[screaming fades]

17:59.708 --> 18:02.125
[Mistle] The conspirators had
a price on their heads.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.833
My family was a high-priority target.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.333
We went back to try and save them.

18:07.416 --> 18:09.333
You heard Asse. We need to run.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.625
Not without my family.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.208
Please, don't leave me.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.958
-[woman screaming]
-Please.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.583
[breathing shakily] Please.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.750
Find your parents. I'll get your brothers.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.833
Hold on to it.

18:22.916 --> 18:26.541
Look at me.
If anyone comes for you, kill them.

18:26.625 --> 18:28.500
Father. Mother.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.208
Father, wake--

18:33.250 --> 18:34.083
Juniper.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.166
Lex. Demitri!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.750
[threatening music playing]

18:38.833 --> 18:40.208
[Mistle panting]

18:44.000 --> 18:46.333
If it isn't the bride-to-be.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.583
I've heard of you, petal.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.958
Oh, it's true what they say.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.625
Now,

19:00.125 --> 19:02.916
let's have some fun, shall we?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.083
-[snarl]
-[echoing scream]

19:10.916 --> 19:13.583
Those girls Orla was talking about,

19:14.083 --> 19:17.166
the ones he funneled into his brothels,

19:17.875 --> 19:18.875
we were among them.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.750
-A noble cunt is still a cunt, sweetheart.
-[woman screams]

19:22.333 --> 19:25.166
[Mistle] That night,
my perfect life became a nightmare.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.916
But Juniper fought
every step of the way to protect me.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.541
[Bert] She is a pretty little thing.

19:31.666 --> 19:32.750
-[Juniper shrieks]
-No!

19:32.833 --> 19:34.541
-[Juniper] No!
-[Bert] Feisty, too.

19:34.625 --> 19:35.666
-[Juniper] No!
-[man laughs]

19:35.750 --> 19:38.875
[Mistle] As I watched Brigden beat her
to death, something inside me broke.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.875
-[screams]
-No!

19:40.958 --> 19:42.958
[Juniper] No!

19:43.041 --> 19:45.208
[Juniper screaming]

19:45.291 --> 19:46.958
[Mistle] I see her everywhere now.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.000
[Juniper screaming]

19:49.083 --> 19:50.583
[screams fade]

19:50.666 --> 19:52.666
[poignant music playing]

19:56.250 --> 19:57.958
I don't know how long I was there.

19:58.625 --> 19:59.458
In his cellar.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.250
But I figured out how to pick the lock.

20:03.125 --> 20:07.416
Worked that thing until my fingers bled
and made it to Loredo, half-dead.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.875
Which is what I'd be if Asse
hadn't found me and taken me to Orla's.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.500
[sighs]

20:21.083 --> 20:22.625
I don't know, Mistle.

20:23.916 --> 20:26.333
When a job gets personal,
it gets reckless.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.791
We all agreed when we started this gang

20:28.875 --> 20:32.166
to check our feelings at the door
and keep the past in the past.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.875
You're really telling me
you don't think about them?

20:35.916 --> 20:39.041
The arseholes
that forced you and Reef into the army?

20:39.125 --> 20:43.500
Or your people,
who abandoned you to save their own skin?

20:43.583 --> 20:46.833
Fuckers who tortured me
into selling out my parents,

20:48.250 --> 20:49.708
got 'em hanged for treason.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.583
[Kayleigh sighs]

20:54.375 --> 20:56.375
There's a million guys
like Brigden out there

20:56.458 --> 21:01.208
who use this war to take what they want
and crush anyone who gets in their way.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.458
And guess what?
They're all gonna be at that fight.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.541
So how about we take something
from them for once, huh?

21:08.625 --> 21:11.500
It would feel good. Just this once.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.666
Right, Giz?

21:12.750 --> 21:14.708
[intriguing music playing]

21:19.500 --> 21:20.958
If we're gonna do this,

21:21.458 --> 21:24.166
it has to be enough
to just take his money, Mistle.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.666
Okay? You can't be distracted
by some fantasy of revenge.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.041
We can't afford any mistakes.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.500
No mistakes.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.083
No mistakes.

21:41.750 --> 21:42.875
[Giselher] Okay.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.958
We start with recon.

21:48.666 --> 21:52.500
Here's what we know.
Houvenaghel's arenas all run the same.

21:52.583 --> 21:56.125
Twelve fights.
Six in the first half, six in the second.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.375
Everyone checks weapons at the entrance.

22:00.458 --> 22:03.083
The only people armed are the guards.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.125
And there'll be plenty.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.208
All bets go into the money boxes.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.791
And the money boxes
are emptied into the vault.

22:13.875 --> 22:18.166
Problem is, we don't know how
to access the vault or how it's secured.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.333
We need to figure out their setup,

22:24.208 --> 22:25.750
find a way into the vault,

22:25.833 --> 22:27.625
and plan our exit route.

22:29.375 --> 22:32.000
Once we're done, meet back at the horses.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.333
[Kayleigh grunts]

22:34.166 --> 22:36.541
Ugh. No one said anything about a boat.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.208
Aw, is Kayleigh scared?

22:38.291 --> 22:40.000
-Are you scared?
-I can't swim.

22:40.083 --> 22:41.500
[laughs]

22:41.583 --> 22:42.958
[man 1] Get the bowl up!

22:43.541 --> 22:45.291
[man 2] Get out the way.
Coming forward here.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.166
If they're usin' the well to move
the money, then it's gotta be this way.

22:49.541 --> 22:50.666
[Kayleigh] Hmm.

22:51.416 --> 22:53.333
Looks like an exit route to me.

22:53.416 --> 22:55.208
-What do you think?
-[Reef sighs]

22:55.291 --> 22:56.833
I think my butt cheeks are wet.

22:56.916 --> 22:58.125
[laughs]

22:58.208 --> 22:59.791
[heavy footsteps above]

22:59.875 --> 23:02.166
Oh! Come here. Sh, sh.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.458
-[man 3] Put 'em over there.
-[man 4] Come on, get up. Go on, hurry up.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.916
What are you thinking?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Thinking you need to keep
your ear covered.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.333
No, about the plan.

23:10.416 --> 23:11.750
I have a bad feeling.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.500
Feelings don't dictate. Strategy does.

23:15.291 --> 23:16.750
I think we can pull it off.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.875
[Bert] Fight night is the best time
to showcase our creation.

23:20.583 --> 23:23.416
The Jalowik has to be ready. No excuses.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.750
Having my intestines ripped
from my asshole isn't an excuse.

23:26.833 --> 23:29.083
Stop being such a chickenshit, Til.

23:29.166 --> 23:32.583
[Til] I'm just saying.
Houvenaghel gave us specific instructions.

23:32.666 --> 23:33.833
[Bert] Ah, fuck him.

23:33.916 --> 23:35.666
We'll sell the Jalowik, get our money,

23:35.750 --> 23:38.458
and be long gone
before he even knows what we're up to.

23:38.541 --> 23:41.125
If the boss learns we siphoned off
money for our creation,

23:41.208 --> 23:42.750
who do you think he'll send after us?

23:42.833 --> 23:45.666
You want big reward,
you have to take big risk.

23:45.750 --> 23:50.125
All I know is that Emhyr will pay a mint
to take control of this Continent.

23:50.208 --> 23:53.708
But when his warlords and his emissaries
see what our little creation can do,

23:53.791 --> 23:55.166
that mint will be ours.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.708
Fight night is my chance
to play with the big dogs,

23:57.791 --> 24:01.333
so you make sure
that my monster is ready to fight.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.375
[suspenseful music playing]

24:07.416 --> 24:09.125
[man 5] That's it, come through.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.166
[Mistle] This looks like
the way down to the vault.

24:25.916 --> 24:27.791
It was brave, what you did yesterday.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.458
To tell everyone what happened.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.541
I know you don't wanna talk about it.

24:34.416 --> 24:35.833
That's why it was brave.

24:38.833 --> 24:43.125
We don't live in the past,
but it kind of makes us who we are.

24:47.041 --> 24:47.916
[Mistle] I…

24:49.291 --> 24:52.208
I guess sometimes I forget
I'm not the only one Brigden hurt.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.916
[poignant music playing]

24:57.875 --> 24:58.958
Every day,

24:59.791 --> 25:03.541
I think to myself, uh, I should've
killed him when I had the chance.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.833
Before Dulcie…

25:09.208 --> 25:10.708
You did everything you could.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.083
Which was nothing.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.208
That's what made me who I am.

25:21.750 --> 25:22.791
A coward.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.583
[keys jingling]

25:36.958 --> 25:38.791
[clanking]

25:40.041 --> 25:41.833
[wind gusting]

25:42.583 --> 25:44.583
[gate hinges squeal]

25:45.458 --> 25:46.750
[gate clangs]

25:47.791 --> 25:49.791
[wind hissing eerily]

25:54.166 --> 25:56.125
[soft, echoing moaning]

25:56.208 --> 25:58.333
[low creaking]

25:58.416 --> 26:01.208
-[soft fluttering]
-[Mistle] Look. There's the well.

26:01.916 --> 26:03.541
[Asse] They'll collect the bets up there.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.875
-[breathing echoing]
-[Asse] Lower them here.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.125
It's a vault, all right.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.583
Yeah. Except the lock
on that gate is pitiful.

26:11.666 --> 26:13.916
Yeah, but nobody works in this part.
It's empty.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.458
[echoing hissing]

26:15.541 --> 26:16.708
And really scary.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.083
-[rasping breaths]
-Sh.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.375
[creaking]

26:19.458 --> 26:20.791
[ominous music playing]

26:20.875 --> 26:22.625
[shuddering and chittering]

26:22.708 --> 26:24.500
[growling]

26:24.583 --> 26:25.625
[Mistle] Go on!

26:29.625 --> 26:31.625
[creature snarling softly]

26:33.416 --> 26:35.250
[squeaking and chittering]

26:35.875 --> 26:37.208
[Asse] Mistle, let's go.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.458
[low, creaking groaning]

26:43.083 --> 26:44.750
[crunching]

26:45.666 --> 26:47.375
[wheezing]

26:48.416 --> 26:49.958
[screeching]

26:50.041 --> 26:51.541
-[thud]
-[creature screeches]

26:52.250 --> 26:54.500
-Ow! Mistle!
-Come on, Asse.

26:54.583 --> 26:56.583
-[creature shrieking]
-[Asse yelping]

27:01.125 --> 27:03.416
[Mistle] Help! Come quick!

27:04.916 --> 27:06.500
Come! Hurry up!

27:06.583 --> 27:07.875
[both groan]

27:07.958 --> 27:09.958
[Mistle, panting] Are you okay?

27:11.375 --> 27:13.166
Asse! Oh, Asse.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.916
Go to the horses
and grab my waterskin, quick!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.166
[Giselher] What happened?

27:17.666 --> 27:20.958
There… there was something down there.
A creature attacked us.

27:21.041 --> 27:23.291
Brigden's monster.
Did you know about this?

27:23.375 --> 27:27.583
No! Brigden's a glorified gutter pimp.
He doesn't have access to shit like that.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.416
He's got new ambitions.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.333
-[yells]
-[Iskra] He's got a mage now.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.083
They're pulling one over on Houvenaghel

27:33.166 --> 27:36.041
using the fight to showcase
some thing called a Jalowik.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.833
-A Jalowik?
-[Iskra] Yeah.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.541
They think it will change
the tide of warfare.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.791
-[Reef] Wait. What? How?
-[Asse groaning]

27:43.875 --> 27:46.041
Does it matter? We need to call it off.

27:46.625 --> 27:51.250
I'm telling you. I've seen this.
Asse's injury, a girl with green eyes.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.250
-No money's worth dying for.
-No!

27:53.333 --> 27:56.083
-No! No, he doesn't deserve to win!
-[Asse panting]

27:56.166 --> 27:59.208
This was the deal, Mistle.
It's not about your revenge.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.416
What happened to taking one back
from these arseholes?

28:01.500 --> 28:02.958
Yeah, I meant money.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.833
And there will be money. Lots of it.

28:05.916 --> 28:07.541
Come on, Kayleigh.

28:08.083 --> 28:12.375
Fine. If we could pull this off without
being mauled by a monster or apprised--

28:12.458 --> 28:13.916
Apprehended!

28:14.000 --> 28:15.041
Whatever.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.666
We'd be set for life.

28:16.750 --> 28:19.291
You wanna fucking survive and have a life?

28:19.375 --> 28:20.791
You're not a mage!

28:21.416 --> 28:22.791
You're not a witcher.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.541
We can't do it, guys.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.083
We can't kill a monster.

28:32.291 --> 28:33.958
Unless we had more help.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.583
[goat bleating]

28:39.041 --> 28:43.000
Oh, gods' sakes, friend.
You could wilt a flower.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.208
-When's the last time you bathed?
-[sighs]

28:45.291 --> 28:46.500
[belches]

28:46.583 --> 28:48.458
You wanna take a bath together?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.500
All you gotta do is ask.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.833
There's not enough liquor in the world.

28:52.916 --> 28:55.083
And you should know.
You've bought about half of it.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.375
-That will be 50 orens.
-[sighs]

28:57.458 --> 28:59.291
-Put it on my tab, honey.
-No.

28:59.791 --> 29:01.583
Come on, Sonora.

29:01.666 --> 29:04.333
It's not my fault this time.
The Black Hand got robbed.

29:04.416 --> 29:06.916
Word on the street is
you got your arse handed to you

29:07.000 --> 29:09.125
by some pipsqueak with a cue stick.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.750
-It was a dice rake.
-Mmm.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.208
-And I was holdin' back.
-Well, so am I.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.375
Now, you can keep one bottle of rye

29:15.458 --> 29:18.000
and that meat stick
you already slobbered all over.

29:18.083 --> 29:21.708
And when you've paid me back for that,
you can pay me for the rest.

29:21.791 --> 29:22.791
Hey.

29:22.875 --> 29:25.083
Consider our bath date cancelled.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.541
-No.
-[kicks table]

29:28.958 --> 29:31.166
[birds calling]

29:35.875 --> 29:37.291
[clattering]

29:38.125 --> 29:40.125
[intriguing music playing]

29:43.583 --> 29:45.291
[witcher] You little shits have
a death wish,

29:46.041 --> 29:47.666
and I'm in the mood to grant it.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.125
We've got a job for you.

29:50.208 --> 29:52.583
I already have a job, one I quite enjoyed,

29:52.666 --> 29:55.291
until you lot came along
and blew up my spot.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.375
[both grunt]

29:56.458 --> 29:57.750
Hey, give me that.

29:57.833 --> 30:00.875
I don't know, man. Kind of seemed
like you were half-arsein' it.

30:02.291 --> 30:04.458
Like, I legitimately would've asked
for my money back

30:04.541 --> 30:06.333
if we weren't already stealin' it.

30:06.416 --> 30:08.291
-[yells]
-[all laugh]

30:08.375 --> 30:11.500
[Giselher] All right. Look, arsehole,
we need you to kill a monster.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.458
So let's just skip the theatrics, yeah?

30:13.541 --> 30:15.958
You've gotta show up, sober.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.875
Stay with us. Get dried out. Get it done.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.458
-Those are the demands.
-[witcher laughs]

30:22.291 --> 30:23.333
Here's my demand.

30:23.416 --> 30:25.083
Eat shit! [grunts]

30:29.541 --> 30:30.583
[glass smashes]

30:32.708 --> 30:34.791
-Are you replacing that?
-[Mistle] Look.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.875
We'll give you a thousand orens up front,
and 20 more after the job is done.

30:41.583 --> 30:42.791
I don't work for Rats.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.791
You get to kill a real monster
for real money.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.208
Then you never have to see us again.

30:52.208 --> 30:53.375
Out of curiosity,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.500
what's your target?

30:56.333 --> 30:58.583
Dominik Houvenaghel's new arena.

30:58.666 --> 30:59.541
[chuckles]

31:00.500 --> 31:02.541
You idiots do have a death wish.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.083
Well, good luck. Godspeed.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.083
And give me the fuckin' money you stole.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.541
-What are you lookin' at?
-You're scared.

31:13.625 --> 31:16.166
Of you? Hardly.

31:19.083 --> 31:20.041
Of failing.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.375
I see a girl in pain.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.125
A princess born under a curse.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.625
I know that story.

31:28.708 --> 31:29.583
A striga.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.166
King Foltest hired three witchers.

31:33.750 --> 31:37.666
The first ran off with all his money.
The second was killed by the beast.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.625
The third, Geralt of Rivia, he saved her.

31:41.416 --> 31:44.708
That's not how it went down.
And the White Wolf's a cunt, so--

31:44.791 --> 31:47.166
Someone you cared for died

31:47.916 --> 31:49.625
because of your cowardice.

31:50.541 --> 31:52.750
That's when the whole world
started hating you.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.375
I was a witcher.

31:54.458 --> 31:56.333
The world always hated me.

31:56.958 --> 32:00.166
[sighs] That's the first time
I agreed with them.

32:02.541 --> 32:05.375
We don't hate you.

32:07.416 --> 32:08.291
We need you.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.333
Please.

32:11.541 --> 32:12.958
[inspiring music playing]

32:19.541 --> 32:20.916
[grunts]

32:23.708 --> 32:25.250
[joints cracking]

32:25.333 --> 32:26.916
Fifty thousand orens.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.250
And I want my pick of beds.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.625
This place is a mess now anyway.

32:31.708 --> 32:33.500
-[clattering]
-Because of you.

32:34.083 --> 32:34.958
Shitheads.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.250
-[clattering]
-[witcher groans]

32:42.500 --> 32:43.416
Thank you.

32:43.916 --> 32:46.458
[sighs] He's our best shot
at getting out of this alive.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.458
[groans]

32:51.958 --> 32:54.625
[witcher] Are you just gonna keep
staring at me or what?

32:54.708 --> 32:55.583
Right?

32:58.833 --> 33:01.208
Damn. Where'd you find all this shit?

33:01.708 --> 33:03.333
[Kayleigh] Five-finger discount.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.625
[scoffs] Oh, you still overpaid.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.250
-[Giselher] Listen up.
-[clattering]

33:08.333 --> 33:10.916
We know our route once we're inside.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.541
Now we just need to get in.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.041
-We need to look like we belong there.
-[Kayleigh] Why don't we just sneak in?

33:16.125 --> 33:19.083
-[Giselher] We need freedom to move.
-[Reef] Yeah, unarmed.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.958
How's Gramps gonna
do his job without a sword?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.166
[Giselher] I'm workin' on it.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.416
Kayleigh and Reef,
your way in is with the boxers.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.625
We need someone
to look like a legit fighter.

33:28.458 --> 33:30.916
And every fighter requires two squires,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.375
so… Asse, you're in.

33:33.458 --> 33:35.583
Fuck, yeah. Put me in the fight ring.

33:36.541 --> 33:38.333
Uh… yeah, you're not our fighter.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.625
-Asse is.
-What?

33:41.708 --> 33:43.875
[Reef laughs]

33:43.958 --> 33:45.125
Chill, man.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.000
He's jokin'.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.750
You're joking?

33:51.833 --> 33:55.583
I'm a trained military combat fighter,
and Asse…

33:55.666 --> 33:56.500
Asse…

33:56.583 --> 34:00.166
You stand knee-high to hog nuts, dipshit,
and you probably weigh half as much.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.791
Big-money arenas is all about uniformity.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.708
You'll never make weight
in a sanctioned fight.

34:04.791 --> 34:08.166
[Giselher] Look, Asse is the only one
that's gonna look legit on paper.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.208
Speaking of, you're gonna need papers.

34:12.375 --> 34:13.958
[lively music playing]

34:16.333 --> 34:19.250
-[sighs] What the fuck is this?
-A government uniform.

34:19.333 --> 34:23.000
The decree of athletic commission
I can forge, but the seal has to be legit.

34:23.083 --> 34:26.250
I need you to go to the Amarillo
prefecture and get it stamped.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.708
[Reef] Giz has lost his damn fuckin' mind.

34:28.791 --> 34:32.000
How the hell am I supposed to make him
look like a believable fighter?

34:32.083 --> 34:34.833
It's the same play
we've done a thousand times,

34:34.916 --> 34:36.708
just with a new bonehead prop.

34:36.791 --> 34:39.083
We stoke the crowd, all hell breaks loose,

34:39.166 --> 34:41.375
giving the guys cover
so they're not apprised--

34:41.458 --> 34:42.666
Apprehended.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.666
[laughs] Um, fuck, no.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.166
Come on, man.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.083
When we held up that tavern in Mayton,

34:49.166 --> 34:53.666
I had to wear that fucking sweaty,
Nilfgaardian ball-sack armor for hours.

34:53.750 --> 34:56.875
We agreed. Next time, you do the dress-up.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.958
You shitting words out of your mouth-hole
does not equal a deal.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.333
I agreed to nothing.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.250
-You do look smart in 'em.
-Really?

35:05.750 --> 35:08.541
Yeah, sure thing. You look proper nice.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.875
Yeah, look. Oh, wow.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.916
Now, remember,
you're Commissioner of Sport.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.375
You're really fancy.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.625
But not that fancy. Give me your sword.

35:18.708 --> 35:22.416
-I am not going anywhere unarmed.
-Swords are forbidden since the rebellion.

35:23.041 --> 35:26.250
-No one follows that.
-[Reef] Law-abiding citizens do.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.708
Besides, you got me outside.
Just whistle if anything goes wrong.

35:29.791 --> 35:32.166
[scoffs] But nothin's gonna go wrong.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.666
-[panting]
-[Kayleigh groaning]

35:33.750 --> 35:35.666
-Wh… whistle!
-[clattering and thumping]

35:35.750 --> 35:38.416
-Whi… whistle, whistle, whistle!
-[man] Come here! Yah!

35:38.500 --> 35:39.875
-[Kayleigh] Fuck.
-[man grunting]

35:39.958 --> 35:41.791
-[Reef] Which one?
-[Asse] Uh, I don't know.

35:41.875 --> 35:42.708
[Reef] Fuck.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.458
[groaning]

35:46.541 --> 35:48.000
[man] Oof! Get off!

35:48.916 --> 35:50.041
[Kayleigh] Ah, ah, ah!

35:50.125 --> 35:51.375
Seriously?

35:52.250 --> 35:53.416
[man yelps]

35:54.416 --> 35:55.500
[thud]

35:58.833 --> 36:02.125
And that's why I should be
in the goddamn fight ring, Giz.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.625
Did you just kill a guy with a book
for a seal of wax?

36:12.958 --> 36:15.125
Apprehended, bitch.

36:15.208 --> 36:17.750
Giz! Giz, I can't fight.

36:17.833 --> 36:19.916
[Mistle] It's okay, Asse.
You won't have to.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
[Giselher] We'll be on the boat
before you have to.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.291
It's just about giving us cover to escape.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.625
[Mistle] When guards are busy
keepin' a mob under control,

36:26.708 --> 36:28.458
they aren't seein' us jack their shit.

36:28.541 --> 36:30.416
[witcher] I saw you jack my shit.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.750
-That's my fuckin' chair.
-What are you doing?

36:39.041 --> 36:41.125
Ingredients for witchers' elixir.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.583
It's cooking sherry.

36:43.708 --> 36:45.291
What's more pathetic?

36:45.375 --> 36:47.583
That you can't go a day without drinking,

36:47.666 --> 36:50.416
or that you can't make up
a half-decent lie to cover?

36:50.500 --> 36:53.333
Have you always been
such a devout little asshole?

36:53.416 --> 36:54.916
I converted later in life.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.375
[Iskra] Enough, you two! Stop bickering!

36:58.083 --> 37:00.833
So, how do we get in?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.541
We are gonna get invited.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.166
-[moaning]
-[blows landing]

37:05.250 --> 37:08.666
Our cover story is that
we're newlyweds looking for some action.

37:08.750 --> 37:11.416
Our mark is a high-end brothel in Rocayne.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.458
I know the owner,
an old friend from my army days.

37:14.958 --> 37:16.250
Miss Skret.

37:17.416 --> 37:19.208
[Miss Skret] Up jumped the devil.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.333
Ooh.

37:22.416 --> 37:24.375
The things I could do with that mouth.

37:24.458 --> 37:26.833
Miss Skret, this is my friend, Iskra.

37:26.916 --> 37:28.250
Iskra, Miss Skret.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.291
-Pleasure.
-Is that my guy?

37:30.375 --> 37:32.041
-You see…
-[Miss Skret] That's the Baron.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.958
You need an invite, he's your man.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.583
The cute one. In the leather.

37:36.666 --> 37:39.458
-He's your--
-My heel. Got it.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.375
Leave his pretty face, though.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.333
Sure.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.541
Mmm!

37:52.625 --> 37:54.458
-[yelps]
-That's my mother, you prick.

37:54.541 --> 37:56.875
-Oh! Stop it!
-I'm gonna pull your teeth out.

37:56.958 --> 37:59.541
-[Baron] Stop it!
-[Giselher] Get off him, you arsehole.

38:01.541 --> 38:05.708
You know, I've offered that boy
every pleasure under the sun.

38:05.791 --> 38:07.208
And nothing turns his head.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.625
But he sure breaks his neck
looking at you.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.083
[blows landing]

38:14.708 --> 38:17.125
[Giselher] Once he takes the bait,
you come help me charm him.

38:17.208 --> 38:19.416
-[Baron whimpering] Oh, oh!
-Darling?

38:19.500 --> 38:21.833
You promised me,
no brawling on our honeymoon.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.916
-My poor lamb. Are you all right?
-[gasping]

38:24.000 --> 38:25.750
[Giselher] He invests
in Houvenaghel's arenas.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.750
[Baron] You saved my life.

38:27.833 --> 38:30.958
Please, let me repay you
for your assistance.

38:31.041 --> 38:34.458
[Giselher] An invite from him means
unlimited access on fight night.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.250
[stamps]

38:39.916 --> 38:41.000
Et voilà.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.791
If you will excuse me.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.666
[Giselher] Now for
the tricky part of the plan.

38:47.791 --> 38:49.041
How do you kill a monster?

38:50.833 --> 38:53.166
[sighs] Depends on the monster.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.625
I'm gonna have to do some research.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.208
Mind-numbing,
excruciatingly boring research.

38:59.291 --> 39:01.708
And when I say I, I mean you, partner.

39:01.791 --> 39:03.916
-Now, where can we find some wild herbs?
-[Iskra] Oh!

39:04.000 --> 39:05.041
[waves breaking]

39:05.125 --> 39:06.583
[Mistle panting]

39:08.291 --> 39:09.625
These too, Rat.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.916
We've been at this for hours.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.208
My fingers are pricked to hell.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.958
What's even in witcher elixirs?

39:20.041 --> 39:23.041
What makes you go fast
and see in the dark and shit?

39:24.291 --> 39:27.583
Oh my God.
You don't even remember, do you?

39:27.666 --> 39:29.416
I remember, kinda.

39:30.083 --> 39:32.500
The details have just gone
a little, uh… fuzzy.

39:32.583 --> 39:36.125
What other vital knowledge
have you lost to liquor?

39:36.208 --> 39:37.333
[gull calling]

39:37.416 --> 39:42.541
Talk to me about this thing that sliced
your boy's leg open. The… Jalo-what's-it.

39:42.625 --> 39:43.708
Jalowik.

39:44.291 --> 39:47.083
It was dark and that thing was fast.
I didn't get a good look.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.708
But when I first caught sight of it
before it attacked, it made me think…

39:54.166 --> 39:56.958
It looked like a human in the darkness.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.916
Keep lookin' through that book.

40:00.958 --> 40:04.375
I'm tellin' you,
there's nothing in here about a Jalowik.

40:04.458 --> 40:08.000
Best I've got
is monsters don't like silver swords.

40:09.083 --> 40:12.333
-So do that.
-You want your money, right? Huh?

40:12.833 --> 40:15.833
If I'm gonna kill the damn thing,
I need answers.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.541
So keep lookin'.

40:17.625 --> 40:18.583
[Mistle] Fine.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.625
You still remember
how to swing a sword, though, right?

40:22.708 --> 40:25.583
You keep up your whining,
and we'll find out.

40:29.041 --> 40:30.916
And don't forget those herbs either.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.750
[Giselher] We only have five days left.

40:33.833 --> 40:36.291
We need a big distraction
for when it's time to escape.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.916
But more importantly,
we need Brehen to be ready.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.625
The research, the elixir, we still don't
have what we need, so get it together.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.541
-[Reef] Come on. Come on. Yes!
-[Asse] One, two.

40:44.625 --> 40:46.791
-Three, four…
-Duck!

40:46.875 --> 40:47.875
[Asse winces]

40:48.458 --> 40:50.833
-Watch it.
-If he dies, it's your fault.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.208
Do you think I don't know that?

40:55.083 --> 40:57.041
Okay, Asse. Let's go again. Hands up.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.291
-[Asse] Oh, I don't wanna.
-[Reef] To your face. Combo.

40:59.375 --> 41:02.291
Let's go. One, two, three, yeah?
Right, from the slip.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.291
-[Asse] What?
-[Reef] The bit you keep fucking up.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.500
-[Asse] From the slip?
-[Reef] Yes. Okay. Body. Body!

41:06.583 --> 41:08.166
-Take the back. The back!
-[Iskra humming]

41:08.250 --> 41:10.500
-[Asse] What do you mean?
-[Reef] Let's go! Come on, today.

41:10.583 --> 41:12.500
-One, two.
-[Asse] One, two.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.666
[Reef] Duck. Again.

41:13.750 --> 41:15.875
-Now, come on. Combo. Two, yes.
-[Iskra humming]

41:15.958 --> 41:16.791
[sizzling]

41:16.875 --> 41:17.750
[Reef] Duck!

41:17.833 --> 41:19.583
-[Brehen] Mother--
-[Giselher groans]

41:19.666 --> 41:22.791
-This is a delicate process, numbnuts.
-No shit.

41:22.875 --> 41:25.291
-[Asse] Reef, I can't do better.
-[Reef] Get ahold of yourself.

41:25.375 --> 41:27.916
-[Kayleigh] Can't get it to stabilize.
-[Giselher] There's no time.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.458
-Focus on your work.
-[clatters]

41:29.541 --> 41:31.333
-[Kayleigh] Shit.
-[Reef] Come on. Look at me.

41:31.416 --> 41:32.791
-Go again.
-[Asse] Shit, Reef.

41:32.875 --> 41:34.375
-[Reef] To your face.
-[Iskra humming]

41:34.458 --> 41:36.416
-Protect yourself.
-[Asse] I'm protecting myself.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.458
[Reef] Body. From the bit
you keep fucking up.

41:38.541 --> 41:40.625
-Take the back. Take the back!
-What do you mean?

41:40.708 --> 41:42.416
-[Reef] For fuck's sake!
-Aah!

41:42.500 --> 41:43.666
[yells]

41:44.666 --> 41:46.208
[roars]

41:47.416 --> 41:49.083
[panting]

41:50.875 --> 41:51.791
Gah!

41:57.625 --> 41:59.583
-[Asse gasps]
-[Brehen] Out of my way.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.291
No money's worth this.

42:07.916 --> 42:08.833
Fuckin' kids.

42:11.125 --> 42:12.333
[yells]

42:14.833 --> 42:16.958
How can you stand it, all this bullshit?

42:17.541 --> 42:19.833
I'd rather live in a den of vampires.

42:22.833 --> 42:26.833
Vampires, of the classification
succubus immortalis.

42:26.916 --> 42:30.125
Highly intelligent and sensitive beings.

42:30.666 --> 42:32.000
You wouldn't last a week.

42:32.958 --> 42:35.583
-I'm not really good with people.
-No shit.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.291
What's your deal?

42:40.291 --> 42:42.958
The School of the Cat,
where I came up, it was…

42:43.750 --> 42:45.041
It was a nightmare.

42:45.125 --> 42:48.416
Any connection was deemed
a weakness, a liability,

42:48.500 --> 42:50.166
so they kept us isolated.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.666
Even from each other.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.083
[poignant music playing]

42:53.166 --> 42:55.000
So, after that,

42:55.500 --> 42:57.041
all I could feel was rage.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.041
That's why you drink.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.041
To numb it.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.750
That feeling, like you're on a fire.

43:08.125 --> 43:11.250
I had someone
who helped me numb it. Juniper.

43:13.791 --> 43:15.125
After she died,

43:16.250 --> 43:19.958
it's like…
everything just burned all the time.

43:28.291 --> 43:29.916
What happened with the striga?

43:31.708 --> 43:34.291
You heard the story.
I ran off with the money.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.916
Left that cursed girl
to butcher the village.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.916
You might be a terrible witcher,
but you don't strike me as a crook.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.541
Like I said, I'm…

43:44.208 --> 43:45.541
I'm not good with people.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.708
[sighs] But the job doesn't help.

43:52.375 --> 43:54.375
Then one day, I met this guy.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.666
Remus.

43:56.708 --> 43:57.833
He was a witcher like me.

43:57.916 --> 44:02.291
He came from the School of the Wolf.
They treated each other like brothers.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.875
That's the way he treated me.
I didn't know it could be like that.

44:06.958 --> 44:09.333
He saved my ass on a job in Kovir.

44:11.625 --> 44:13.416
We start travellin' together, and

44:14.250 --> 44:15.875
splittin' jobs.

44:18.416 --> 44:20.250
Watching each other's backs.

44:21.083 --> 44:23.750
King Foltest offered to double our pay

44:24.250 --> 44:26.916
if we could save the striga
instead of killin' it.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.208
How can you save a monster?

44:29.958 --> 44:32.291
She wasn't a monster. She was just a girl.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.708
A girl who'd been cursed. Used.

44:35.791 --> 44:39.041
That's what I said
to talk him into takin' the job. [sighs]

44:41.875 --> 44:44.083
I didn't give a shit about that girl.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.416
I just wanted the money.

44:52.083 --> 44:53.791
Got him killed for it.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.500
[intriguing music playing]

45:06.958 --> 45:07.958
A malediction.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.083
What?

45:09.166 --> 45:12.458
It's a mixture between a curse
and an alchemical experimentation.

45:13.916 --> 45:17.333
What if Brigden used one of his girls
to make this thing?

45:18.416 --> 45:20.791
-The Jalowik.
-Malediction?

45:21.375 --> 45:23.083
[laughs] Of course!

45:23.166 --> 45:26.000
We have to counter the magic
infused in its body.

45:26.083 --> 45:28.666
We'd need an extraction tonic for it.

45:29.166 --> 45:32.458
Subdue the curse,
the monster becomes vulnerable.

45:32.541 --> 45:33.916
I can kill it.

45:37.791 --> 45:38.958
Good job, Rat.

45:41.333 --> 45:42.333
Thanks.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.250
After your girlfriend died,

45:52.583 --> 45:54.041
what helped you numb it?

45:55.208 --> 45:56.416
The burning?

46:00.083 --> 46:01.083
Them.

46:01.583 --> 46:04.333
At that Lammas festival in Geso,
that's where we met.

46:04.416 --> 46:06.250
A bunch of orphans of war.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.958
But we made a blood pact

46:09.708 --> 46:10.916
to stick together.

46:13.583 --> 46:14.750
See?

46:15.750 --> 46:17.750
The truth is,
you can never really numb it.

46:18.250 --> 46:22.375
All you can do is find the people you want
to go out in a blaze of glory with and…

46:24.250 --> 46:25.375
light a match.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.833
[inspiring music swells]

46:43.541 --> 46:45.208
[music fades]

46:45.291 --> 46:46.958
[wind gusting]

46:57.583 --> 46:58.791
Get dressed.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.500
[birdsong]

47:04.208 --> 47:05.625
[Reef] No offense, Grandpa.

47:05.708 --> 47:08.125
What makes you think
you can teach Bonehead how to fight

47:08.208 --> 47:09.958
when I've already rocked your shit twice?

47:10.041 --> 47:11.750
Who said anything about teaching?

47:11.833 --> 47:14.166
I'm tryin' to get back
into fightin' shape.

47:14.250 --> 47:16.750
Let's see you go three for three, dipshit.

47:16.833 --> 47:18.083
You should know…

47:20.375 --> 47:21.333
I'm sober now.

47:21.416 --> 47:22.916
[flies buzzing]

47:48.041 --> 47:50.041
-[cracking]
-[groans]

47:51.500 --> 47:53.625
Sobriety isn't so much
of a superpower as you thought.

47:53.708 --> 47:55.000
-Huh, Gramps?
-[yells]

47:55.625 --> 47:56.875

[Reef grunts]

48:00.166 --> 48:01.416
[both panting]

48:07.625 --> 48:08.458
Hey.

48:08.958 --> 48:10.041
Come up here.

48:11.583 --> 48:15.250
Look. The secret to fighting
isn't forgetting your fear.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.333
It's embracing it.

48:16.916 --> 48:18.583
Fear means you're alive.

48:18.666 --> 48:20.000
And if you're alive,

48:20.916 --> 48:22.416
you're already winning.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.208
Come up here.

48:27.208 --> 48:28.875
All right. Come on.

48:29.458 --> 48:32.791
Plant your feet. Square your shoulders.
This way. This way.

48:32.875 --> 48:33.833
This way.

48:34.333 --> 48:35.916
Okay. There you go.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.541
Give me a jab.

48:37.625 --> 48:39.583
Come on. Snap it up. Snap it out!

48:39.666 --> 48:41.625
Right hand. Right hand.

48:41.708 --> 48:43.708
[thrilling music playing]

48:45.958 --> 48:47.833
[panting]

49:09.000 --> 49:10.166
Come on, man.

49:10.666 --> 49:11.916
[Brehen grunting]

49:18.791 --> 49:19.791

50:01.125 --> 50:03.125
[Reef laughing]

50:26.500 --> 50:29.208
-[Reef] Yeah, look at that.
-[Kayleigh] Fuckin' hell.

50:29.291 --> 50:30.250
[Reef] Okay.

50:32.583 --> 50:33.500
-Ah!
-[Kayleigh] No!

50:33.583 --> 50:34.791
[Reef] One more time. One more.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.416
-[Kayleigh] Not again. No!
-[Reef] Yes!

50:36.500 --> 50:38.000
-Pay up, bitch!
-[playing mournful tune]

50:38.083 --> 50:39.958
[Reef] Give me your money. Come on.

50:40.750 --> 50:42.250
[laughing]

50:42.333 --> 50:43.958
[Iskra humming softly]

50:44.041 --> 50:45.875
[Reef] I'm smashing it today.

50:46.708 --> 50:48.375
You're shit at this.

50:54.166 --> 50:55.125
[Brehen] Ahem.

50:56.375 --> 50:58.083
Feeling good about your plan?

50:58.875 --> 51:00.541
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

51:01.041 --> 51:04.916
Went over it, like, a thousand times?
Know every move you're gonna make?

51:06.250 --> 51:07.125
Yep.

51:08.333 --> 51:10.875
Then why the hell aren't you
over there dancing with her?

51:10.958 --> 51:12.958
[Iskra humming]

51:17.291 --> 51:19.125
I really need to focus.

51:19.625 --> 51:22.333
You know, if this goes wrong tomorrow,
then that's on me.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.541
Look, kid, uh… I get it.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.083
You know, you wanna be in control

51:29.583 --> 51:32.375
of every bad thing
this world could throw at you

51:32.458 --> 51:36.750
'cause the other option, like,
destiny's in charge, is so much worse.

51:37.250 --> 51:41.416
But trust me when I say that tomorrow

51:41.916 --> 51:44.375
doesn't give a fuck about today's plans.

51:46.375 --> 51:48.041
So go dance with the girl.

51:54.125 --> 51:56.125
[intriguing music playing]

52:55.041 --> 52:55.916
Brehen.

52:56.541 --> 52:57.916
We've got a problem. Hurry.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.666
-Happy Lammas!
-[all] Happy Lammas!

53:05.750 --> 53:07.041
[Kayleigh] Whoo-hoo!

53:07.125 --> 53:09.041
[Reef laughing] Yeah!

53:10.708 --> 53:12.458
Happy Lammas, old man.

53:13.041 --> 53:15.083
Well, since we might die tomorrow,

53:15.166 --> 53:17.375
might as well live it up tonight,
right, Gramps?

53:17.458 --> 53:18.458
[Kayleigh laughs]

53:18.541 --> 53:20.708
It's not every day
that we get to be monster killers.

53:20.791 --> 53:22.833
Feels like something to celebrate, right?

53:24.833 --> 53:26.083
[sighs]

53:26.166 --> 53:27.083
We will.

53:27.958 --> 53:29.041
Tomorrow.

53:30.208 --> 53:31.875
After we finish the job.

53:36.375 --> 53:37.291
Well,

53:38.583 --> 53:40.708
we gotta mark the occasion somehow.

53:41.458 --> 53:42.916
It's a Lammas tradition.

53:53.166 --> 53:54.291
Hmm.

54:01.041 --> 54:02.458
You Rat.

54:06.833 --> 54:08.625
[all laughing and cheering]

54:08.708 --> 54:10.250
-[Reef] Yeah!
-[Kayleigh] Whoo!

54:17.125 --> 54:18.833
[Reef] Come on, guys. Let's party.

54:20.583 --> 54:21.750
[playing wistful tune]

54:22.625 --> 54:25.291
[Mistle] Asse, what's that tune?
What's that tune?

54:27.458 --> 54:28.625
[sighs]

54:29.583 --> 54:31.583
[emotional music swells]

54:44.333 --> 54:45.333
[Kayleigh] Here we are.

54:45.958 --> 54:47.958
-Here.
-[Reef] Come on, Mistle!

55:02.750 --> 55:04.333
-[fighter grunts]
-[man] Yeah!

55:05.000 --> 55:07.625
[barker] You know the rules, people!

55:08.125 --> 55:11.708
Twelve fights,
and only one possible outcome!

55:12.583 --> 55:16.583
-Finish him!
-[barker] Victory or death!

55:20.583 --> 55:23.416
We have champions
from all over the Continent

55:23.500 --> 55:25.958
and even from beyond!

55:26.625 --> 55:29.375
Who will take it all?

55:30.375 --> 55:33.041
She's good, jacked with vile root.

55:33.541 --> 55:36.041
I pity the poor bastards
you're planning to feed to her.

55:36.125 --> 55:39.666
Well, I'm so glad
you've finally stopped pissin' your pants.

55:39.750 --> 55:43.166
'Cause when this works,
no one will care how we got here.

55:43.250 --> 55:47.166
Only that we sold 'em
the weapon that won the war.

55:48.958 --> 55:50.166
[man] Mr. Brigden.

55:51.166 --> 55:54.125
-Commissioner.
-Emperor Emhyr sends his regards.

55:54.208 --> 55:55.625
[guard] Invitations, please.

55:57.416 --> 55:58.333
[audience cheer]

55:59.916 --> 56:01.125
[Giselher] Big turnout.

56:01.916 --> 56:06.958
-Looks like it'll be an exciting night.
-Indeed. A night to remember.

Lovely. Keep going.

56:30.666 --> 56:33.416
Enjoy that beak while you can, gorgeous.

56:33.500 --> 56:36.916
My boy here? He's about
to beat it off your fuckin' face.

[Reef and Kayleigh laughing]

56:49.666 --> 56:50.708
[Reef] Loser!

56:50.791 --> 56:51.833
You're dead.

56:53.041 --> 56:54.375
[chuckles]

57:01.791 --> 57:03.458
[guard] Have a great evening, sir.

57:05.291 --> 57:06.541
Invitation and weapon.

57:06.625 --> 57:08.333
[man] Come on! Kill him!

57:09.125 --> 57:10.208
Ask me that again.

57:10.291 --> 57:12.333
[guard] Beggars aren't welcome here.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.125
Fool!

57:14.833 --> 57:17.791
Mr. Bonhart, what a surprise.

57:18.416 --> 57:20.541
Please, allow me to show you around.

57:20.625 --> 57:23.291
[barker] Halftime is almost over, folks.

57:23.375 --> 57:25.791
[Bert] Your cousin made a smart choice.

57:25.875 --> 57:28.375
This location is excellent.

57:28.958 --> 57:30.666
And as you can see,

57:31.166 --> 57:33.000
we've got it all under control.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.416
[woman 1] Final chance to bet. Sir, madam?

57:38.291 --> 57:40.833
Tell you what,
why don't I have one of my girls

57:40.916 --> 57:42.208
take you to me other enterprise?

57:42.291 --> 57:43.625
[woman 2] Place your bets, please!

57:43.708 --> 57:48.458
-Soft beds. Even softer company.
-[woman 2] Last chance to make a bet!

57:48.541 --> 57:51.583
You mistake what kind of action
I'm interested in.

57:52.750 --> 57:53.625
Besides,

57:55.250 --> 57:57.708
Dom's got a lot invested in this.

57:58.625 --> 58:01.750
I would hate for him to think
that I wasn't being supportive.

58:01.833 --> 58:04.000
Yeah, course. Yeah.

58:05.541 --> 58:06.500
Yeah.

58:07.791 --> 58:08.916
Right this way, Mr. Bonhart.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.333
-[woman 2] Last chance!
-[woman 3] Final call for bets.

58:11.416 --> 58:15.250
-[bell ringing]
-Final call, everybody. Final call.

58:16.833 --> 58:19.166
Final call for bets.

58:19.250 --> 58:20.541
Showtime.

58:21.291 --> 58:25.291
[barker] And the bloodbath continues
for our second half of the night.

58:25.375 --> 58:27.875
[Giselher] After halftime,
our clock starts.

58:27.958 --> 58:29.625
That's when the guards
will be the busiest.

58:30.791 --> 58:33.958
First we smuggle that silver sword in,
southern style.

58:34.458 --> 58:36.375
A Gemmeran horse, like the casino.

58:36.458 --> 58:37.791
-Exactly.
-Oh. Come here.

58:37.875 --> 58:40.416
[Giselher] This time, we'll be doing it
from Brigden's back office.

58:40.500 --> 58:42.041
[Bert] This room is off-limits.

58:42.125 --> 58:44.000
-[Giselher] It will be lightly guarded.
-Hi.

58:44.083 --> 58:45.958
-I'm sorry--
-I'm looking for Bert Brigden.

58:49.625 --> 58:52.916
[Giselher] Armed guards make sure that
no one can get close to the bet boxes.

58:53.416 --> 58:55.875
Except the money girls who carry them.

58:57.083 --> 58:58.750
They are our ticket to the vault.

59:00.666 --> 59:03.791
We'll have less than half an hour
to kill a monster and steal the money

59:03.875 --> 59:05.541
before Asse's fight starts.

59:08.083 --> 59:11.458
Once we're out the vault,
Kayleigh and Reef will cover our escape.

59:12.333 --> 59:14.000
And this time, no distractions.

59:17.541 --> 59:20.125
Asse cannot get into that fight ring.

59:20.208 --> 59:21.583
Whoo!

59:22.333 --> 59:23.375
Come on!

59:24.416 --> 59:25.666
[crowd yelling]

59:32.916 --> 59:33.750
Let's go.

59:42.166 --> 59:43.833
-[Mistle] We're in.
-We ready?

59:44.583 --> 59:48.750
Remember, it's only vulnerable
once I give it the extraction tonic.

59:48.833 --> 59:50.041
Then I'll kill it.

59:50.541 --> 59:52.125
Kayleigh said to give you this.

59:52.625 --> 59:53.666
Just in case.

Come on.

[hisses]

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:23.541
Juniper?

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:24.791
[hisses]

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:31.208
Juniper.

01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.708
[echoing] Juniper…

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.166
[poignant music playing]

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.375
-[Brehen roars]
-[snarls]

01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:51.666
-[yells]
-[Mistle] No!

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.541
[Brehen] What are you doing? [yells]

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.791
-[yells]
-[screeches]

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:01.208
-No! It's Juniper!
-What?

01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:03.875
She's alive. You can't kill her.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:06.041
Mistle, you're seeing ghosts again.

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:08.333
[Mistle] It's her.
There must be a way to save her.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.541
What the fuck?

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:11.250
[Brehen] All I've done is
weaken the curse.

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:14.833
To remove it completely,
it has to be transferred to someone else.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.375
[Giselher] We have no time.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.958
We have to save her.

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:20.125
Please, Brehen.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:25.000
She's just a cursed girl who's been used.
Tell me what to do. Tell me.

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:27.583
[sighs]

01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:30.250
[barker] Humongous is
taking them out quickly tonight!

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:31.208
[fighter] Yeah!

01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:33.333
[Kayleigh] I'm telling you,
they'll be out any minute.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:35.583
-[fighter] Now, who is next?
-[Kayleigh] Calm down.

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:40.416
[barker] And now, a special word
from our esteemed hosts.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.916
[Til] Ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.291
we have a special surprise
in store for you this evening.

01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:51.541
An exhibition fight
with a new kind of fighter

01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:55.750
that will stop the waste
of your precious combat resources

01:03:55.833 --> 01:04:01.708
and allow the real cleansing
of our great Continent to begin.

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:04.625
Make sure you stay till the end.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:08.583
-You won't regret this.
-[crowd cheering]

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.666

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.916
[crowd clamoring]

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.458
[chanting] Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:19.375
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.458
A special surprise?

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:23.166
-Hmm.
-[Leo] Hmm?

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:26.208
-Well, that one's always goin' off book.
-[man] Hey!

01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.833
[Bert] Let me find out.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.875
-[fighter] Rah!
-[man] Come on!

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:34.625
[cheering]

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.791
[Til] It's Leo Bonhart.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.750
I told you it was a bad idea.

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:46.625
-What is he doing here?
-Fuck you.

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:48.916
And everything is under control.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.291
We're gonna stick to the plan
and cut him in.

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:56.083
To go against his cousin, our boss?

01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:59.458
-I'll have you remember he's a--
-Money speaks, you simpleton.

01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:04.000
The only thing that speaks to Leo Bonhart

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:05.958
is torture and death.

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:08.750
I'm out.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:12.833
[Mistle] Brigden!

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.291

-[shrieks]
-[roars]

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:20.625
[gasping] You sick fuck.
What did you do to her?

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:21.708
Aah!

01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.541
-The bride back from the grave.
-Aah!

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.041
I shouldn't be surprised
to see you here today.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.250
Juniper's big debut and all.

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:33.291
You didn't think I'd waste
such a pretty little thing, did you?

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:34.416
[Mistle shrieks]

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.666
-[panting]
-[Bert groans]

01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.458
Oh, petal wants to play.

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:43.958

-[Bert] Well, let's play then, shall we?

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:46.541

01:05:46.625 --> 01:05:48.291

[barker] Shockin' shocks!

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.916
Humongous bites the dust!

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.666
Where the fuck are they?

01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:59.833
I don't know, man.

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:01.833
-[Bert snarling]
-Mistle, we need to go.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:02.958
Asse's running out of time.

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:05.208
-[Mistle] I know. But I can't leave her.

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:09.583
[screeches]

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.333
[Mistle] Brehen, transfer the curse.

01:06:11.416 --> 01:06:13.791
-[Giselher] We need to get to the boats.
-Giz…

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.583
[dramatic music playing]

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:18.791
That's not happening.

Juniper!

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:35.333
[Iskra] Mistle, it's too late. Let her go.

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:38.375
-[Leo] Oh, you've been busy, Brigden.
-[Bert gasping]

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:41.583
-Dom will be very disappointed.
-No, no. It's all good.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:44.000
It's, uh… I didn't wanna tell you until--

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.375
[barker] We have a newcomer tonight,

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:50.000
the Babyface of Thurn!

01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:53.666
-And his stats are impressive!
-[fighter laughing]

01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:56.458

01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:57.500

[blade rings]

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.625
I don't have one of those yet.

[Brehen] Stay back, kids. [groans]

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.125

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:36.708
[barker] Will the Babyface of Thurn
be up to this ultimate duel?

-I can't.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

[Juniper] Hold on to it.

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:06.708
Look at me.
If anyone comes for you, kill them.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:08.375
I don't think I can do it.

01:09:08.458 --> 01:09:09.666
[echoing] Yes, you can.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:12.958
And if anyone comes
for your family, you will.

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:03.958
[stone ringing]

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.291
[music fades]

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.958
[horse neighs]

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.791
Look at all that money. [chuckles]

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.125
We couldn't spend it all
even if we fuckin' try.

01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:28.541
And look at you all,

01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:31.250
sittin' here cryin'
like a bunch of fuckin' babies.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.625
[giggles]

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:34.666
[sobbing]

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.750
[poignant music playing]

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:49.791
[Iskra sighs]

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:53.875
[Reef sobbing]

01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:56.458
Come on.

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:11.541
[sighs]

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.125
To family.

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.291
[sighs]

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:24.291
All seven of us.

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:29.708
[sighs]

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.666
To Brehen,

01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:35.250
the worst witcher we ever met.

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.958
[laughs]

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:43.875
To bein' alive.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.916
'Cause if you're alive,

01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:49.833
means you're already winnin'.

01:15:57.708 --> 01:16:00.833
To the reignin' champion of Amarillo.

01:16:02.541 --> 01:16:04.083
You were good in there, brother.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:15.791
[sighs] To Juniper.

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:28.666
To the possibility of a future.

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:32.541
[laughing]

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:35.333
We survived.

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:37.666
What now?

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.083
This city will be hot for a while.

01:16:40.166 --> 01:16:43.000
Dom Houvenaghel's gonna be out for blood.

01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:45.875
-Let's not stick around and wait.
-Yeah.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:52.458
I'm not scared of any of that shit,
'cause I've got you guys.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.541
But it's time
to say goodbye to the ghosts.

01:16:57.416 --> 01:16:58.666
For good.

01:17:05.666 --> 01:17:09.541
You know, I hear things are hoppin'
in Glyswen right now.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:10.958
[Giselher] I heard that too.

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:14.666
The Nissir gang's got all kinds
of crazy deals that we can exploit.

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:17.416
Let's go.

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:19.000
[Iskra] Let's go!

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.666
[lively music playing]

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.458
[Reef] Shotgun!

01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:42.958
[music fades]

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:48.041
[Leo] And that is how the Rats survived
their blaze of glory

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.333
long enough to join forces with you.

01:17:52.416 --> 01:17:54.750
But as you now know, Falka,

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:56.375
in the end…

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:57.791
[sighs]

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.333
…I always win.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.916
