TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.569
TYPHOON TRADING

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.155
My name is Kim Jeong-hyeon,
the director of sales at Kangseong Helmet.

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.160
-I'm Bae In-ho, the head of development.
-Nice to meet you.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:59.289
My name is Go Ma-jin,
the sales team leader.

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:00.748
-Mr. Go Ma-jin.
-Yes.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:07.088
And I am CEO Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:08.798
Please have some coffee.

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:11.092
-I am Oh Mi-seon, the senior staff.
-Hello.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.595
Please have some coffee.

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.221
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.142
We should've been
the ones to visit you first.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.476
Goodness, don't say that.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.812
We came because we were curious.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:24.939
We wanted to see the company

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:28.443
that wanted to sell our helmet
to another country.

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:31.446
Something like this rarely happens.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.365
I wanted to taste your coffee too.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:37.118
Now, about these…

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.996
This is a full-face helmet,
and this is an open-face one.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.790
Doesn't the full-face helmet
already look sturdy?

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:46.210
But the open-face helmet is exposed,

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:50.381
so it's very easy to put on and take off,
and it's much cheaper too.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.718
I see. But these seem a bit…

00:01:54.552 --> 00:01:56.763
They seem like they'll break easily.

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:58.056
Helmets need to break.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.893
If it doesn't break, your head will.

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.354
-I see.
-The impact will go to the head.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:09.984
My goodness!

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.824
It's fine.

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.247
However, what you need to see
is the inside.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.043
This is…

00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:30.880
-Then, Director Kim.
-Yes?

00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:33.758
What would be the minimum order?

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.760
We begin at 1,000 helmets,

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:38.930
but we can negotiate in this situation
and start at 500 pieces.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.557
Is it possible to purchase on credit?

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.435
I'll have to see some documents,
but the amount isn't significant,

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.895
so it's probably possible.

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:47.939
Thank you for coming today.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:50.108
-Sure.
-I'll see you next time. Thank you.

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.859
-Goodbye. Great meeting.
-Goodbye.

00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:58.199
You don't have to see us off.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.784
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.327
We won't see you off then.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.168
Now, we have the products.

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.677
Cut it out.
I was going to throw that helmet away.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.139
Where do you want to sell it to?

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:24.475
They're already selling to America,
Europe, the Arab countries, Singapore,

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.311
Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and just about everywhere.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.480
Where would you sell them?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.907
IMF PROVIDES AID FOLLOWING AGREEMENT

GREENLAND

00:03:54.714 --> 00:03:57.508
-That sounds cold.
-Isn't that way up in the north?

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:58.593
NORTH AMERICA

00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:01.095
SOUTH AMERICA

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.847
ARGENTINA

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.806
Argentina?

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:05.725
Up here.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:07.435
RUSSIA - ASIA

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:08.353
NORTH PACIFIC

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:09.937
And how about here?

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:11.939
What are we going to do
in the middle of the sea?

00:04:12.023 --> 00:04:13.107
This is Hawaii.

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.695
-How about this?
-Maybe Australia.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.239
No, we can't go with Australia.

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.867
-We're moving again?
-Are you traveling around the world?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.243
It's going to be…

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.377
THAILAND

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.711
…Thailand.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.213
Thailand?

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:36.756
What do you mean, Thailand?

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:39.175
They've suffered
from the IMF crisis before us.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:40.676
Exactly.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.638
They've suffered first,
so they'll recover first too.

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.016
Haven't you ever taken the first blow?
It hurts like crazy.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.602
I'm usually the one
who throws the punch first.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.688
Do you think they'll buy these?
Is it even possible?

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:55.149
What's their current GNI?

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:00.113
-I'm not a part of the company.
-It's $370 billion.

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:01.697
Here's the thing.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:05.952
What's more important is
how much they spend, not earn.

00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:09.455
You all know
about the expensive German cars, right?

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.042
What's the country that bought
those cars the most after Germany?

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:15.837
Where's the city with the most number
of department stores?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.924
It's Thailand.

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:23.010
They have the highest purchasing power
in that region.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:26.055
It's only been two years
since helmets became mandatory.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.516
The law is going to be
much stricter this year.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.436
-This year? Why?
-Why is that?

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.064
BASEBALL DREAM TEAM WILL LEAVE FOR BANGKOK

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.193
-Right, Park Chan-ho.
-The Bangkok Asian Games.

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:41.445
What do you say?

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.948
In my opinion, the exchange rate
is what matters the most.

00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:47.743
The baht exchange rate hit the ATH
in January and began to go down.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.121
The decline was rapid,
so the recovery is quick too.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:51.414
It's a relief for us.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:55.960
Even if we sign a deal now,
we'd get paid way past May,

00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:59.463
so it wouldn't be too bad
if the rate rose this much.

00:05:59.547 --> 00:06:02.508
Sure, okay. Nice speech.
The buyer is what matters the most.

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:06.262
Who in Thailand
will actually buy our helmets?

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:08.764
We must find a customer first
before we make a sales effort,

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:11.058
so let's find
a trustworthy local middleman,

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:15.021
someone like Typhoon Trading in Thailand.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.363
Boss, the mango samples are here.

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:25.656
Hey, you're here.

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.870
-I wonder if the samples are any good.
-Hello, this is Sawaddee speaking.

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.414
Boss, you have a call.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:34.624
Okay.

00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:40.087
Who is it?

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.216
I guess I can't do that.

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:47.595
Who's calling me now?

00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.680
Goodness.

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:53.309
Hello, Sawaddee Trading.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.852
This is Go Ma-yong speaking.

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:58.856
Look who it is! You're Ma-jin!

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.483
Hey, it's been a while.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:01.776
Are you doing all right?

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:07.365
Anyway, you aren't calling me
sitting down like a rude punk, are you?

00:07:09.075 --> 00:07:10.534
What now?

00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:12.662
Helmets?

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:15.081
Yes, exactly. All right. Okay.

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:17.208
All right. I'll reach out to you.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.668
Bye.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.130
He's still making me exhausted.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:26.425
This guy is my second cousin,

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:30.221
who's been running a business
in Thailand for over 15 years now.

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:32.765
He seemed interested for now.

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:36.727
He asked for a sample first.

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:39.105
-A sample?
-Here's what we'll do.

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:41.857
I'll go to Kangseong and get the product.

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.820
-Okay.
-So let's send that as the sample.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.283
-What else do we need?
-He also asked for pictures.

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:51.993
Old pictures of the company.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:53.703
Old company pictures?

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:57.456
You can get that ready, Oh.
Get our visas ready.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.916
-Business visa.
-Yes, right.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.544
Mr. Go, she's no longer just Oh.
She's a senior staff member.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:04.714
For the photos…
I'll look for the photos, Ms. Oh.

00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:06.299
-Okay.
-It should be in my office.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:11.178
-Hey, Oh, stay there for a moment.
-Okay.

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:17.018
All right.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.688
Hey, Oh.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.150
No, Senior Staff Ms. Oh.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:25.901
Here's my thing.

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:30.281
This is how I'm built.

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:36.537
I'm not the type of guy who thinks badly
about women who join the workforce.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.705
However, I…

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:42.877
Well, I'm bringing this up
for your sake, Ms. Oh.

00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:48.674
But you getting directly involved
in sales doesn't seem…

00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:52.553
-quite proper.
-Sorry?

00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:56.349
You can relax and continue
to work as a bookkeeper.

00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.768
And if you want to do more,

00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:02.063
I guess you can pick up
some of Mr. Bae's work too.

00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:04.148
But when it comes to sales,

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.734
please hold yourself back.

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:10.488
It's not that I don't like you,

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:13.949
and I'm not looking down on you
because of your education.

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:16.285
It's not like your diploma
will help you sell more.

00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:17.828
My school isn't much, either.

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:21.165
In that case, only people like
Mr. Kang should be in sales.

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:28.089
Imagine a young woman like you
going abroad as the head of sales,

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:31.634
walking with your head up high.

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:35.638
What will our customers
think of our business?

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.099
It's obvious.

00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:42.728
Sales isn't that easy.

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:48.526
Think about it. Why do they call us
a trader or salesman?

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:51.195
Because there are no women in the game.

00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:59.495
Okay, Mr. Go. Thank you for your concern.

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:01.956
But you know,

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:05.501
I'll let the customers evaluate
how I am as a salesperson.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:10.756
Then I'll prove myself with numbers.

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.469
I don't know. How can I put this?

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:22.601
I don't think it's about men or women.

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.151
I just really want to be

00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:33.320
a trader.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.412
-I gave you my advice…
-Okay.

00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:43.748
Don't come crying to me later

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.793
and say things like,
"Why didn't you stop me?"

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:18.157
Hey, you're ruining the wheels!

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.536
I said I'd come alone.
You even had to leave your store.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.039
It's okay. Business was slow anyway.

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:27.833
Hey.

00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:30.878
Are you headed over there?

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:34.548
Yes, how did you know?

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:41.555
Hey.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:46.018
-So this is your home?
-Yes.

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.438
Ms. Oh will be thrilled.
Come in for a second.

00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:54.443
-You're back.
-Hi.

00:11:55.152 --> 00:11:56.153
It's so cold.

00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:05.496
What? This beautiful face,
even without half her brows,

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:07.540
is definitely my girlfriend, Mi-ho.

00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:10.125
Why does that punk, Tae-poong, live here?

00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:14.505
You didn't know? He lives with us.

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:16.298
He's the CEO of my sister's workplace.

00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:20.886
Darn it. Why did he come now?

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.012
THAI FOR BEGINNERS

00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:23.847
See you again.

00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:30.229
Good luck.

00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:31.605
See you again.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:34.400
Good luck. See you again.

00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:36.986
Good luck.

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.987
Ms. Oh?

00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:44.034
-Ms. Oh?
-My gosh.

00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:47.037
-Hey, Mr. Kang.
-I borrowed this.

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:48.914
We won't need to buy this anymore.

00:12:49.748 --> 00:12:52.751
Gosh, you didn't have to do this.

00:12:52.835 --> 00:12:54.920
-The handle should be sturdy.
-Okay.

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:58.007
Well, Mr. Kang.

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:01.385
By any chance,

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:06.140
if it's too inconvenient for me to go,
I can always stay here.

00:13:06.223 --> 00:13:08.100
What's inconvenient about that?

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:09.810
You're Typhoon Trading's trader.

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:13.188
And you're studying so hard too.

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:16.150
This is just my hobby.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:19.153
-Is that Thai? Sawasdee khap.
-Yes.

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:20.446
Sawasdee kha.

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:21.697
Hey, Tae-poong!

00:13:24.158 --> 00:13:26.952
-I'm going to stay the night.
-What? All of a sudden?

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:30.414
Is that you, my son?

00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:38.255
By any chance, are you Gap-sik's father?

00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:45.220
How dare you enter a home
full of women without consent?

00:13:45.304 --> 00:13:47.723
-Yes, man.
-Who's she?

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:52.061
-She's my grandma.
-We aren't going to buy anything!

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:53.812
Hello, Grandma.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.191
Hey, you're here, Nam-mo.

00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:59.902
So you're staying the night?
Should I sleep in Ms. Yeom's room?

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:02.279
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, I ate.

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:05.324
Do you know how to spin a top?
What about the striking trick?

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:06.575
He can't do any of those.

00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:09.286
-Who are you?
-The youngest here.

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:14.208
He's my younger brother, Beom.

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.001
Beom? That means tiger.

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:19.588
You have a dog too.

00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:33.143
Are you asleep, Tae-poong?

00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.480
You are.

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:38.816
Hey, no. I'm not asleep.

00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:43.988
Did I ever tell you
about the toilet that plays a melody?

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:46.115
Yes, you did. One too many times.

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:48.075
The toilet that plays music when you pee,

00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:50.494
the number one helmet in America,

00:14:50.577 --> 00:14:53.205
the thread that melts in your body,
and foldable bicycles too.

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:54.415
I've heard it too many times.

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:59.378
You have so many things you want to sell
that you can't even go to sleep.

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:03.007
I really hope you'll fall asleep soon.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.550
-Are you sleepy?
-No.

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:07.761
There are way too many things
to sell in this world.

00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:10.931
I even want to sell
the stones I see on the street.

00:15:11.015 --> 00:15:13.934
Yes, sure. Sell them all.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:27.197
How can this simple kid run a business?

00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:30.617
Good night. I'm going out.

00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:34.997
Seriously, I'm going to sell them all.

00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:54.475
Cuckoo.

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.518
No, this isn't right.

00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:59.271
How do cranes sing?

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:17.372
One, two…

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:22.377
Can you go alone?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.963
-I'll be right out front.
-Okay.

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:30.803
-Why weren't you asleep?
-Why were you gasping?

00:16:30.886 --> 00:16:33.055
I missed you too much. Let me see you.

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:36.642
You're this beautiful
even in the middle of the night,

00:16:36.725 --> 00:16:39.937
and you're right next door.
How can I sleep with this racing heart?

00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:42.022
I won't.

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:43.190
I just can't sleep.

00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:46.860
What's with you?
Get out of my face. Cut it out.

00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.406
That was a surprise.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.035
Did you say your name was Beom?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.622
May I call you my brother-in-law?

00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:00.833
Beom, my brother-in-law.

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:04.920
Mi-ho, you should go back inside.

00:17:05.003 --> 00:17:07.089
-What?
-Go back inside.

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:08.257
Oh, my. Okay.

00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.433
It's Mr. Beom. Call me Mr. Oh Beom.

00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:34.283
Let's go to sleep.

00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:38.579
Good night.

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:44.459
-No, wait a second.
-Why? I'm late for school.

00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:45.627
Eat before you go.

00:17:46.753 --> 00:17:48.297
Open up. Good boy.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.424
And take this. Here.

00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:51.341
Okay.

00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:52.801
Fire shot!

00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:54.887
Stop it!

00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:56.847
He surprised me.

00:18:00.142 --> 00:18:02.561
-I'm going to school!
-Don't run. You might fall!

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:05.606
I'm leaving too.

00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:08.192
-Little Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:18:15.908 --> 00:18:16.909
Hold this.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.123
Have this as you go.
You'll ruin your stomach if you don't eat.

00:18:26.877 --> 00:18:28.045
Thank you.

00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:30.297
What about my son?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.716
-Is he not here yet?
-I wonder.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.886
Something good must've happened.
He left early in the morning.

00:18:37.763 --> 00:18:39.473
I'll make breakfast for you.

00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:42.935
Okay. I'll take the picture.

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.312
One moment.

00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:56.740
There you go.

00:18:57.491 --> 00:18:58.700
It's for your passport.

00:18:59.743 --> 00:19:00.577
You look beautiful.

00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:06.333
All right, then. One, two, three.

00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:09.795
Another one.

00:19:10.504 --> 00:19:13.006
One, two, three.

00:19:27.854 --> 00:19:29.690
-Ms. Oh Mi-seon of Typhoon Trading?
-Yes.

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:32.234
-A delivery for you.
-Okay.

00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:35.821
-Please sign here.
-Sure.

00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:42.035
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

00:20:01.054 --> 00:20:01.972
It's here.

00:20:58.528 --> 00:20:59.654
You're up.

00:20:59.738 --> 00:21:01.448
Are you that worried?

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:06.745
You must be leaving home
for the first time, Ms. Oh.

00:21:07.454 --> 00:21:08.372
Yes.

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:12.209
Your siblings are grown up enough.

00:21:12.292 --> 00:21:14.336
They'll manage well without you.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.838
And I'm here too.

00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:21.968
Good night.

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.637
-Go to sleep.
-Okay.

00:21:40.487 --> 00:21:41.488
-That way?
-Yes.

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:46.284
Thailand!

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.163
-It's all right.
-Come take a look.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:56.253
Hello. You can take a look here.

00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:58.004
All pretty and nice.

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:02.676
Is this it? Is it the second floor here?

00:22:03.718 --> 00:22:05.387
Where is this guy?

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:08.098
Ma-jin! Go Ma-jin!

00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:12.644
-Hey, Ma-jin!
-Ma-yong!

00:22:12.727 --> 00:22:14.938
Hey, stay right there.

00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:18.984
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:22.487
Ma-yong!

00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:26.825
Goodness, my little cousin.

00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:29.661
It must've been one long trip.

00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:32.247
Goodness, Ma-yong.

00:22:33.248 --> 00:22:36.168
You've become quite friendly
while living abroad.

00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:39.504
I hope the leaf mustard kimchi
hasn't over-fermented.

00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:41.256
Goodness, what a shame.

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:45.594
Are you sure you brought everything
I told you to bring here?

00:22:45.677 --> 00:22:48.930
-I had to pay an extra $700 for it.
-Hello.

00:22:49.014 --> 00:22:50.557
-Hello.
-They were just too heavy!

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.474
Hello.

00:22:51.558 --> 00:22:53.143
How's your father doing?

00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.978
Now you want to know?

00:22:56.521 --> 00:23:00.317
Forget it. Come and meet
CEO Kang Tae-poong of our company.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.068
Hello, my name is Kang Tae-poong.

00:23:02.152 --> 00:23:04.905
I'm a former nominee of the 36th
and the 37th presidential elections

00:23:04.988 --> 00:23:06.698
of the Korean-Thai Association

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:09.701
and the CEO of Sawaddee Trading,
and my name's Go Ma-yong.

00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:12.954
-I see.
-You're one handsome man.

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:14.497
You're just like me!

00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:18.668
-And she is?
-Yes, hello.

00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:21.171
And as you can see, this is…

00:23:21.254 --> 00:23:22.797
Who is she?
Why aren't you introducing her?

00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:25.175
She's just one of our female staff.

00:23:26.218 --> 00:23:30.013
No, tell me. Who is she? What does she do?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.769
-Should we go?
-Yes.

00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:39.231
He says he even rented out
an office for us.

00:23:40.023 --> 00:23:44.277
You can't do your business
out on the streets.

00:23:44.361 --> 00:23:45.195
Thank you.

00:23:45.278 --> 00:23:47.530
That's enough with greetings
and formalities.

00:23:47.614 --> 00:23:49.449
It's right here.

00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:52.827
Come on in.

00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:53.912
This is it.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.961
Will this be our temporary office?

00:24:01.753 --> 00:24:04.130
-It's not this one, right?
-Of course not.

00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:07.300
Your office is just a part of the room,
just this area.

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:11.263
This? You expect the three of us
to sit on this tiny table and work?

00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:14.599
Were you going to sit here
instead of going out to work?

00:24:14.683 --> 00:24:16.434
That's why you're facing a crisis.

00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:19.229
How lazy are you?

00:24:20.063 --> 00:24:21.398
Let's see.

00:24:21.481 --> 00:24:22.899
Kasem!

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:28.071
-Chairs. Three chairs.
-Okay.

00:24:29.447 --> 00:24:33.702
I told you to bring old photos
that looked really ancient.

00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:37.622
-What about these? These are pretty old.
-This is a good one.

00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:41.751
You should put these ones out there.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:43.336
-I have this one too.
-That's good.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.255
It looks like you have tradition.

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:48.842
By any chance, do you have
a photo of anyone in a military uniform?

00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:51.011
It's nice to keep one out front.

00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:54.097
Soldiers have a lot of power in Thailand.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.433
These are nice.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.019
CELEBRATING THE DAY OF TRADE

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:01.813
Now, let's take a picture together.

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.273
TYPHOON TRADING UNITY EVENT

00:25:03.356 --> 00:25:05.567
Okay. I'll take a few,
so strike a nice pose.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.402
All right, then.

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:10.488
Okay, Mr. Kang.

00:25:10.572 --> 00:25:12.782
You're kind of awkward.
You seem down-to-earth.

00:25:12.866 --> 00:25:14.743
Act naturally. Let me take one first.

00:25:14.826 --> 00:25:17.787
Looking great. One, two, three.

00:25:18.872 --> 00:25:20.665
That's done. Any other pose?

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:23.251
That's good. "Typhoon Trading." Excellent.

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.961
One, two… I'll take one.

00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:27.213
That's a nice pose. One, two, three.

00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:29.674
Point your finger.

00:25:29.758 --> 00:25:31.760
Yes, but they aren't aligned. Focus.

00:25:31.843 --> 00:25:33.636
Ms. Mi-seon, what are you doing?

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.389
-You're covering Mr. Kang's eyes.
-I'm sorry.

00:25:36.473 --> 00:25:38.767
Excellent. Make the same eyes.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.435
Great pose. One, two, three.

00:25:41.311 --> 00:25:42.270
That was great.

00:25:42.354 --> 00:25:45.065
This time, look at the helmet. Good.

00:25:45.148 --> 00:25:46.983
Let's sell the helmets!

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:49.361
Okay. One, two, three!

00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:50.278
All done.

00:25:52.781 --> 00:25:54.240
This place is huge.

00:25:56.534 --> 00:25:57.660
Have you been here before?

00:25:57.744 --> 00:26:01.873
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:05.168
I'm hungry.

00:26:05.752 --> 00:26:07.087
This is delicious.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.089
Tom yum is here!

00:26:10.632 --> 00:26:12.592
This is great, Mama.

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.969
Enjoy your meal.

00:26:15.053 --> 00:26:16.763
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:26:16.846 --> 00:26:18.890
-Delicious. Try.
-Thank you.

00:26:20.517 --> 00:26:23.770
The lady of this guest house
is an excellent cook.

00:26:23.853 --> 00:26:27.607
She's the best when it comes to seasoning.
Everything is perfectly seasoned.

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.442
Looks delicious.

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.736
What are you doing, Ha-neul?

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.447
Come and say hello
to your uncle and the guests.

00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:36.366
Ha-neul, you punk!

00:26:36.908 --> 00:26:38.451
Come on out, kiddo.

00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.869
Hello.

00:26:40.662 --> 00:26:41.871
Hello.

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:43.039
Hey, son.

00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:44.874
Hey, Dad.

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:49.337
Jeez. What kind of nonsense
is he up to this time?

00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:08.648
-What's with the wink?
-He's not in a good headspace.

00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:09.774
Don't mind him.

00:27:15.572 --> 00:27:16.531
Come on.

00:27:19.617 --> 00:27:21.327
It tastes like makeup.

00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:23.788
Try it, Uncle. You're a man.

00:27:23.872 --> 00:27:26.040
Go and get your food.

00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:28.835
Leave that there.

00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.670
-Fine.
-Okay.

00:27:31.713 --> 00:27:32.547
Eat up.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.466
-What's this?
-Tom yum soup.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:36.759
-Thank you.
-Tom yum soup.

00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:39.262
-It's very delicious.
-That's what I'm saying.

00:27:39.345 --> 00:27:42.765
What's going on these days?
Men's and women's roles keep switching.

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:46.352
You can take this one.

00:27:49.063 --> 00:27:52.317
See? This tastes like makeup too.
These all taste the same.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.903
Anyway, everyone.

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:57.197
The country is in a mess.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.074
The power of our country
equals our power as expats,

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:04.829
but this IMF crisis is going to make
the Korean residents here starve.

00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:08.416
Only traders like myself
can barely make ends meet,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.418
thanks to my connections.

00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:12.295
Where do you make such connections?

00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:14.339
I moved here a long time ago

00:28:14.422 --> 00:28:17.550
and got to know people in high society
while teaching them taekwondo.

00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:19.969
I hear younger people
meet at clubs these days.

00:28:20.678 --> 00:28:23.223
You can go with my son one of these days.

00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:26.309
But the clubs in this neighborhood
are so luxurious

00:28:26.392 --> 00:28:28.436
that they only accept people

00:28:29.062 --> 00:28:31.731
who have lots of money
and have great looks.

00:28:31.814 --> 00:28:34.359
We have a great chance in that way.

00:28:34.442 --> 00:28:38.488
Mr. Kang was a proud member
of the Orange Tribe in Korea,

00:28:38.571 --> 00:28:41.991
so although he doesn't have much money,
he still has his looks left.

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:45.495
He always attracted people
whenever he went clubbing.

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.831
I'm not part of the Orange Tribe.

00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:49.707
And I quit clubbing.

00:28:50.917 --> 00:28:54.212
When you go there, you'll probably meet
Nihakham Group's chairman's daughter.

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.464
-Ha-neul is acquainted with her.
-Really?

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.884
When will the items arrive?

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:02.887
Was it called Lamchaya?

00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:05.598
This young lady here
sounds like a workaholic.

00:29:06.182 --> 00:29:09.018
I'm expecting a shipment,
so I'll go there tomorrow.

00:29:09.102 --> 00:29:12.146
-Do you want to tag along?
-Yes, I'd love to.

00:29:12.689 --> 00:29:17.527
Then can we go
and meet with the customs officer?

00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:19.362
Can we do that?

00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:22.574
Everything will go smoothly
once we get to know an officer.

00:29:22.657 --> 00:29:24.576
Yes, I'd like to see the port too.

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:29.873
Getting there isn't a problem,
but my car is already loaded.

00:29:29.956 --> 00:29:31.749
I don't think I can take all of you.

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:32.667
Who cares?

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.004
Mr. Kang and I will be going by ourselves,
so it doesn't matter.

00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:38.715
Hey, she brought this up first.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.592
Yes, I'll go.

00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:45.179
Why would you go there, Ms. Oh?

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.599
Take a hint.

00:29:47.682 --> 00:29:50.977
It's the CEO
and the salesman that should go.

00:29:53.646 --> 00:29:54.856
I work in sales too.

00:29:54.939 --> 00:29:57.108
Sure. So what?

00:29:58.651 --> 00:30:01.863
What can you do there?

00:30:02.697 --> 00:30:03.615
What will you do?

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:10.455
The three of us can
all squeeze in together.

00:30:10.538 --> 00:30:13.583
Or I can stick around here
and see if there's anything else to do.

00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:15.126
No, the CEO should go.

00:30:15.209 --> 00:30:19.172
And she keeps acting like this

00:30:20.089 --> 00:30:22.675
because you keep covering for her.

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:24.677
You shouldn't do this for her sake.

00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.515
-Come on--
-I'm sorry.

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:36.189
But I am not feeling well right now,
so please excuse me.

00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:37.482
Enjoy your dinner.

00:30:37.565 --> 00:30:39.317
-But we have so much good food.
-Ms. Oh.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.402
Go and get some rest.

00:30:44.822 --> 00:30:45.990
This was why.

00:30:46.908 --> 00:30:49.786
This was why I said
only you and I should've come.

00:30:50.954 --> 00:30:52.580
That useless girl came for no reason.

00:30:52.664 --> 00:30:55.375
-She only gets in our way--
-Mr. Go!

00:30:57.502 --> 00:30:59.963
You two are both salespersons.

00:31:00.046 --> 00:31:01.756
I didn't hire her.

00:31:02.966 --> 00:31:05.969
And do you realize
how important it is to appoint people?

00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:07.762
Wait, this is way too spicy.

00:31:09.222 --> 00:31:12.892
-Was this served to kill me?
-Why did you eat it?

00:31:16.062 --> 00:31:19.148
I mean, did I say something wrong?

00:31:34.706 --> 00:31:37.834
Eat this before you sleep.
You didn't get to eat earlier.

00:31:41.796 --> 00:31:42.797
Mr. Kang.

00:31:44.215 --> 00:31:45.842
I'll handle my own business.

00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:49.262
-What?
-You know…

00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:52.140
He says those things
because of how you act.

00:31:54.684 --> 00:31:56.853
What did I do?

00:31:56.936 --> 00:32:00.356
You keep treating me like this,
and it's honestly making me…

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.776
uncomfortable.

00:32:08.823 --> 00:32:09.657
Like what?

00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:13.453
Holding baggage and bringing food for you?

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.497
Even before this, you said--

00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:17.749
That I liked you?

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.422
I was just expressing my feelings.
I'm not expecting anything.

00:32:24.505 --> 00:32:26.132
Can't colleagues show each other

00:32:27.508 --> 00:32:29.427
this kind of consideration?

00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:33.806
If this feels uncomfortable,
that's just your insecurity.

00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:37.602
My insecurity?

00:32:37.685 --> 00:32:39.729
I've thought about it,
but I just don't get it.

00:32:42.607 --> 00:32:45.193
Do you think you're not good enough?

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:49.530
-Mr. Kang--
-You still need to eat.

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.659
It's from the lady of the guest house.

00:32:55.536 --> 00:32:56.370
Here.

00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:23.106
What is wrong with her?

00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:24.899
Good grief.

00:33:31.239 --> 00:33:32.323
Darn it.

00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:38.663
What's with you?

00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:41.457
Let's go. You're being immature.

00:33:43.334 --> 00:33:46.003
Man, she's really strong.

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:57.223
-Get out of my way. Jeez.
-Hey.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:01.102
Gosh.

00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:04.147
-There seems to be some tension today.
-Not at all.

00:34:05.106 --> 00:34:05.940
-Hop in.
-Okay.

00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:09.402
-You can get in first.
-Sure.

00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:12.446
Goodness.

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:46.689
All right. We're here!

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.200
-Should I carry this for you?
-No, I'm fine. I got it.

00:34:58.201 --> 00:35:01.245
-It's scorching hot here, isn't it?
-It's wonderful.

00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:06.125
The sky is very high.

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:07.877
The sky is high everywhere.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.004
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:35:24.185 --> 00:35:26.062
Where are these all from?

00:35:27.688 --> 00:35:29.941
My gosh. These are huge.

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:38.616
-Gosh.
-This is Lamchaya Port.

00:35:51.337 --> 00:35:55.007
You're so fussy.
Why are you taking photos?

00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:57.093
It's for the record.

00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:59.887
Focus on our business
instead of making records.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.266
She keeps doing these things
for no reason.

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:06.310
Stop bickering.
Let me take a photo of you three.

00:36:06.394 --> 00:36:08.187
This will be a good memory. Stand here.

00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:10.189
Memories, my foot.

00:36:10.273 --> 00:36:12.108
It's a hot day, so let's go.

00:36:12.191 --> 00:36:13.651
Let's take a picture to remember.

00:36:13.734 --> 00:36:16.904
Mr. Go, this way, please.
You can stand right here.

00:36:16.988 --> 00:36:19.657
I'll stand here
and take a great photo for you.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.492
-Like this.
-All right.

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:22.660
Here we go. Okay!

00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:25.621
I'll make sure you can see
the Lamchaya Port.

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:26.747
Here we go.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:30.334
Ma-jin and Ms. Oh, get in the picture.

00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:33.004
You aren't in the frame.

00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:36.757
You're not in the picture,
so try to be more enthusiastic.

00:36:37.883 --> 00:36:40.428
What are you doing, Ma-jin? Get in there.

00:36:40.511 --> 00:36:42.471
-Okay.
-You have to get closer to look good.

00:36:42.555 --> 00:36:44.890
-Come in here.
-Okay, then. Say kimchi!

00:36:44.974 --> 00:36:46.475
-I'll take one.
-Mustard leaf kimchi!

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:49.895
Ma-jin, this isn't a passport photo.
You look too rigid.

00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:52.023
I'll take one now. Okay.

00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:53.607
Wait, like this.

00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:56.819
-One, two…
-Kimchi!

00:36:56.902 --> 00:36:59.488
I'm not doing this.
I don't want to take this.

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:08.622
Why, that…

00:37:08.706 --> 00:37:10.249
That punk.

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.251
That car blocked everything.

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:14.170
I only got your feet, Ms. Oh.

00:37:14.253 --> 00:37:17.590
-Forget it. They're my best feature.
-What do you mean? Goodness.

00:37:18.924 --> 00:37:19.884
Feet?

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:26.349
Whatever. Mr. Kang, let's go.
I was only trying to make this better.

00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:31.187
This doesn't seem right.

00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:36.650
Will this end well?

00:37:41.197 --> 00:37:43.407
Mr. Go!

00:37:44.158 --> 00:37:47.244
I want to take a tour of the port
instead of the customs office.

00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:49.372
There's nothing to see there.

00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:51.040
Goodness gracious.

00:37:57.338 --> 00:37:59.965
I have to turn in some paperwork
to the customs office,

00:38:00.049 --> 00:38:01.425
so it'll take a bit of time.

00:38:01.509 --> 00:38:05.304
Arthit will come by later,
so you two should meet him.

00:38:05.388 --> 00:38:06.847
He's good at English.

00:38:07.932 --> 00:38:09.308
And yes, Ma-jin.

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:11.268
Did you prepare what I told you to?

00:38:11.352 --> 00:38:13.312
Of course, I came prepared.

00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:15.231
Okay, you can use those.

00:38:15.314 --> 00:38:19.235
Cigarettes here are way too strong,
so these are very popular.

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:20.152
He'll be happy.

00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:22.279
-Okay, then. I'll see you later.
-Sure.

00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:28.536
-Hello. I'm here to submit a document.
-Document submission is this way.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.666
Thank you.

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:35.501
-I'll get going.
-Yes, sure.

00:38:44.468 --> 00:38:47.763
-What are you doing?
-It's hard to tell, isn't it?

00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.849
What time is it now? It's 11:00 a.m.

00:38:49.932 --> 00:38:52.393
I'm sliding this in
to let him enjoy a good lunch.

00:38:52.476 --> 00:38:55.563
This is what I call
having a sharp knack for sales.

00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:58.566
You can't give him
both cigarettes and cash. That's bribing.

00:38:58.649 --> 00:39:01.235
-Give it back.
-Let go of this. Ms. Oh.

00:39:01.902 --> 00:39:03.237
Mr. Go.

00:39:04.572 --> 00:39:06.490
Just go all out casual
and call me by my name.

00:39:06.574 --> 00:39:08.784
Casual? You're way too old for that.

00:39:08.868 --> 00:39:11.162
At least leave the cash out.
What's with you?

00:39:11.245 --> 00:39:14.081
Look at you. What do you think sales is?

00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:16.250
It's winning our clients' hearts,

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.252
yet you haven't even won
your superior's heart.

00:39:18.335 --> 00:39:21.255
You should reflect on yourself
and figure out where you should be.

00:39:21.338 --> 00:39:22.506
Who are you?

00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:34.018
-Why? Why are you coming? Go over there.
-Pardon?

00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:35.686
There are lots of seats, so go.

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:06.300
All right?

00:40:13.933 --> 00:40:16.018
Where's Mr. Kang?
Why isn't he coming back?

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:23.067
What is it?

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.653
What pictures do you keep taking?

00:40:26.862 --> 00:40:30.115
Mr. Kang told me
to leave a record of everything,

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:31.867
and I have to write a report too.

00:40:31.951 --> 00:40:34.995
But keep it moderate.
Don't you know you're being impolite?

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:38.332
You look like a war correspondent.

00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:43.671
You have no idea what's important
and keep doing superficial things.

00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:47.091
This is exactly why I'm saying
you aren't salesperson material.

00:40:48.092 --> 00:40:49.009
Then what?

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:53.264
Is the sales process
sliding bribes in secret?

00:40:53.347 --> 00:40:55.391
Yes, that's it.

00:40:56.642 --> 00:40:59.061
Do you even know what sales is
when you say that?

00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:03.190
-What do you think is the basics of sales?
-I don't know.

00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:05.067
You never told me, so how would I know?

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.696
-What are the basics of sales, then?
-Why should I tell you?

00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:10.781
Who do you think you are?

00:41:12.324 --> 00:41:16.161
You've only traveled to Pusan a few times
and solved one incident.

00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:17.955
Do you suddenly feel important?

00:41:18.831 --> 00:41:22.835
Now, tell me.
Did you do that? Or was it Mr. Kang?

00:41:25.296 --> 00:41:27.756
You can't call that sales
if you didn't do it yourself.

00:41:28.591 --> 00:41:30.217
What you did would make you…

00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:32.052
We call that an assistant.

00:41:34.513 --> 00:41:35.598
Isn't that so, Oh?

00:41:46.734 --> 00:41:49.069
I got some beverages here.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.363
Have some.

00:41:51.447 --> 00:41:53.699
What's wrong?

00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:56.702
What's wrong?

00:41:58.954 --> 00:41:59.955
Ms. Oh, have some.

00:42:01.457 --> 00:42:02.458
It's grape flavor.

00:42:09.298 --> 00:42:10.382
Mr. Go!

00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:12.426
I found some beverages.

00:42:13.552 --> 00:42:15.220
Yes, let's go.

00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:19.224
Okay. Let's go.

00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:23.270
Goodness, here we go.

00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:37.534
SAWADDEE TRADING

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.918
Great work, everyone.

00:42:46.001 --> 00:42:48.003
You all should freshen up a little.

00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:51.382
And you'll all go to the club, right?

00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:54.677
No, you young people can go. I'll stay in.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.553
I don't need to go, either.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.514
Wait.

00:43:01.266 --> 00:43:04.603
This is a part of your job,
so be here on time.

00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:08.232
If not, you two can travel
by yourselves starting tomorrow.

00:43:11.902 --> 00:43:14.988
In that case, I'll come by
to pick you up later.

00:43:15.072 --> 00:43:16.907
-Okay. Thank you.
-All right. Thanks.

00:45:03.597 --> 00:45:05.807
Mr. Kang, you're all dressed up.

00:45:06.808 --> 00:45:10.395
Well, I feel more comfortable in this
than sweatsuits.

00:45:12.356 --> 00:45:14.691
-You look a bit--
-A bit awkward, right?

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:17.903
The lady gave this to me.

00:45:18.904 --> 00:45:21.740
-The shoes are uncomfortable too.
-No, it's not that.

00:45:27.871 --> 00:45:29.081
Did you drop something?

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:38.048
Is that mine?

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.350
All done.

00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:55.023
You definitely…

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:58.277
Definitely what?

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:16.128
It's not like
I don't know how to dress up.

00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:18.922
I've been there and done it all.

00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:34.563
Hello. Please come in.

00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:39.610
Hello.

00:47:05.427 --> 00:47:06.762
Over here, Mr. Kang.

00:47:09.222 --> 00:47:10.098
Come on down.

00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:13.935
Have a seat. You too, Ms. Oh.

00:47:14.978 --> 00:47:16.313
Sit over here, Ma-jin.

00:47:19.608 --> 00:47:21.943
And all the way in the back,

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:24.780
the girl in the classy black dress

00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:28.450
is the youngest daughter
of Nihakham Group's chairman.

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:31.787
Ha-neul, make sure you mention
Mr. Kang to her, okay?

00:47:45.842 --> 00:47:47.636
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:48:18.291 --> 00:48:21.294
-This club is banging.
-Isn't it?

00:48:21.837 --> 00:48:23.755
-What's this song?
-It'll be hard for you to pronounce.

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:25.424
"Pood eek tee dai rue plow."

00:48:25.507 --> 00:48:27.843
It means, "Let us meet just this once."

00:48:27.926 --> 00:48:30.053
-"Pood eek tee dai rue plow"?
-"Dai rue plow."

00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.763
So why aren't you dancing? Get up.

00:48:31.847 --> 00:48:33.598
-Go dance.
-Do you want to see my dance?

00:49:23.732 --> 00:49:25.567
-Is she serious?
-Go out there and sing.

00:52:01.306 --> 00:52:02.849
I feel like such a fool.

00:52:17.822 --> 00:52:20.742
What are you doing here?
I wasn't done with my song.

00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:24.287
I wanted a break. My feet hurt too much.

00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:25.830
Really?

00:52:27.791 --> 00:52:29.960
-Let me see it.
-No. Why? See what?

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.922
It's okay. What do you mean? I'm fine.

00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:36.967
-Even your feet are pretty.
-What?

00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:42.639
-I've been holding it in, but it came out.
-My gosh.

00:52:43.264 --> 00:52:44.307
One moment.

00:52:45.058 --> 00:52:47.560
-I'm okay, really.
-But I'm not okay.

00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:51.272
I'm fine.

00:52:51.356 --> 00:52:52.482
Your feet are chafed.

00:52:59.322 --> 00:53:00.365
Thank you.

00:53:04.327 --> 00:53:05.161
Okay.

00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:22.721
Is the work hard?

00:53:26.307 --> 00:53:27.142
No.

00:53:29.853 --> 00:53:31.521
I wouldn't say it's hard.

00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:37.152
I'm just wondering why I came here.

00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:42.949
I'm not doing anything.
I only wasted money on the flight.

00:53:49.497 --> 00:53:50.498
Ms. Oh.

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:52.667
I desperately wanted

00:53:54.335 --> 00:53:56.296
my father's approval.

00:53:57.047 --> 00:53:58.465
While I was growing flowers,

00:53:59.841 --> 00:54:05.597
I kept telling myself I'd show them to him
when they grow bigger and prettier.

00:54:06.639 --> 00:54:12.103
But the right timing doesn't come
just by sitting and waiting.

00:54:16.858 --> 00:54:20.570
But I'm sure
the late Mr. Kang already knew.

00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:24.199
Exactly.

00:54:27.827 --> 00:54:30.330
So don't try too hard. I already know you.

00:54:41.591 --> 00:54:42.592
Okay.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.306
Anyway,

00:54:48.389 --> 00:54:50.892
what were you going to say to me
back at the guest house?

00:54:51.476 --> 00:54:53.186
You tried to say something
after "definitely."

00:54:55.146 --> 00:54:56.815
I told you that you looked pretty.

00:54:58.316 --> 00:55:01.444
You definitely look pretty today.

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:10.620
-Do you always say people are pretty?
-No, I usually get that compliment.

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:15.708
Well, I don't know.

00:55:17.627 --> 00:55:21.548
I'm not sure if you're pretty,
but you're an excellent singer.

00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:23.007
How do you sing so well?

00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:25.343
-You think so?
-Yes.

00:55:26.052 --> 00:55:27.220
When did you leave?

00:55:39.232 --> 00:55:41.401
Yes, that part.

00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:29.782
EPISODE 8
THE BRIGHT DAYS OF YOUTH

00:56:53.139 --> 00:56:54.015
Nice.

00:56:58.478 --> 00:56:59.896
That hit the spot.

00:57:02.106 --> 00:57:04.692
I can't get used to the food here.

00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:09.739
SPICY TUNA

00:57:38.017 --> 00:57:39.310
Oh, right. I'm here alone.

00:59:02.477 --> 00:59:03.770
Do I look like him?

00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:07.357
I don't think so.

00:59:13.154 --> 00:59:13.988
What is this?

00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:16.741
Is that a gun?

00:59:16.824 --> 00:59:19.285
What has my dad been doing?

00:59:23.915 --> 00:59:25.083
Time for bed.

00:59:28.169 --> 00:59:29.462
What? Who are you?

00:59:29.545 --> 00:59:31.547
-Is he a Korean?
-Yes, he's a Korean.

00:59:31.631 --> 00:59:33.800
-Wait, who are you?
-Typhoon Company?

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.637
What's going on?

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.138
Who are you?

00:59:39.222 --> 00:59:40.515
Why are you arresting me?

00:59:41.683 --> 00:59:43.059
-Ms. Oh!
-What?

00:59:43.142 --> 00:59:44.936
Why?

00:59:45.019 --> 00:59:46.354
Mr. Kang.

00:59:53.611 --> 00:59:54.445
What?

00:59:54.529 --> 00:59:55.571
Okay, I'm coming.

00:59:58.241 --> 01:00:01.619
-What's going on? Hey!
-Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:03.371
Why are they doing this without a word?

01:00:03.454 --> 01:00:04.330
I'll handle this.

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:06.624
But why, Mr. Kang?
They won't tell us the reason.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.626
-Don't hold her too tightly.
-What's going on?

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.336
-Be gentle.
-Hey!

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.462
What is it?

01:00:11.546 --> 01:00:13.756
-Why are you doing this?
-Ms. Oh!

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.634
What are you doing?
Did we do something wrong?

01:00:16.718 --> 01:00:17.760
Wait a moment!

01:00:17.844 --> 01:00:19.387
-They attacked me!
-So why?

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:21.055
-What are you doing?
-Where are we going?

01:00:21.764 --> 01:00:24.058
-What is it?
-I didn't do anything!

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:25.518
What's going on?

01:00:28.354 --> 01:00:29.522
Be careful.

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:32.024
No, wait!

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:39.449
-Okay, fine!
-Where are you taking us?

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.993
-Where are you taking us?
-Okay, I get it.

01:00:51.836 --> 01:00:52.962
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

01:00:53.588 --> 01:00:55.131
-I'm fine.
-Are you?

01:00:55.214 --> 01:00:56.340
Obviously not.

01:00:56.424 --> 01:00:58.968
What's going on right now?

01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:02.972
Just be quiet.
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:06.100
How did you manage
to put on decent clothes?

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:09.854
You need to be in good clothes
especially in these times.

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:12.273
Stay alert no matter where you are.

01:01:13.232 --> 01:01:14.400
Watch what I do.

01:01:36.756 --> 01:01:39.133
-Pass… What?
-He wants your passport.

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:40.468
Passport. Right.

01:01:43.387 --> 01:01:47.892
No, it's not that.
First of all, why are we here?

01:01:56.025 --> 01:01:57.735
What are you saying? Okay.

01:02:01.739 --> 01:02:02.657
No!

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.950
Don't use it!

01:02:04.033 --> 01:02:06.536
No, don't do it. He said no.

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:09.455
I'm understanding some of the language.

01:02:09.539 --> 01:02:11.791
-You're so awesome.
-I'm glad I studied.

01:02:11.874 --> 01:02:16.003
What are you two doing right now?
You aren't here to take a test. Okay?

01:02:17.129 --> 01:02:20.049
You guys gave money to an officer.

01:02:20.132 --> 01:02:23.094
Giving money is bribery.

01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:26.764
Money? He's talking about money.

01:02:26.848 --> 01:02:29.141
Giving money…

01:02:29.225 --> 01:02:31.269
-Mr. Go!
-What? What is it?

01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:34.188
I think that's it. The $50.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:35.731
-Wait.
-What are we going to do?

01:02:35.815 --> 01:02:37.358
Stop talking nonsense.

01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.277
Why would the police do this over $50?

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.863
What is it? What about $50?

01:02:41.946 --> 01:02:43.489
It's not even a big deal.

01:02:43.573 --> 01:02:45.741
I gave an incentive
to the customs officer. No big deal.

01:02:45.825 --> 01:02:47.118
An incense?

01:02:47.201 --> 01:02:50.288
An incentive.
Incense? Incense is something you burn.

01:02:50.872 --> 01:02:51.956
It's fine.

01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:54.834
It was lunch, so I gave him
some lunch money.

01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:57.503
-It's nothing wrong.
-Just for lunch?

01:02:57.587 --> 01:03:00.548
No, he's a civil servant,
so it's considered bribing.

01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:03.009
Bribing? You can't do that!

01:03:03.092 --> 01:03:07.305
-Why didn't you stop him?
-I did, but he never listens to me.

01:03:07.388 --> 01:03:09.473
It really hurts
when you two are like this.

01:03:09.557 --> 01:03:12.143
I didn't do this just for my own good.

01:03:12.226 --> 01:03:13.102
It wasn't for my--

01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:14.395
Could you please be quiet?

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:15.396
Okay.

01:03:15.479 --> 01:03:16.314
Stupid ass!

01:03:16.397 --> 01:03:19.525
-He said, "Be quiet, idiots."
-Yes, Ms. Oh. Please stop.

01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:21.736
-Stop it.
-Okay. I just understood it.

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:27.658
He brought something.

01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:28.784
-Is that for us?
-Yes.

01:03:34.665 --> 01:03:37.668
Gosh, I don't think it looks like me.

01:03:37.752 --> 01:03:42.340
Who's that?
Mr. Kang, it looks a little bit like you.

01:03:43.507 --> 01:03:44.884
How does that look like me?

01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:47.178
I mean, in these times,
take responsibility

01:03:47.261 --> 01:03:49.305
and own up to this like the CEO you are.

01:03:49.388 --> 01:03:50.848
I have two children to raise.

01:03:52.808 --> 01:03:55.561
I am the boss, but wait.
This is your mistake.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.899
Is it this guy?

01:03:59.982 --> 01:04:01.651
No, it wasn't me.

01:04:01.734 --> 01:04:04.946
How is this me?
His eyes are smaller than the nostrils.

01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:07.657
-That's not me.
-You can't do that.

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.325
My pupils are huge.

01:04:09.408 --> 01:04:11.619
Your eyes are longer.

01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:14.872
Look at me, Ms. Oh.
They are sharp and long, yet big, right?

01:04:14.956 --> 01:04:16.666
Are they saying this is me?
It's so suspicious.

01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:17.792
Is it him?

01:04:17.875 --> 01:04:18.751
This is so not me.

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:19.794
Yes. Take him in custody!

01:04:19.877 --> 01:04:20.795
How is this me?

01:04:20.878 --> 01:04:21.754
It has to be you.

01:04:21.837 --> 01:04:24.131
-Wait, what are they doing?
-What?

01:04:24.215 --> 01:04:26.008
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

01:04:26.092 --> 01:04:28.010
-Let go of him!
-Don't take him!

01:04:28.094 --> 01:04:29.512
No, you can't take him!

01:04:31.555 --> 01:04:32.723
-Wait!
-Don't take him!

01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:35.101
Just me?

01:04:36.227 --> 01:04:37.311
Come back!

01:04:37.812 --> 01:04:39.021
What do we do?

01:04:47.238 --> 01:04:54.203
THE BRIGHT DAYS OF YOUTH

01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:30.448
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:33.534
It says you bribed $10,000, not $50.

01:05:33.617 --> 01:05:35.703
Wait, $10,000 equals over 15 million won.

01:05:35.786 --> 01:05:36.704
Mr. Kang!

01:05:36.787 --> 01:05:39.248
I saw it happen. This is not right.

01:05:39.331 --> 01:05:42.418
What about the meeting with Nihakham Group
as our potential client?

01:05:42.501 --> 01:05:45.629
This must be why
we haven't received your helmets.

01:05:45.713 --> 01:05:48.049
If you fail to explain,
they'll throw them out right away.

01:05:48.132 --> 01:05:49.341
They'll destroy them.

01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:51.886
Where did you get this jacket?

01:05:51.969 --> 01:05:53.429
What are the basics of being a CEO?

01:05:53.512 --> 01:05:56.057
What would my father tell me to protect?

01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.478
You're the coolest
and the prettiest person I have ever seen.

01:06:01.979 --> 01:06:06.984
