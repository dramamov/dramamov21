13:24.737 --> 13:26.573
- Non-lethal.

13:26.739 --> 13:27.674
I've seen it in action before.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.476
I know the signs.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.810
I was upwind,
but he got the brunt of it.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.179
The more time I spend here
explaining this,

13:32.312 --> 13:33.180
the worse he gets.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.581
I need a med kit.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.449
Um...um...

13:38.118 --> 13:39.452
[Owens] <i>Where?</i>

13:39.586 --> 13:40.620
The fridge.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.341
- Come on,
keep pounding it.

That's it, flush it out.

14:04.444 --> 14:09.549
[rapid beeping]

14:09.716 --> 14:10.650
We're fine here.
Go answer it.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.657
- [Reeves inhales sharply]
- It's okay.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.294
What are you waiting for?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.898
- [Anderson]
<i>I was only told three guests.</i>

[eerie music]

14:56.663 --> 14:57.597
[Reeves exhales]

14:59.232 --> 15:00.333
- There's a new walk-in coming.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.370
You were at City Hall?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.338
- Wait, where were you?
Were you at the motorcade?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.276
Yeah.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.083
I'm okay. Go.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.791
Hands in the air.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.560
Whoa, whoa.
Nope, nope,

15:27.727 --> 15:30.097
Don't move. Don't move.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
I'm Anderson.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.937
I'm the housekeeper here.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.373
- I just almost got my ass
blown apart.

Lower your gun.

15:44.444 --> 15:48.715
[tense music]

15:48.881 --> 15:50.383
I went through hell out there.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.252
We all did.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.954
Listen, I know we're all
as scared as you are.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.223
I am not scared.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.058
I'm dialed in.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.327
Anyone should be scared,
it's whoever just attacked us,

16:00.493 --> 16:02.762
and until I know exactly
who they are...

16:05.132 --> 16:06.733
and who you are...

16:08.468 --> 16:10.737
I'm keeping my gun up.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.176
Put the gun down.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.647
Put the gun down!

16:30.190 --> 16:31.758
Halton Langley.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.995
- Sorello, Homeland Security.
Show me your credentials.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.697
Lower your gun and I will.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.333
And since when is a revolver
standard at Homeland Security?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.669
- Nothing about today
has been standard.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.004
- Well, I'd like to finish
the day without getting shot.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.306
You?

[suspenseful music intensifies]

17:16.469 --> 17:18.905
Anderson. Housekeeping.

Who are our guests?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.210
Mia Owens, DoD.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.312
My partner, Reeves,
is injured.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.579
He's upstairs.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.718
Choi.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.922
I heard you were part
of the Mercury 2 detail.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.492
What is that?

17:40.693 --> 17:41.861
Vice president.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.236
- Just you running this house,
Anderson?

17:49.436 --> 17:52.372
- [Anderson] <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Tough job by yourself.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.942
I spent time in this space
back in the day.

17:56.109 --> 17:56.909
Do we have comms?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.044
[Anderson] <i>Secured.</i>

17:58.211 --> 17:59.846
- Yeah.
What about those windows?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.382
- They're one-way glass.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.454
- Like the kid said,
one-way glass.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.621
Bulletproof.

18:10.890 --> 18:11.958
What are you looking at? Huh?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.960
Hey. He's not our problem.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.465
[Sorello] <i>You running point.</i>

18:21.301 --> 18:22.902
I'm not even here, man.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.974
- All right.
I'm calling rank.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.410
- I need to get
to a secured phone line. Now.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.646
Follow me.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.984
- Halton.
I need to go check on Reeves.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.386
Let me look at him.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.418
For Marshall,
pass code 20112.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.323
<i>Agent Choi,</i>

19:17.324 --> 19:18.491
Any new intel?

<i>- Well, we have</i>
<i>two simultaneous attacks.</i>

19:21.194 --> 19:22.795
<i>Don't know the body count yet.</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:25.465
<i>The early estimates</i>
<i>could be in the hundreds.</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:27.634

19:33.373 --> 19:35.141
Are there any other agents
in the house?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.044
Yes.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.346
There's one from our unit.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.615
Two from Langley.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.183
One from DoD

19:44.351 --> 19:45.985
and some trigger-happy
son of a bitch from Homeland.

19:51.991 --> 19:52.959
- Don't tell any of them
what you have.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.527
We'll get a team to you soon.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.364
Stay strong, son.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.531
Yes, sir.

[Choi sighs]

[water splashing]

20:38.505 --> 20:39.606
He seems fine.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.042
Lucky it was CS, not sarin.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.945
How are you?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.015
A little better.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.518
I should have been
more diligent.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.587
- Hey.
No one saw this coming.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.461
Don't beat yourself up.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.564
Just follow protocol and we'll
get out of this safely.

21:04.731 --> 21:09.268

Romeo Romeo Five.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.216
You're on speaker.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.785
We currently have five guests
in the house.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.155
One agent's in recovery.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.423
- Housekeeper,
can you repeat?

21:30.557 --> 21:32.091
Did you say five guests?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.060
[Anderson] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

21:34.461 --> 21:35.728
- Agent Choi here.
Is there any intel on

21:35.895 --> 21:37.530
when the shelter in place order
will be lifted?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.399
- [Marshall] <i>All agents are</i>
<i>to follow protocol.</i>

21:40.232 --> 21:41.401
Everyone?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.670
- All agents are
to follow protocol.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.741
Command, this is Halton.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.610
I'm running point.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.779
Is there any indication
when the order will be lifted?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.414
[Marshall] <i>No, none.</i>

21:54.614 --> 21:57.417

- So you're saying
we're stuck here.

22:01.788 --> 22:02.589
[Marshall] <i>That's affirmative.</i>

22:02.755 --> 22:03.856
That's fucking great.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.258
- Halton,
can you pick up the handset?

22:06.426 --> 22:08.127
We have new intel
we need to discuss.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.643
I'm here.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.858
Can you say that again?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.192

Hello?

System override.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.734
It's a remote lockdown.

They're locking us in here.

[Sorello] <i>Fuck. Go.</i>

<i>Pull. Pull.</i>

22:54.741 --> 22:55.875
[both straining]

22:56.008 --> 22:57.143
They cut the power.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.310
The door's locked.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.345
There's no way in or out.

- [Sorello] <i>Shit.</i>

23:02.181 --> 23:03.349
What did he say?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.820
What did he say?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
- How do we lose power if some
of these lights are still up?

23:17.564 --> 23:18.898
Battery backups.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.833
Doesn't take much
to power a bulb.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.401
- Any other exits?
- It's a safe house.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.203
How many exits you think
it's gonna have?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.507
[disconnected beeping]

23:27.707 --> 23:28.841
[Owens] <i>There's no signal.</i>

23:29.008 --> 23:29.576
They jammed it.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.112
Fucking protocol.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.547
- It's like they think
we're the enemy.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.255
They think we're the enemy.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.591
What the fuck does that mean?

23:46.192 --> 23:47.694
- Command traced
the detonator signal

23:47.860 --> 23:49.562
from today's attacks to here.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.233
They think one of us
is the bomber.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.704
Wait, wait.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.172
Why would the bomber
keep the detonator on them?

24:00.306 --> 24:02.709
To set off the next bomb.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.311
- [Halton] <i>We're all detained</i>
<i>until one of us surrenders.</i>

24:05.478 --> 24:07.246
You believe that?

24:07.413 --> 24:08.815
They traced the signal here.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.821
Well, I was shot at.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.155
Yeah, so were we.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.323
I've been here the whole time.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.591
You can--
you can check the cameras.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.426
- That's pretty convenient
for you, ain't it?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.962
The power's out,
so we can't check them, can we?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.497
- I'm just putting my cards
on the table, too.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.499
- And maybe that's something
we should all do.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.735
What the fuck were you
on the line about?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.903
- No,
that's above your pay grade.

24:31.070 --> 24:31.971
You're hiding something.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.340
That's my business, not yours.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.012
- Look, they said
the detonator is still here.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.280
I mean, we can search the place,
right?

24:41.447 --> 24:42.448
- Detonator could be the size
of a dime.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.350
- Yeah,
and where does that leave us?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.085
[Choi] I don't know.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.119
You want to start
shooting folks?

24:47.286 --> 24:49.288
- Start with him.
- Oh.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.423
No, you do not want to be
pushing my buttons right now.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.492
You are hiding something,

24:53.660 --> 24:56.362
and we deserve to know
what it is before we get killed.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.298
- Trust me, if I was the enemy,
you would all be dead by now.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.268
I miss anything?

[Halton] <i>Choi.</i>

25:56.422 --> 26:01.060
[helicopters rotors whirring]

26:04.697 --> 26:05.898
- [Owens]
<i>Your pupils look better.</i>

26:09.068 --> 26:12.571
Ahh. Yeah.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.240
Everything's still blurry,
though.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.780
Look, this is nuts.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.449
We're under a shelter in
place order from a WMD thread.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.817
We've got no power.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.018
Yeah, we're screwed here.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.690
What do you remember?

26:32.391 --> 26:35.261
I remember waking up.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.764
<i>And both of us being nervous</i>
<i>about this assignment.</i>

26:43.803 --> 26:45.404
<i>The quiet ride to Mercury 2.</i>

26:48.941 --> 26:50.176
<i>And then I remember you</i>
<i>taking a phone call</i>

26:50.376 --> 26:50.943
<i>and splitting away</i>
<i>from the group.</i>

26:51.143 --> 26:53.379
<i>And then...</i>

26:53.412 --> 26:55.481
<i>I turned around and gas</i>
<i>was just spraying everywhere.</i>

26:55.614 --> 26:58.184
[rapid gunfire]

26:58.384 --> 26:59.819
<i>Then everything else</i>
<i>is just a blur.</i>

27:01.153 --> 27:02.421
<i>But I remember your voice.</i>

27:04.456 --> 27:06.693
- [Owens] <i>Come on, Reeves.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

27:06.893 --> 27:08.060
<i>I got you.</i>

27:14.300 --> 27:16.502
[Reeves grunting]

27:16.635 --> 27:18.004
And then we were here.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.645
I could have lost you.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.080
Hey, I'm alive.

27:30.449 --> 27:34.420
I'm here, and you're here.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.157
You still a fighter?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.194
Always.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.662
You still got it?

27:43.796 --> 27:45.765
- Hey. Halton wanted me to tell--

27:49.135 --> 27:50.169
Yeah.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.474
Yeah. I kept it safe.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.346
- Okay. That was
a targeted attack,

28:01.647 --> 28:02.348
which means they must have known
why we were there.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.750
It was classified.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.818
- [Reeves]
<i>We gotta tell the others.</i>

28:05.952 --> 28:07.619
No.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.123
- Hey. Hey.
I know it's dangerous.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.491
Are you sure?

28:15.127 --> 28:19.966
[sighs] No. Not at all.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.667
But if we are being hunted,

28:22.068 --> 28:23.502
then we're gonna need allies
in the room.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.309
God forbid this gets any worse.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.380
We both nearly died today.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.547
Me too.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.516
- I know we're all
under suspicion.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.188
This is my first time back
in the field after three years.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.226
I work in development,

28:47.393 --> 28:49.661
at the Department of Defense
Special Projects.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.097
<i>The what?</i>

28:51.230 --> 28:53.432
It's the DoD creative arm.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.401
- I'm a developer,
and Reeves

28:55.567 --> 28:56.869
is my associate
in the Secret Service.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.906
So you're Q and he's Bond.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.240
- We've been working together
for the past nine months

29:01.407 --> 29:03.943
on a new assignment.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.846
We were here in Los Angeles
to deliver it to Mercury 2.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.714
- [Choi] <i>That's why you were</i>
<i>outside City Hall?</i>

29:17.857 --> 29:19.391
- We were to deliver
special project

29:19.558 --> 29:21.493
code name C49.

29:21.627 --> 29:22.895
The case got damaged.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.798
- What is that?
A monocular?

29:25.965 --> 29:29.435
- This one can only be
activated by my ID.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.736
One of my eyes.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.573
We were to deliver it today
to the Mercury 2.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.210
To lock it to him.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.980
- It's got a built-in fail-safe
in case the subject dies too.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.715
- If I were dead,
this device would recognize

29:43.883 --> 29:46.285
that my pupils were mid-dilated.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.320
Cadaveric position.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.222
- So it's a device
that protects itself,

29:50.389 --> 29:52.424
but not the user.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.926
What the hell does it do?

29:54.093 --> 29:55.661
- We're not authorized--
- Bullshit. What the hell--

29:55.995 --> 29:58.630
- We're not authorized
to reveal that.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.567
But if this is
what they're after,

30:02.935 --> 30:04.470
we're gonna need your help
to keep it safe.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.173
- This device stays
between me and Reeves

30:07.306 --> 30:08.240
and no one else.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.608
[Reeves coughs]

30:16.748 --> 30:17.649
<i></i> [Owens] <i>That went well.</i>

30:18.017 --> 30:19.451
We had to withhold some things.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.288
That's the business.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.090
We told them enough
to get them off our backs.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.293
(coughs) Yeah.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.496
I'm okay.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.998
Go keep an eye on them,

30:32.498 --> 30:34.466
especially that prick
from Homeland.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.434
[sniggers]

30:35.534 --> 30:37.937
[water pouring]

30:48.314 --> 30:50.516
- It's time for you
to level with me.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.485
- Listen,
I appreciate our past.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.487
- I do.
- Appreciate it?

30:55.621 --> 30:57.856
You need to remember it.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.359
I ran the Moscow corridor
when you were still pretty new.

31:00.726 --> 31:04.196
I extracted a Soviet asset
to this same safe house.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.032
Everyone's day is going to get
a lot more complicated

31:06.198 --> 31:07.866
if we don't work together.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.269
Do you have a question, Halton?

31:10.469 --> 31:12.838
- Choi, if I were you,
I would not make me the enemy.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.006
You're going to get us
all killed.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.674
I'm trying to save you all.

31:15.841 --> 31:16.742
God damn it, Choi.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.876
What's the problem?

31:20.146 --> 31:22.048
He finally tell you he's working
with the North Koreans?

31:22.214 --> 31:23.549
Yeah.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.417
- I'm Chinese American,
you fucking idiot.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.752
- Doesn't make me feel
any better.

31:26.919 --> 31:27.920
Hey, come on, Sorello.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.521
No, it's fine.

31:29.688 --> 31:30.489
You want to do this?
We could do this.

31:30.656 --> 31:31.323
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Yeah?

31:31.490 --> 31:33.059
You paranoid fuck.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.694
In this house, you are the
bottom of the food chain.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.496
Nobody here knows
who the fuck you are,

31:37.663 --> 31:38.764
- why you're here,
- I have every right to know

31:38.931 --> 31:39.698
- You could be some--
- what's going on here.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.267
In fact, it's my job to know.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.569
And if you think for one second
that I'm gonna wait

31:43.735 --> 31:45.837
until someone shoots me
in the back of the fucking head

31:46.005 --> 31:47.573
over whatever it is
that you're keeping secret,

31:47.739 --> 31:49.108
you got another think coming.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.343
- I can guarantee you,
no one will shoot you

31:51.377 --> 31:52.344
in the back of the head.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.348
- This isn't the time
to be holding back intel.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.384
- It's not the time
to be sharing intel either.

31:58.550 --> 31:59.818
I gave you your
one warning earlier.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.087
- [Sorello]
<i>And this is your warning.</i>

32:01.287 --> 32:02.154
- [Choi] <i>Yeah?</i>
- Guys.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.255
Come clean now.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.356
There's someone at the window!

32:04.523 --> 32:06.959
[loud explosion]

32:07.126 --> 32:10.429
[tense music]

32:10.596 --> 32:13.532
[rapid gunfire]

32:19.805 --> 32:20.572
- [Gunman Six] <i>Cover.</i>
- [Gunman Seven] <i>Go!</i>

32:23.642 --> 32:25.011
[glass shatters]

32:25.044 --> 32:25.911
[Choi] <i>Shit.</i>

32:51.503 --> 32:52.171
[Reeves] <i>Owens, move!</i>

32:55.574 --> 33:00.312
[overlapping grunting]

33:15.261 --> 33:19.798
[intense music]

33:28.474 --> 33:29.475
[Choi] <i>No, no.</i>

33:32.644 --> 33:34.012
Bridge, bridge.

33:41.387 --> 33:42.188
[glass shatters]

33:47.493 --> 33:48.660
[knife clanking]

34:14.920 --> 34:16.755
[Gunman choking]

34:19.691 --> 34:20.659

[high-pitched ringing]

34:58.964 --> 35:00.866

35:08.740 --> 35:09.908
Mag.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.586
[Reeves] <i>Get down.</i>

35:21.920 --> 35:22.721
- [Reeves] <i>[Indistinct],</i>
<i>watch out.</i>

35:28.126 --> 35:29.995
Reeves. Reeves.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.265
Come on.

35:33.399 --> 35:34.466
No, no, look at me.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.070
Look at me, please.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.873
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

35:42.007 --> 35:42.774
Come on.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.078
Oh, my...come on.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.414
Don't leave me.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.081
Please.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.124
Clear.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.526
[rapid gunfire]

36:03.595 --> 36:05.163
[gunman screaming]

36:05.331 --> 36:06.798
[crash]

36:07.833 --> 36:08.967
Now we're clear.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.237
[loud explosion]

36:11.270 --> 36:12.671
Oh.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.139
What the hell was that?

36:19.611 --> 36:25.016
[pensive music]

36:25.183 --> 36:26.952
- Can we get a sheet
for him or something?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.167
[Choi] <i>The ropes are gone.</i>

36:42.368 --> 36:43.402
<i>That's how they got away.</i>

36:46.238 --> 36:49.475
Hey. In here.

36:51.009 --> 36:54.846
- Oh, come on.
How did this happen?

36:56.214 --> 36:58.116
- [Halton] <i>I shot the guy</i>
<i>in the head.</i>

36:58.350 --> 36:59.718
<i>He must have blown up.</i>

36:59.918 --> 37:01.219
- [Sorello] <i>The guy that Choi</i>
<i>chucked out the window,</i>

37:01.387 --> 37:03.054
<i>he exploded too.</i>

37:03.255 --> 37:05.223
- [Anderson]
<i>And the other one escaped.</i>

37:05.391 --> 37:09.928
[pensive music]

37:24.910 --> 37:25.877
[Garcia] <i>RPG! Watch out.</i>

37:35.354 --> 37:36.121
[Garcia] <i>Exit fire!</i>

37:36.254 --> 37:37.856
[Owens] <i>Context right.</i>

37:38.056 --> 37:39.658
[Garcia] <i>Move it. Move it.</i>

37:39.858 --> 37:40.626
<i>Cover me.</i>

37:57.643 --> 38:03.549
[Owens crying]

38:30.442 --> 38:31.577
<i>- You know what</i>
<i>I'm trying to figure out?</i>

38:31.777 --> 38:33.211
<i>If one of us is the bomber,</i>

38:33.412 --> 38:34.813
<i>then why were we just attacked?</i>

38:38.316 --> 38:40.051
How is that thing still on?

38:40.185 --> 38:41.753
It's got a backup battery.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.322
- Lot of medicine inside.
Keeps it fresh.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.458
- Medicine?
You got quick clot in here?

38:46.625 --> 38:47.759
[Anderson] <i>Yeah.</i>

38:47.959 --> 38:49.327
<i>The left-hand side.</i>

39:02.307 --> 39:03.308
- I thought these windows
were bulletproof.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.045
- Bulletproof,
not explosive proof.

39:09.615 --> 39:10.782
Never seen the street so empty.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.253
- Yeah, that's what happens
when you evacuate a city.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.989
- [Announcer] <i>Downtown</i>
<i>Los Angeles has been evacuated.</i>

39:19.625 --> 39:24.295
[helicopter whirring]

39:24.496 --> 39:26.331
- [Announcer] <i>[indistinct]</i>
<i>Downtown jurisdiction.</i>

39:26.532 --> 39:27.666
<i>- [News Anchor]</i>
<i>By order of the governor,</i>

39:27.866 --> 39:29.768
<i>martial law has been declared</i>

39:29.968 --> 39:32.771

<i>With risk of any</i>

39:47.819 --> 39:52.591
[somber music]

39:55.594 --> 39:57.028
- Are you sure you want
to do that?

39:57.195 --> 39:59.431
- He hasn't blown up yet.
I reckon we'll be fine.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.210
BOOM!

40:14.212 --> 40:15.947
They don't even bother
hiding their faces.

40:16.114 --> 40:16.915
- When you're wearing
a dead trigger,

40:17.082 --> 40:18.450
it doesn't matter who sees you.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.685
Anyone recognize him?

40:19.851 --> 40:20.786
He's dead.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.021
Why did he not explode?

40:23.221 --> 40:24.790
- [Halton] <i>The trigger mechanism</i>
<i>is toast.</i>

40:24.890 --> 40:27.058
- This is some
guerrilla warfare shit.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.827
The moment his heart stops,
boom.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.061
Anything on him?

40:33.799 --> 40:35.266
He's clean.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.769
Minus, of course,
the block of C4 up his ass.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.104
- You see anything
on that tablet?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.577
- I don't remember.
It all happened so fast, and...

40:45.744 --> 40:47.979
- You work in development,
and the best you've got is,

40:48.146 --> 40:49.648
"I don't know,
it all happened so--"

40:49.815 --> 40:51.717
- There were explosions,
so forgive me

40:51.883 --> 40:53.652
if I'm a little fuzzy
on the details.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.587
- Those details
got your partner killed.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.088
Fuck you, Choi!

40:57.255 --> 40:58.890
I'm not the one
holding back intel.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.692
They seem more interested
in you.

41:00.826 --> 41:01.593
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

41:01.727 --> 41:02.961
Don't!

41:03.128 --> 41:04.930
You don't want to do that.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.232
- Just let her go, man.
- Stay out of this.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.735
- Okay.
I'm just saying,

41:09.901 --> 41:11.202
that the only way
we're gonna get through this

41:11.336 --> 41:12.838
is if we work together.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.075
- One more fucking move,
I dare you.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.409
- I fucking--
- Choi, let him up!

41:18.577 --> 41:19.845
- dare you.
- [gunshot]

41:22.113 --> 41:26.251
- That was my last warning
to everyone here.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.129
[Anderson winces]

41:38.296 --> 41:39.197
Don't be such a pussy.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.366
- I'm not.
- Well, let me finish.

41:49.608 --> 41:53.144
- I'm sorry...
about your partner.

41:59.317 --> 42:01.152
- [Owens] <i>I wish</i>
<i>I could have done more.</i>

42:06.357 --> 42:07.993
- Is that the first time
you lost someone?

42:11.563 --> 42:14.933
- I served a tour in Iraq
before I joined the DoD.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.735
Put my degree to use.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.337
You serve too?

42:20.371 --> 42:21.472
The Marines.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.677
- How the hell did you
get away with that?

42:27.545 --> 42:28.379
Don't ask.

42:29.848 --> 42:30.716
Rangers.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.184
No shit.

42:33.351 --> 42:34.753
For a while, anyway.

42:34.920 --> 42:39.390
I was in Iraq, and my platoon
was hit with an IED.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.761
Same old crap.
You've heard it before.

42:45.864 --> 42:46.732
Tell me.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.370
- Well,
our convoy was blown to shit,

42:53.839 --> 42:55.406
and my second gunner,

42:56.942 --> 42:58.409
Garcia,

42:58.576 --> 43:00.011
I see him out the window
of the Humvee,

43:00.178 --> 43:02.347
and he's what,
100 yards away,

43:02.748 --> 43:04.449
and he's down.

43:04.616 --> 43:05.917
So I left the convoy,

43:07.686 --> 43:10.021
and I almost get to Garcia,

43:12.724 --> 43:16.427
and then suddenly I feel this
burning in the side of my--

43:16.895 --> 43:17.729
You all right?

43:20.065 --> 43:21.933
I blacked out.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.435
I thought I was dead.

43:26.805 --> 43:29.374
A passing convoy
came by and saved us.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.279
God, I couldn't save him.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.450
You can't save everyone.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.625
I lost my sister,
too.

43:47.759 --> 43:51.596
[somber music]

44:01.072 --> 44:04.843
- When I came back,
I had the usual. Nightmares...

44:05.010 --> 44:09.280
shortness of breath...
the thoughts...

44:09.447 --> 44:11.082
Then I started working
in development tech

44:11.249 --> 44:14.285
and I found a way
to busy my mind.

44:14.419 --> 44:15.253
Busy my...

44:15.353 --> 44:17.789
You found a new passion.

44:17.956 --> 44:20.125
- I found something
where I could save lives,

44:24.295 --> 44:25.663
even my own.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.833
[loud alarm blaring]

44:28.033 --> 44:29.134
- [Owens]
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

44:29.167 --> 44:30.268

44:42.380 --> 44:44.115
[Sorello] <i>Oh, shit.</i>

44:44.282 --> 44:45.784
Okay, they must've hacked
into the system.

44:45.984 --> 44:46.852
[Halton] <i>Why?</i>

44:47.052 --> 44:48.019
<i>What does that accomplish?</i>

44:48.186 --> 44:49.520
- Corner us to force us
to move.

44:49.687 --> 44:50.889
I mean, look at where we are.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.591
- We're fish in a...
- Barrel.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.326
[explosion]

44:55.526 --> 44:57.062
[Sorello] <i>What is that?</i>

44:57.195 --> 44:58.964
[tense music]

44:59.164 --> 44:59.831
[Halton] <i>Get back.</i>

45:10.308 --> 45:11.342
[Owens] <i>Storage room.</i>

45:11.509 --> 45:12.944
It's screener smoke.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.245
- Gotta move.
Cover your mouth.

45:17.415 --> 45:18.850
[Choi] <i>Owens, come on.</i>

45:19.050 --> 45:20.618
- [Owens] <i>Cover the door</i> .
- [Choi] <i>Let's go.</i>

45:20.718 --> 45:22.153
I'll take the right flank.

45:49.214 --> 45:50.215
Anderson, wait.

46:22.547 --> 46:23.114
<i>Got you.</i>

46:30.388 --> 46:34.059

[metal clanking]

47:35.653 --> 47:36.988
He's alive.

47:38.489 --> 47:39.690
Any explosives?

47:48.333 --> 47:49.334
[Anderson] <i>All clear.</i>

47:50.235 --> 47:51.402
Cuff him.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.141
[Halton] <i>Let's check the place.</i>

47:56.341 --> 47:57.775
<i>They might still be here.</i>

47:58.009 --> 47:58.809
You okay?

48:01.479 --> 48:02.680
Yeah.

48:10.521 --> 48:11.656

[Sorello gasps]

Where the fuck did they go?

49:26.164 --> 49:27.232
[Halton] <i>In here.</i>

49:44.749 --> 49:45.783
[Choi] <i>Shit.</i>

49:45.950 --> 49:47.352
Give you a boost?

49:51.622 --> 49:52.823
I'll go.

49:53.758 --> 49:54.825
Hold this.

50:06.637 --> 50:07.838
Be careful.

50:17.648 --> 50:22.187
[Owens panting]

50:24.822 --> 50:26.457
Jesus, it's a trap.

50:34.499 --> 50:36.467
It's enough Semtex to bring
down the whole building.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.971
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon.

50:41.139 --> 50:44.075
- Anderson, how the fuck
could you not hear

50:44.242 --> 50:45.276
something happening
right above your head?

50:45.410 --> 50:47.044
Huh?

50:47.212 --> 50:49.880
That's your job,
to keep this place secure.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.923
Exactly what is your job,
Sorello?

50:59.090 --> 51:00.558
You still haven't told us
why you're even here.

51:00.725 --> 51:02.827
Homeland Security.

51:02.993 --> 51:05.696
It's my job to make sure
that there's no terror threats

51:05.863 --> 51:07.732
on public transportation.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.700
Oh well, that sure worked out
for everyone.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.273
- The only one that knows
anything is this asshole.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.074
Let's wake him up
and get some answers.

51:17.242 --> 51:19.577
- I want an agent posted
at the window.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.112
Sorello, you're up.

51:21.279 --> 51:22.713
Why me?

51:22.913 --> 51:24.749
Because you're the only one
who will shoot first

51:24.915 --> 51:26.217
and ask questions later.

51:39.730 --> 51:44.735
[rhythmic, unsettling music]

51:45.736 --> 51:46.571
Accelerant.

51:56.747 --> 52:00.385
Don't worry. I'm only gonna
give him a couple of ccs.

52:03.087 --> 52:04.489
More than enough
to make him talk.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.104
What the fuck, Sorello?

52:20.305 --> 52:22.139
[Sorello] <i>What?</i>

52:22.173 --> 52:24.209
- Anderson,
you get on the windows.

52:24.242 --> 52:26.076
Sorello, stay in here
until he wakes up.

52:26.244 --> 52:27.578
- What am I,
a babysitter now?

52:29.280 --> 52:30.315
- It's gonna be about five
to 10 minutes.

52:30.481 --> 52:31.649
Good.

52:31.816 --> 52:33.351
I want to speak to him first.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.211
- Hey, Halton,
this backup battery pack here.

53:00.378 --> 53:01.312
I can remove it, right?

53:02.713 --> 53:03.848
I guess so.

53:05.616 --> 53:07.051
- I think I can hook it up
to the electrical system

53:07.184 --> 53:08.152
in the supply room.

53:09.854 --> 53:12.457
Great idea, Owens.

53:12.623 --> 53:14.058
I'll see what I can do.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.033
- You know what?
My blood sugar's sinking.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.202
Let me get some
of this pizza right here.

53:31.642 --> 53:33.911
- It's a shame that bullet
just nicked him.

53:34.078 --> 53:35.246
Can't believe you right now.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.248
- What? You want to order
DoorDash or somethin'?

53:37.415 --> 53:38.716
Tell him to look for the guy
on the sidewalk

53:38.883 --> 53:39.817
without a torso.

53:48.259 --> 53:53.063
[tense music]

54:11.248 --> 54:12.617

of electrical engineering

54:12.783 --> 54:14.251

You don't understand English?

55:02.767 --> 55:04.502
Hm?

Can you speak?

55:31.696 --> 55:33.364
Can you speak?!

55:35.866 --> 55:38.168
Maybe you'll talk a little
easier with fewer teeth.

Are you just gonna let
this happen?

What's the American phrase?

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:15.746
Ah, yeah.
You're fish in barrel.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.882
[laughing]

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:26.657
Even you,
Mia Angelica Owens.

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:27.792
Thirty-two.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:29.126
Weapon specialist,

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:32.162
having fling with her partner,
Daniel Reeves.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:37.668
Spent nine months on this case
only to watch your lover die.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:43.908
[screaming]

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:44.909
Kill him.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:52.149
You won't tell me? Fine.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:56.620
How about I give you
the full fucking dose?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.488
What are you planning?!

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:00.524
[laughs] Planning.

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:02.927
[laughs]

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.928
Tell me!

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:07.865
- Poor girl,
it's already in motion.

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:10.167
You'll be with your lover
real soon.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:11.802
Motherfucker!

01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:13.170
This isn't about you.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:14.839
This isn't about you!

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.106
Owens!

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:19.543
You don't need to do this.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:21.979
You don't need to do this.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.418
You can't save anyone.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.187
It's cyanide. It's cyanide!

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.823
It's cyanide. It's cyanide!

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.825
You're already dead.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.126
What are you doing? Huh?

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:37.061
He was gonna talk.

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:38.128
- [stammers] I was--

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:39.529
[Halton] <i>He was talking.</i>

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.831
- [Anderson]
Just trying to help.

01:01:40.965 --> 01:01:42.399
Trying to help?

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:46.270
[bomb beeping]

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:47.838
<i></i> [Owens] <i>Sorello, check him.</i>

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:51.842
<i>Holy shit. It's armed.</i>

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:53.377
Anderson, you searched him.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.644
- I must have been
moving too fast.

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.146
Everybody out! Now!

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:58.448
[explosion]

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.384
[all groan]

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:08.392
[electricity crackles]

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.894
[glass shatters]

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.098
[all groaning]

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.400
Okay. Okay.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.002
I know what's going on here.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.106
I figured it out.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:24.608
I know who is working with them.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:29.679
[gun clicks]

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.582
- Pu--put that away.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.751
- Why would you run in there
just before she got him?

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:36.120
She was gonna kill him.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.621
- No,
he was about to sing.

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:39.256
- You don't--you don't know that.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:40.690
You don't know
what she was gonna do.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:42.426
- You. You're the one
that searched his body.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.794
All the other bodies blew up.

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:45.863
- You weren't supposed to be
in that room.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:49.566
And you, the one that's all
calm, clear-headed, and quiet,

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:52.702
didn't hear what was going on
right above your fucking head.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.138
[gun clicks]

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:56.140
Answer the question.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.541
Are you kidding me?

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.575
We haven't heard a peep
from them

01:02:58.742 --> 01:02:59.910
since they've been up there.

01:03:00.044 --> 01:03:01.778
None of us have.

01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:04.214
The Russian, he had you dead
to rights in that snow cloud,

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:05.883
and I saved you.

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.417
You would be dead
if it wasn't for me.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.552
That fucker stabbed me
in the shoulder,

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.320
and you still don't trust me?

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:11.521
[gun clicks]

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.990
[Halton] <i>Sorello, wait.</i>

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.560
- [Sorello] <i>I can't believe</i>
<i>it took me this long</i>

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.495
<i>to figure all of this out.</i>

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.799
<i>- You're a fucking traitor.</i>
- [gun clicks]

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.168
Look.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.838
My name is Nathan Anderson.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:30.340
I gave the warning that
they were outside the window.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.476
I saved all of your lives.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:36.480
But every--everyone thinks
that--that I'm the throwaway?

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.582
I'm the mistake?

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.317
That's what happens, right?

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.519
When you're a vet,
you just make some mistakes.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.157
You're so eager to shoot
someone today?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.626
Shoot me, motherfucker.

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:51.261
Shoot me!

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:56.633
- We're going to
start establishing

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.768
some goddamn order here.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.371
- First, Sorello,
you're going to keep your gun

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.107
out of our faces.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.547
Second, Owens,
take Anderson's gun.

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:13.850
Take him upstairs
and cuff him.

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:20.524
[Sorello sighs]

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.897
- You don't have to do this,
you know.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.202
We both lost people
in the war.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:36.406
I just couldn't handle it
as well as you.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:37.741
Don't make this about me.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.143
It's not.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:42.179
It's about them.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.150
They die, but...

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.753
they stay with us.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.190
Their faces, their voices...

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.594
their last words.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.199
They all stay with us.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.040
It's up to us to do better...

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:12.576
for them.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:22.552
Sorello was right.

01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:26.623
I nearly broke him.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:53.383
- Choi. These terrorists,
or whoever they are,

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.254
know more about us than we do.
And all we know about them

01:05:57.421 --> 01:06:00.790
is they're smuggling
fucking bombs on their backs.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.293
It's time you told everyone
what we're really dealing with.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.265
- People died today because--

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:09.599
- How many more people
have to die

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:10.900
before the end of this day?

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:12.836
I'm not trying to find out.

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:16.473
- You want to save lives?
Start with us.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.475
Tell them about the nukes.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:21.411
I fucking knew it.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:29.119
- Look,
Reeves was right earlier.

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:32.122
God forbid something happens
to one of us.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.191
They're going to need to know
what the hell is going on.

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:46.870
Shit.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.944
There are two active footballs
on this planet

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:56.546
that have
direct operational access

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.316
to America's nuclear arsenal.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.118
One of them is with POTUS,

01:07:01.285 --> 01:07:02.552
the other
with the vice president.

01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:07.957
Earlier today,
when our motorcade was attacked,

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.729
the Secret Service agent
responsible for carrying this...

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:19.002
was killed,

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:22.506
and I took this from
him to keep it safe.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.874
- I-is that--
is that what I think it is?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:29.346
- It functions as a mobile hub
in our strategic defense system.

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:30.046
[device beeps]

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:37.521
How operational are we talking?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:41.758
- Launch, detonation, recall.
All of it.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.427
I mean, technically,
we can win World War Three

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.661
from our couch.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.330
- What are all those
little red dots?

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.498
- [Choi] <i>Locations of every</i>
<i>missile silo in America.</i>

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:50.800
- Okay, but we have safeguards,
right?

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:52.068
Gold codes.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:58.275
- Do you wanna know
what the hell this thing does?

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:08.785
[scanner beeps]

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:14.023
- It generates gold codes.
- Are you serious?

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.892
I'm not even trained
to carry this thing.

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.461
- You were right
to hide it today.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.130
- Why should we trust
either of you?

01:08:20.297 --> 01:08:22.599
- They must have known
Reeves and I

01:08:22.766 --> 01:08:24.734
were supposed to deliver this
to the VP today.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:29.239
And when they failed, they used
our own backup protocol

01:08:29.373 --> 01:08:30.874
against us to trap us here.

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:35.712
None of this was a coincidence.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.281
They've been playing us
all along.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.283
The VP wasn't the target.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.452
We were.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.056
[Sorello sighs]

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:53.663
[unsettling music builds up]

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.442
[Owens] <i>Come on.</i>

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:28.798
- No signal?
- No, nothing.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.401
Did you try the door?

01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:32.469
Yeah, I tried.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.343
Okay. Looks like we're back
in business here.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.810
- See if you can access
the footage

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:41.945
from the security cameras.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.146
When?

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.382
- Before we arrived.
The last 24 hours.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.385
I'm on it.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.524
- [Halton] <i>Power's going up</i>
<i>in the surveillance room.</i>

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:56.626
- Wow. At least one thing's
going right.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:58.928
- There's still
no internet signal,

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:00.830
but we got a monitor.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.506
[door pings]

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:13.943
[Choi] <i>Ssssh.</i>

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:15.479
- [device beeping]
- [Choi] <i>What's that beeping?</i>

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.918
Is that coming from the door?

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:24.921
Huh?

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:27.524
No.

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:28.658
- They're outside!
- [explosion]

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:29.759
[Choi grunts]

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.998
- Keep searching,
no matter what.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.900
Just make sure that decoder
doesn't fall into their hands.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.034
[Owens] <i>I'm on it.</i>

[Sorello] <i>Ah, fuck!</i>

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:50.013
Go, go!

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:51.047
[Halton] <i>Move it.</i>

01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:53.583
Clear.

Come on, come on, come on.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.008
Sorello.

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:20.777
[Sorello grunting]

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.078
- I can help you.
Go get the keys.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:23.480
Where were the keys?

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.081
Keys on the shelf right there.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:26.550
Get these cuffs off me, man.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.586
Get up. Come on.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:37.293
[overlapping grunting]

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.620
- [Owens]
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:06.756
Come on. Hurry up!

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.092
I could help you, Sorello.

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:10.427
Pass me the key.

It's a mother-fucking crusade.

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:19.508
Now for too long, real Americans
have been pushed to the side

when Owens and Choi

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:29.478
brought both devices right here.

this morning,
