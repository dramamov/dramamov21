THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:49.529
HWAUNJANG INN

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.535
ALARM
7:00 A.M., SUNDAY, JULY 5

00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:21.061
Assistant Manager Baek.

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:23.730
Mr. Baek.

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:26.066
-Get up.
-Why?

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.025
Come on, get up.

00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:29.277
Jeez.

00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:32.698
Gosh.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:38.870
Change into these.

00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.248
What? Oh, okay.

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:50.799
Goodness.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:54.344
"Our company's VDSL internet speed…"

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:56.596
"Our company's VDSL…"

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.687
"Our company's VDSL internet speed…"

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:08.358
"…averages 46 Mbps for downloads
and 10 Mbps for uploads."

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:11.445
"ACT also has
a much lower number of service issues…"

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:15.407
"ACT also has a much lower number
of service issues…"

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:18.493
Honestly, this car is way too slow.

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.705
Yes, it's pretty slow.

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:24.207
How are we supposed to make any sales
with a car this slow?

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.709
Why don't you try that again?

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:28.378
"ACT has far fewer…"

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.757
"ACT has far fewer service issues
compared to other companies."

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.135
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:37.095
Don't I look like Leslie Cheung?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.306
Gosh.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.641
Sorry. I almost cursed.

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:45.896
"ACT has far fewer service issues
compared to other companies."

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.856
That's it! You got it!

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:04.748
-Thank you!
-Sure.

00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:05.832
Thank you.

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:07.417
ACT, please come in.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:08.627
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:14.216
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.098
Thank you. We'll send you a contract.

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.437
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.563
Thank you so much!

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:31.066
Naraecom, please come in.

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:45.038
Sauna? Day drinking?

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:46.665
Let's hit the sauna first.

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.166
-Sauna!
-I'm exhausted.

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:21.241
MISSED CALLS
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.226
Hey, can we meet?

00:04:52.647 --> 00:04:56.484
You sounded depressed on the phone,
but you seem to have a huge appetite.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.323
It's a mystery.

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.617
I seriously had no appetite at home,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.827
but seeing you brought it right back.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:07.787
How strange.

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.081
-So what are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:13.835
You can't become an executive now.
Are you going to keep working there?

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.421
Hey, who says I can't?

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.174
If you caused that much trouble,
you're done for.

00:05:19.257 --> 00:05:21.760
Haven't you heard a thing I said?
I took care of it.

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.304
Fixing a problem you caused
is nothing to brag about.

00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:25.639
You're just back to square one.

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:26.890
I can make up for it.

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.102
Do you really think
you'd have enough time to do that?

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:34.564
Jeong-tae

00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:36.191
would never betray me.

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:37.609
He can't.

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:39.819
Your mentor who's a managing director now?

00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:43.907
Good God, Nak-su.

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:46.910
Executives are always
on the company's side.

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:49.412
You're not in a gang.
It's not about loyalty and betrayal.

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:50.705
What the hell would you know?

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.083
You're walking around in slippers
in broad daylight.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.043
You don't know anything
about major corporations.

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.753
Why did you call me, then?

00:05:58.797 --> 00:06:00.173
I had no one else to call.

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:04.010
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.894
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hi.

00:06:12.978 --> 00:06:14.980
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:06:15.063 --> 00:06:17.857
We want to tell you about
a great commercial building.

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:20.652
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.570
If you invest now,

00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:25.240
you'll be able to collect
about six to seven million won in rent.

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:28.034
It's under construction now
at a third-generation new town.

00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:31.788
We're currently offering a special
discount on our company-owned units.

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.415
We only have a few left.

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:34.958
We'll offer a special discount

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.751
below the market price.

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:38.503
Right. We'll think about it.

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:39.546
Sure.

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.090
Construction will finish in a few months,
so you'd better hurry.

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:43.758
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:45.677
-Bye, then.
-I…

00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:49.264
SALARY ENDS
BUT RENT DOESN'T

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:51.766
Hey, let me take a look.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.894
Kim Nak-su. Listen to me carefully.

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:57.522
If you want to survive
your remaining 50 years,

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.232
firstly, you should get rid of

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:00.984
-pamphlets like these.
-Hey!

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:02.277
What's wrong with you?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.155
Secondly,
if you're just having three beers,

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.033
don't spend over 1,500 won on snacks.

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.119
Jeez. You own a building.

00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:14.664
If you're collecting 30 million won
in rent, spend some money.

00:07:14.748 --> 00:07:16.124
Help keep the economy moving.

00:07:16.207 --> 00:07:18.960
This is how I bought a building,
you idiot.

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.216
Gosh.

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:35.685
People these days
have so much money to throw around.

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:37.270
All done.

00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:38.730
-Thank you. Bye.
-Thank you.

00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:40.482
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:43.318
This is the latest model
that can connect to your phone.

00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:45.070
It's… expensive.

00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:47.113
It's expensive.

00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:50.200
They're showing off in front of me
on purpose, right?

00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:52.077
Thank you so much, guys.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.329
Mom, this is way better than ours.

00:07:54.412 --> 00:07:56.831
It's a higher-end model
that came out last month.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:58.958
Ha-jin.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.711
-Move over.
-Hey!

00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:04.005
Ha-jin, did you ask him?

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:04.964
What?

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.383
Did you ask Nak-su
about Sang-cheol's business?

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.385
No.

00:08:10.428 --> 00:08:13.431
We treated you to an expensive hotel meal.
What were you doing all this time?

00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:14.849
I was busy.

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:17.143
Why would you be busy? You're not working.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:18.311
What about you, then?

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:20.480
What do you do besides
group buying enzyme supplements?

00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:22.357
I'm studying for a certificate.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.109
What certificate?

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:27.737
Pet funeral director.

00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:28.947
Isn't that awesome?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.909
That did seem pretty promising.

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.536
Right?

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:38.373
I actually studied for the real estate
license exam for a while.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.756
Sang-cheol! Mom!

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.634
Ha-jin's trying
to get a real estate license.

00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:51.845
Hey, what's so funny about that?

00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:53.930
-With your brains?
-My goodness.

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:57.809
You're 50, and you still haven't realized
you're not cut out for studying?

00:08:57.892 --> 00:09:00.603
-Mom!
-For real. She's so funny.

00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:03.982
Ha-jin,
that's a government-issued license.

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:05.441
You know that?

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.569
She must think
it's like a driver's license.

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:08.611
Unbelievable.

00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:10.738
Give it a try. I'm sure you'll do well.

00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:11.948
Oh, right!

00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:16.411
I'm getting a fully featured SUV
in two months.

00:09:17.203 --> 00:09:19.956
If you pass the exam,

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:22.750
I'll give it to you.

00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:24.502
-I mean it.
-Honey.

00:09:24.586 --> 00:09:26.129
What if she really does pass?

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:29.757
I mean, it's not
that I don't want to give it to you.

00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:33.928
I'll give it to you completely new
and with the plastic covers still on,

00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:35.638
as soon as it gets here.

00:09:35.722 --> 00:09:36.890
I mean it.

00:09:36.973 --> 00:09:38.933
Honey, stop it.

00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:40.810
What?

00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:43.646
Ha-jin got a driver's license.
I'm sure she can do this too.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.399
You can do it, Ha-jin.
I'm sure you can pass.

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:57.243
EPISODE 4
HANGING BY A THREAD

00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:22.977
Hey, were you busy?

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:24.771
Yes.

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:27.482
I took a pretty long nap.

00:10:27.565 --> 00:10:28.441
I see.

00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:31.527
What's the occasion?

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:32.946
Well…

00:10:33.988 --> 00:10:35.365
Let's have dinner sometime.

00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:38.368
Of course. Sounds great.

00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:39.827
Do you have time next week?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.996
Well…

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.289
How about tomorrow, then?

00:10:43.373 --> 00:10:44.958
Tomorrow?

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:46.709
Is that inconvenient for you?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.241
Well, I…

00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:51.589
-What about Tuesday?
-Jeong-tae.

00:10:51.673 --> 00:10:53.508
Why don't you come over next weekend?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.593
To your house?

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:57.595
Yes. My wife said

00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:00.139
she hasn't seen you in a while,
so she'd like you to come.

00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:01.766
Well, that's…

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.810
Oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:05.270
It's completely fine.

00:11:05.353 --> 00:11:08.106
Why don't you come over next week?

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:10.608
Next Sunday evening.

00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:12.527
Nak-su, let's just eat

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.488
near the office on a weekday after work.

00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:18.533
Please, I really want
to treat you to a proper meal.

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:21.619
Just come over
next Sunday evening, all right?

00:11:21.703 --> 00:11:22.829
My goodness.

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:24.580
It's settled, right? Bye, then.

00:11:32.672 --> 00:11:34.507
He's being so difficult.

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:39.679
I need to buy some time.

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.389
Buy time for what? What's going on?

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:44.851
-Ha-jin.
-Yes?

00:11:45.727 --> 00:11:47.562
Help your husband out this one time.

00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:50.189
If you need to,
hire someone to help you cook.

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:51.274
I'll help too.

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:54.861
Is something going on?

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:57.655
No, not at all.

00:11:57.739 --> 00:12:00.575
I'm just inviting Jeong-tae over
to seal the deal.

00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:02.702
Honey.

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.495
It's okay. Trust me.

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:05.913
It's fine.

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:14.797
Honey, about Sang-cheol…

00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:15.757
Sang-cheol?

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:17.425
What about him?

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:20.845
Did he not say anything
when you met that YouTuber?

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:22.638
No. What do you mean?

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.725
Wait.

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.019
How do you know about that?

00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:30.813
Is it wrong for me to know?

00:12:30.897 --> 00:12:32.023
So what's this about?

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:35.902
Well, Sang-cheol's going to launch
his own business soon.

00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:38.237
And?

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:42.533
It's going to be something big
related to fintech.

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:43.951
So?

00:12:44.452 --> 00:12:46.537
If, by any chance,

00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:48.664
you don't become an executive this year,

00:12:48.748 --> 00:12:51.501
do you have any other plans?

00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:52.460
You want me

00:12:52.543 --> 00:12:54.921
to work under Sang-cheol
if I don't get the promotion?

00:12:55.004 --> 00:12:58.674
He can give you a much better offer.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.522
What are you saying about me
behind my back?

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.109
I didn't say anything.

00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:17.985
You must have said something about me

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:20.738
that made Sang-cheol want
to ask me to work for him.

00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:24.367
I was only asking for your opinion.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.411
A better offer?

00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:30.123
Have you been telling your sister's family

00:13:30.206 --> 00:13:32.291
about my salary and everything?

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.711
No, Sang-cheol just looked it up himself.

00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:38.297
That brat thinks money is everything.

00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:40.716
He's just a clueless techie.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.136
Does he think
he's working in Silicon Valley or what?

00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:44.846
How dare he?

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.848
-Honey.
-Jeez.

00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:48.933
Even though he's family,

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:50.810
you could at least think about it.

00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:53.896
It's not like he's going to make you
clean the building.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.983
He'll be treating you
as an experienced professional.

00:13:57.066 --> 00:13:58.985
Experienced professional?

00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:01.737
You think it's really me that he wants?

00:14:01.821 --> 00:14:03.197
Then what?

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:06.284
It's this, okay?

00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:09.162
The connections of a general manager
at a major corporation.

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:10.955
Don't be stupid.

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:13.332
If I go there, he'll just use me for that

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.835
and kick me out.
You really think he won't do that?

00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:18.421
Even if I don't get a promotion,
I'll never work for him.

00:14:18.504 --> 00:14:20.423
I've made myself clear,
so go and tell him that.

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:23.426
Why are you going around
saying useless stuff about me?

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:30.016
Fine, do whatever you want.

00:14:31.017 --> 00:14:33.728
What about you, then?
Do you think you're some top-tier talent?

00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:35.438
Jeez.

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:38.941
Do you think you're the only
general manager in the country?

00:14:39.025 --> 00:14:40.693
-Stop it.
-If you're so great,

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:42.320
why did you get help from Sang-cheol?

00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:45.990
You should've told him what you just said,
"I can do everything on my own."

00:14:46.073 --> 00:14:47.200
That's different.

00:14:47.283 --> 00:14:50.077
He contacted me first and offered to help.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.373
Do you know why he called you?

00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:59.413
…got an email from ACT's Sales Team 1,
asking me to take the video down.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:02.173
Why should I take down my video?
Why should I? Why?

00:15:09.222 --> 00:15:10.723
Sang-cheol.

00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:14.393
You said you were close to him, right?

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.523
Well, he's an acquaintance.

00:15:18.606 --> 00:15:20.858
Then could you

00:15:20.942 --> 00:15:25.530
give my husband
a chance to talk to him in person?

00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:27.114
You asked him to help?

00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:28.491
Yes.

00:15:28.574 --> 00:15:32.328
I thought you'd be
having a lot of trouble at work,

00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:34.372
so I helped you out.

00:15:35.414 --> 00:15:36.874
Does that hurt your pride too?

00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:40.503
Hey. Kim Nak-su.

00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:43.381
Jeez.

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:46.259
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:50.471
You don't know how to be grateful.

00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:52.598
You think you got this far on your own.

00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:54.892
-That's enough.
-Your personality isn't great, either.

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.812
You're so touchy and cranky with others.

00:15:57.895 --> 00:16:00.940
You really are the worst, Nak-su.

00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:03.651
You're being way too harsh.

00:16:04.527 --> 00:16:07.071
It doesn't matter if it's Jeong-tae
or the president himself,

00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:08.990
I'm not doing anything.

00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:10.074
Honey.

00:16:10.157 --> 00:16:14.287
Cook braised ribs
or handmade noodles all by yourself.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.497
Do it on your own.

00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.542
Honey, you agreed to help me just now.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.168
When did I agree?

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.966
I've done enough.

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:31.304
I raised Su-gyeom,
and I did my duties as a daughter-in-law.

00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:34.682
I helped you protect your pride.

00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:36.892
-Honey.
-Our married life…

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:41.022
is entering a new chapter.

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:42.231
What are you saying?

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:43.232
Got that?

00:16:43.316 --> 00:16:46.611
Hey, you're scaring me. Come on.

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:48.362
Honey!

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.758
-Mr. Kim…
-Is Mr. Kim still not here?

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.968
It's strange for him to be late.

00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:15.806
You're here, Mr. Kim.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.391
This is quite heavy.

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:20.394
What is all this, sir?

00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:22.980
This is for you, Song-hee.

00:17:23.648 --> 00:17:24.815
And Sung-gu.

00:17:24.899 --> 00:17:26.275
-Here.
-Hang on.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.319
Why are you so startled? Here, Ik-hyeon.

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:29.445
Thank you, sir.

00:17:30.488 --> 00:17:31.364
Are you…

00:17:33.032 --> 00:17:34.700
collecting reward points for something?

00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:36.035
What do you mean?

00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:39.413
It's nothing. Thank you, sir.

00:17:39.497 --> 00:17:40.623
Right--

00:17:40.706 --> 00:17:41.707
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:43.292
Are you…

00:17:45.002 --> 00:17:46.962
-quitting?
-Hey.

00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:49.674
Is it that strange for me
to buy you coffee?

00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:52.343
-No, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

00:17:52.426 --> 00:17:53.969
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:59.225
Why don't we go talk on the rooftop?

00:18:01.936 --> 00:18:03.229
-Sure.
-After I put this down.

00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:04.730
-Okay.
-Good.

00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:07.983
Let's go make some sales.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.866
Right now?

00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:20.162
Let's think of this week
as a special sales week

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:23.541
and get out there.
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:28.003
Sir, I have a lot of work piled up,
so I can't really go out.

00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:29.880
Do…

00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:31.882
Do you have that much work?

00:18:32.508 --> 00:18:34.927
You told us to come up with

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.596
five new product ideas last time.

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:41.892
Well, you can take your time on that.

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.939
Sir, how about we go for a smoke?

00:18:47.022 --> 00:18:48.315
I didn't bring my cigarettes.

00:18:48.399 --> 00:18:49.400
I have some.

00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:52.862
-Don't talk behind my back.
-Come on.

00:18:56.157 --> 00:18:59.785
I'm sure you felt it,
but they're not pleased.

00:19:00.327 --> 00:19:02.079
Why is everyone so harsh on me?

00:19:02.163 --> 00:19:03.998
What did I do so wrong?

00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:06.000
This is just like politics.

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.836
It's hard to get anything done
without good approval ratings.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:10.337
I'm on your side,

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:13.215
but if you tell me to abandon my work
to go make sales,

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:14.675
that's still going to be tough.

00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:17.094
So what am I supposed to do?

00:19:18.554 --> 00:19:21.557
What you need right now is populism.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.350
Coffee and donuts won't cut it?

00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:24.727
Of course not, sir.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.605
We're not soldiers waiting
for the church to hand out snacks.

00:19:34.236 --> 00:19:35.696
All right.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.788
Help me out, guys.

00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:47.500
If you do, I'll repay you
with great performance reviews.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:51.545
You'll be promoted to assistant manager,
then manager, and senior manager.

00:19:52.505 --> 00:19:54.840
I promise to give you
great performance reviews.

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:56.133
Prepare for promotion!

00:19:56.217 --> 00:19:57.301
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:59.345
Big success!

00:19:59.428 --> 00:20:01.138
Promotions for everyone!

00:20:01.222 --> 00:20:02.097
One more time!

00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:03.682
Big success!

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:06.560
Promotions for everyone!

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:13.651
I'll be a manager!

00:20:21.784 --> 00:20:24.078
Then Ik-hyeon will go on his own.

00:20:24.161 --> 00:20:25.162
Sung-gu, you're with me.

00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:26.163
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:20:26.247 --> 00:20:28.415
Song-hee's planning our routes,
so let's hurry.

00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:29.708
-Okay.
-Are there any cars left?

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:31.794
We didn't book any in advance,
so there's only one.

00:20:31.877 --> 00:20:33.921
Then hurry up and reserve it.
We can't lose it.

00:20:34.004 --> 00:20:35.965
I'll use my car.

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:37.508
I'll look for the car,

00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:39.301
-so go get the keys.
-Okay.

00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:40.678
Hey, wait!

00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:42.513
You should tell me the plate number.

00:20:42.596 --> 00:20:43.597
It's 7982.

00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:45.099
Okay. 7982.

00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:46.559
I'll go on ahead.

00:20:46.642 --> 00:20:48.352
Okay. Be careful.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.522
All right. 7982.

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:54.650
Where's 7982?

00:20:57.194 --> 00:20:59.363
It's 7982.

00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:01.198
Where is it?

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:10.457
Jeez.

00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:14.461
Mr. Kim.

00:21:14.545 --> 00:21:17.464
It must be an old car, judging by the key.
Did you find it?

00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:18.966
Here it is.

00:21:19.717 --> 00:21:20.634
Where?

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:23.178
This one.

00:21:26.307 --> 00:21:27.892
Darn it.

00:21:27.975 --> 00:21:29.393
Holy crap.

00:21:29.476 --> 00:21:31.520
-My goodness.
-Does this thing even move?

00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:33.814
Open the door.

00:21:33.898 --> 00:21:35.065
Okay.

00:21:36.483 --> 00:21:37.985
Oh my.

00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:42.823
The mileage is lower
than I thought, though.

00:21:42.907 --> 00:21:44.158
Just 280,000?

00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:47.036
It was too big to go make outside sales,
so we hardly drove it.

00:21:48.746 --> 00:21:49.955
And it's a manual.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:53.751
Why didn't they get rid of this car?

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:56.086
-Should I drive?
-Pardon?

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.212
I'll do it.

00:22:16.023 --> 00:22:17.566
Gosh, it's working.

00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:21.779
I feel like this might be a sign.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.218
Mr. Baek.

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:45.803
Hey.

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:47.012
Hello, sir.

00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:49.807
Where is everyone?

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.935
They're working off-site.

00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:54.353
All three of them?

00:22:54.436 --> 00:22:55.479
Yes.

00:22:56.355 --> 00:22:57.398
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

00:22:57.481 --> 00:22:59.274
When do you think they'll be back?

00:22:59.358 --> 00:23:02.319
Well… I'll check.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.988
No, it's fine.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:05.364
Okay.

00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:09.326
-Keep working, then.
-Okay.

00:23:19.586 --> 00:23:20.546
Let's see.

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:22.214
Make a list of our top renewal partners…

00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:23.298
CONTRACTED COMPANIES

00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:25.175
…and send it to Mr. Song.

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:26.176
B ROUTE, MR. SONG

00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:31.098
Then a list of the companies
unlikely to renew…

00:23:32.558 --> 00:23:33.892
A ROUTE, MR. KIM AND MR. JUNG

00:23:33.976 --> 00:23:35.144
Send to Mr. Kim.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.274
He's the general manager, after all.

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:41.316
SALES TEAM 1 GROUP CHAT

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.276
SEND FILE

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:43.736
You got Song-hee's file, right?

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:48.323
-Yes, I got it.
-We'll be going clockwise from Namyangju.

00:23:48.407 --> 00:23:50.659
You start in Bucheon
and just cover the whole area.

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:51.660
Yes, sir.

00:23:51.744 --> 00:23:52.619
Good luck.

00:23:52.703 --> 00:23:53.871
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:55.789
Good luck.

00:23:56.707 --> 00:23:57.708
All right.

00:23:57.791 --> 00:24:01.003
Gosh, I drove this car for a few years
when I was an assistant manager.

00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:02.296
I haven't been in it since.

00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:03.547
Really?

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.258
This car is as old as my son, Su-gyeom.

00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:07.426
Isn't that funny?

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:08.927
Su-gyeom's in college already.

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:11.972
You look happy, sir.

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:15.684
It's been a while
since I've felt this good about work.

00:24:16.393 --> 00:24:17.519
Let's go.

00:24:17.603 --> 00:24:18.812
Let's go!

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.287
Aren't you just ignoring them?

00:24:40.042 --> 00:24:41.710
It's just a cultural difference.

00:24:41.794 --> 00:24:43.378
What?

00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:58.227
If you drink facing each other,
that means you're equals.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.604
But we think that's disrespectful
to your elders.

00:25:01.522 --> 00:25:02.981
So,

00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:07.361
we lower our heads or turn to the side.

00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:08.862
-Like this?
-Yes.

00:25:10.823 --> 00:25:12.825
Have you made up your mind, then?

00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:21.750
I'll shatter it.

00:25:22.793 --> 00:25:24.753
Like a bird breaking out from its shell,

00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:27.673
I'll break your company's shell

00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:30.467
so that you guys can fly.

00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:37.891
CDO
KIM SU-GYEOM

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.535
CDO, CHIEF DESTRUCTION OFFICER
KIM SU-GYEOM

00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:02.749
It took you long enough to decide.

00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:05.419
I'm not easy to convince, you know.

00:26:09.423 --> 00:26:11.925
Your eyebrows are the same
as when you were little.

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:14.178
What?

00:26:17.347 --> 00:26:18.765
You brought this too.

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:20.392
Yes.

00:26:22.811 --> 00:26:24.521
I'll look forward to your work.

00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:46.001
Let's get to work.

00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:47.419
HANJEON KKE

00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:50.923
I don't think we can do it.
Our budget was cut by 30% this year.

00:26:51.006 --> 00:26:53.425
If you use our ultra-low-cost
maintenance package,

00:26:53.508 --> 00:26:55.219
you won't have to replace any equipment.

00:26:55.302 --> 00:26:56.470
If you look here,

00:26:56.553 --> 00:26:59.389
it's only 890,000 won a month
for a yearly contract.

00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:01.600
For just an extra 150,000 won,

00:27:01.683 --> 00:27:03.435
you'll be assigned
a dedicated security team.

00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:06.605
So we'll be able to respond in real time

00:27:06.688 --> 00:27:09.358
and instantly block
any external hacking attempts.

00:27:09.441 --> 00:27:11.777
It would be rock-solid security!

00:27:19.868 --> 00:27:22.788
ENERGY DRINK

00:27:24.665 --> 00:27:27.334
We'll cover the full cost
of the server replacement.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.337
Plus a 7% discount on the fees.

00:27:30.963 --> 00:27:32.839
Hang on. Sir?

00:27:32.923 --> 00:27:35.300
We're offering a special discount
as a token of gratitude

00:27:35.384 --> 00:27:37.094
since you're serving our country.

00:27:37.177 --> 00:27:38.762
Get out.

00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:41.515
ACT makes my blood boil.

00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:43.934
I promise to oversee
the maintenance myself, sir.

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:44.977
Sir, let's go.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.062
You can call me late at night
or on holidays.

00:27:47.145 --> 00:27:48.730
-Let's go. Come on.
-I'll come right away.

00:27:48.814 --> 00:27:50.649
-We'll visit again.
-Even on Christmas Eve.

00:27:50.732 --> 00:27:52.401
-Are you kidding me?
-Please just…

00:27:52.484 --> 00:27:53.735
Get out of my sight!

00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:57.864
-This--
-Excuse me.

00:27:57.948 --> 00:28:00.534
Hello. I'm from ACT.

00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:02.202
You're here for the renewal.

00:28:02.286 --> 00:28:05.038
-Yes.
-Process the renewal. So…

00:28:05.122 --> 00:28:05.998
Right.

00:28:06.832 --> 00:28:09.209
-Here, have one.
-Thank you.

00:28:09.293 --> 00:28:10.919
-It's done.
-All done?

00:28:11.003 --> 00:28:13.130
REST AREA

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:21.305
Mr. Kim.

00:28:21.847 --> 00:28:23.390
Here.

00:28:23.473 --> 00:28:24.349
Gosh.

00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:30.022
Nice.

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:35.652
It's my first time making
20 outside sales in a single day.

00:28:35.736 --> 00:28:37.487
We haven't even done half yet.

00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:41.825
It seems like Song-hee gave us
the tougher of the two routes.

00:28:41.908 --> 00:28:43.201
That Song-hee…

00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:50.208
We should head back now.

00:28:51.168 --> 00:28:52.377
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:54.254
Why don't we just stay somewhere nearby?

00:28:54.338 --> 00:28:55.464
Pardon?

00:28:56.423 --> 00:28:59.051
I mean, we'll have to go to Seoul,
then back here again tomorrow.

00:28:59.134 --> 00:29:02.137
I'm sure it would be exhausting
to go back and forth.

00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:09.603
Actually, never mind.
It's not the '90s anymore.

00:29:09.686 --> 00:29:10.729
Let's go.

00:29:10.812 --> 00:29:13.148
I love the idea, Mr. Kim.

00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:14.316
What?

00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:16.109
I'll drive this time.

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:19.279
Get in, sir.

00:29:19.363 --> 00:29:21.323
-Are you sure?
-You must be tired.

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:27.788
WIN REAL ESTATE EXAM ACADEMY

00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:30.665
-I just told you.
-You're canceling your refund?

00:29:30.749 --> 00:29:33.710
So you're enrolling again?

00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:35.462
Yes.

00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:38.924
But the course has already started.

00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:41.259
I'll study hard and catch up.

00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:44.971
All right. Wait a moment.

00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:50.102
Hi, we've got a bit
of a tricky case here right now.

00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:51.770
THE 2024 HALL OF FAME
FASTEST EXAM PASSERS

00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:53.522
Can she join in the middle of the course?

00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:57.609
I know it's not allowed,
but can't we make it work?

00:29:58.276 --> 00:29:59.653
Right.

00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:04.658
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.119
UNIT ENTRANCE

00:30:07.202 --> 00:30:09.037
Did Ha-jin say she was coming to visit?

00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:09.996
No.

00:30:18.004 --> 00:30:19.005
Hello.

00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:23.552
Put it in writing!

00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:25.512
An agreement?

00:30:25.595 --> 00:30:26.930
When is your car being delivered?

00:30:28.265 --> 00:30:29.558
Why are you asking?

00:30:29.641 --> 00:30:30.851
If I pass the exam,

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:34.729
you'd better give me that car
like you said!

00:30:34.813 --> 00:30:36.314
Make a written agreement!

00:30:36.398 --> 00:30:37.774
Excuse me,

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:39.359
Ha-jin…

00:30:40.152 --> 00:30:41.236
Ha-jin.

00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:43.989
Were you that upset about what I said?

00:30:44.072 --> 00:30:47.075
You said that I could never pass the exam!

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:49.786
Of course you can't. Not with your brains.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.664
All right, then.
So let's put it in writing.

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:54.291
Don't go back on your word later.

00:30:54.374 --> 00:30:55.584
Ha-jin.

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:57.752
Ha-yeong, that's my eighth wedding
anniversary gift--

00:30:57.836 --> 00:30:59.963
Fine! I'll write an agreement.

00:31:00.046 --> 00:31:01.506
Honey!

00:31:04.426 --> 00:31:05.677
But Ha-jin,

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.931
that car's fully featured,
so it's about 90 million won.

00:31:10.015 --> 00:31:12.934
If you fail, what will you give me?

00:31:14.603 --> 00:31:15.479
What?

00:31:15.562 --> 00:31:16.688
I mean, think about it.

00:31:16.771 --> 00:31:18.732
This is such a one-sided bet, isn't it?

00:31:18.815 --> 00:31:21.776
You should put something on the line too.

00:31:23.528 --> 00:31:26.239
You want me to bet something, too?

00:31:30.869 --> 00:31:31.912
Never mind.

00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:34.247
You don't need to bet anything.

00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:38.502
You'll get my car if you pass,
and if you fail…

00:31:39.753 --> 00:31:43.465
I'll never let you live it down.

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:46.426
Ha-yeong.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.222
You really think I'm a joke, don't you?

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:53.016
Of course I do.

00:31:54.184 --> 00:31:58.855
I know… you'll never pass.

00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:03.068
You better not regret it.

00:32:03.693 --> 00:32:04.819
I won't.

00:32:06.363 --> 00:32:08.073
MAY 12TH, 2025
SIGNED BY PARK HA-YEONG

00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:15.455
Ha-jin,

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:17.666
wait…

00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:21.503
AGREEMENT

00:32:21.586 --> 00:32:24.214
Mr. Kim, would you like some beer?

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:25.590
Sure.

00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:27.425
All right.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.596
What should we have with it?

00:32:32.222 --> 00:32:34.808
Three flavors of dried squid? Nice.

00:32:41.231 --> 00:32:42.607
I'm home.

00:32:43.108 --> 00:32:44.109
Hey.

00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:53.493
"The amount of additional tax
is the tax base multiplied by…"

00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:59.583
"The amount of additional tax
is the tax base multiplied by…"

00:33:03.972 --> 00:33:05.630
REAL ESTATE LAW
FOR THE REAL ESTATE AGENTS

00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:09.426
Mom, are you studying
for the real estate license again?

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:10.385
Yes.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.972
-What about Dad?
-What about him?

00:33:14.055 --> 00:33:15.181
I mean,

00:33:15.724 --> 00:33:17.892
I thought you'd take Dad's side.

00:33:19.185 --> 00:33:24.399
That was the case until last week.
But now, I'm different.

00:33:25.025 --> 00:33:27.694
I've washed your dad's underwear
for 20 years,

00:33:27.777 --> 00:33:29.738
so now I deserve to do this for myself.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.531
Don't you think so?

00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:33.908
-Right.
-Good.

00:33:34.993 --> 00:33:36.828
That thing you're doing with your friends.

00:33:36.911 --> 00:33:38.163
Is it going well?

00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:39.164
Me?

00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:40.999
Well…

00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:47.464
We can do it.

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:51.009
That was close!

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:53.011
It's okay.

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:54.763
-It's okay.
-Take your time.

00:33:56.014 --> 00:33:57.057
You did great, Han-na.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.224
Han-na, Han-na.

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.186
Han-na.

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:02.979
-Yes?
-I'm heading home first.

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:10.654
It went in!

00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:13.281
You did it.

00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:14.699
Bye.

00:34:14.783 --> 00:34:16.242
He's playing now.

00:34:16.326 --> 00:34:18.453
Bye!

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:21.706
It's… pretty tough.

00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:23.792
It's tough, Mom.

00:34:25.043 --> 00:34:25.960
Tell me about it.

00:34:26.044 --> 00:34:27.837
Studying again after all these years

00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:30.882
is really tough.

00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:32.133
Good luck, then.

00:34:32.217 --> 00:34:33.510
Okay.

00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:35.053
I'll do my best.

00:34:41.267 --> 00:34:42.227
So,

00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:45.522
you're already living together?

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:46.648
Yes.

00:34:48.775 --> 00:34:49.901
It's nice, of course.

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:51.778
I love her.

00:34:52.487 --> 00:34:55.782
I care about her so much.
I want to do whatever she asks me to do,

00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:57.701
and it's fun spending time with her.

00:34:58.201 --> 00:34:59.160
But…

00:35:01.162 --> 00:35:04.374
I keep thinking,
"Why isn't she going back to her place?"

00:35:06.459 --> 00:35:07.335
Sung-gu.

00:35:07.419 --> 00:35:08.336
Yes?

00:35:09.879 --> 00:35:11.548
That's what marriage is.

00:35:15.093 --> 00:35:20.098
I want to play games, clean my house,
and spend some time resting by myself,

00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:22.434
but she won't go home.

00:35:22.517 --> 00:35:23.685
Gosh.

00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:29.774
But why am I even having
these thoughts in the first place?

00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:35.739
That's your life now, Sung-gu.

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:41.828
Mr. Kim.

00:35:42.579 --> 00:35:44.289
Should I not get married?

00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:45.665
You should.

00:35:45.749 --> 00:35:47.542
-Why?
-Just do it.

00:35:48.251 --> 00:35:49.377
Do it.

00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:10.774
Sir, are you asleep?

00:36:12.484 --> 00:36:13.526
No.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.238
Then can I ask you something?

00:36:17.906 --> 00:36:18.907
Sure.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.245
Will these rushed sales

00:36:24.329 --> 00:36:29.209
really help you, Mr. Kim?

00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:36.841
Or are you doing this
because you're hoping it will help you?

00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:41.137
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

00:36:43.598 --> 00:36:46.017
When you got two outs
in the bottom of the ninth,

00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:49.521
you have to clear your mind.

00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:54.192
You tell yourself,
"I'll get a pitch I like,"

00:36:54.275 --> 00:36:56.319
and just take a full swing.

00:36:57.487 --> 00:36:59.447
That's the best way to deal with it.

00:37:01.533 --> 00:37:03.451
What? Is it hard to understand?

00:37:03.535 --> 00:37:05.495
No, I understand.

00:37:06.579 --> 00:37:07.914
But…

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:13.711
I don't think I could've made it

00:37:13.795 --> 00:37:15.922
to being in the ninth inning
with two outs.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.008
I guess it's different for you,

00:37:20.134 --> 00:37:22.470
since you have a lot to protect.

00:37:25.473 --> 00:37:27.016
Mr. Kim.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.271
I think what I'm truly scared of
is not marriage itself,

00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:35.775
but the burden of being
the head of the family.

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:42.031
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

00:37:43.616 --> 00:37:48.997
One day, when you reach my age
and are in the same circumstances as me,

00:37:49.622 --> 00:37:52.208
you might come home

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:56.337
only to find all the lights out,
the living room empty,

00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:00.675
no dinner smell coming from the kitchen,

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:03.469
and no one there to welcome you.

00:38:07.056 --> 00:38:08.850
Having to bear

00:38:09.642 --> 00:38:12.437
that terrifying loneliness
at the age of 50…

00:38:14.898 --> 00:38:16.816
Not everyone can do that.

00:38:17.984 --> 00:38:20.194
Not me, at least.

00:38:21.779 --> 00:38:23.823
Protecting my family,

00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:27.410
that's really just me

00:38:28.995 --> 00:38:30.705
protecting myself.

00:38:31.623 --> 00:38:33.458
It's not something sacred or noble.

00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:36.044
I'm just protecting myself.

00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:40.465
You should record stuff like this--

00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:42.926
He's asleep.

00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:48.598
NEW RECORDING

00:38:50.224 --> 00:38:52.101
Why would you record something like that?

00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:53.436
You're ridiculous.

00:38:54.103 --> 00:38:56.940
Mr. Kim, I'll see you in my dreams.

00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:03.363
When did he start recording?

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.018
Good morning.

00:39:34.102 --> 00:39:36.020
Good morning.

00:39:36.104 --> 00:39:37.730
Gosh, this is a lot.

00:39:37.814 --> 00:39:40.149
I'm sure you checked everything already.

00:39:40.233 --> 00:39:43.695
Seeing this makes me realize
just how incredible you are.

00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:45.697
You got all these renewals in one day.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.117
Didn't you give me a list
of loyal customers on purpose?

00:39:54.372 --> 00:39:56.124
You shouldn't hate Mr. Kim so much.

00:39:57.542 --> 00:39:58.960
I don't hate him.

00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:05.133
Well, they were a team of two, and…

00:40:07.552 --> 00:40:11.014
someone who earns more
should take on more responsibility.

00:40:14.475 --> 00:40:16.769
That's what being a team leader
is all about.

00:40:19.105 --> 00:40:20.523
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

00:40:20.606 --> 00:40:21.691
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

00:40:21.774 --> 00:40:22.859
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:23.901
Hi.

00:40:25.903 --> 00:40:28.531
Is Nak-su out of the office again?

00:40:28.614 --> 00:40:29.991
Well, no.

00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:32.452
He spent the night near a client

00:40:32.535 --> 00:40:33.995
and started work there right away.

00:40:34.078 --> 00:40:35.079
I see.

00:40:36.247 --> 00:40:37.498
He's working so hard.

00:40:37.582 --> 00:40:38.541
Yes, sir.

00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:41.127
-Get back to work, then.
-Yes, sir.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.545
Keep up the good work.

00:40:42.628 --> 00:40:44.255
-Sir.
-Sir.

00:40:44.338 --> 00:40:45.882
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

00:40:45.965 --> 00:40:47.300
Bye.

00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:52.555
Why are you making me
feel so uncomfortable, Nak-su?

00:40:53.598 --> 00:40:56.142
So you mean the employees
of the Korea Fair Trade Commission

00:40:56.225 --> 00:40:58.019
saw the photo you took with the directors

00:40:58.102 --> 00:41:01.147
when Nak-su got a hole-in-one?

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.565
Jeez.

00:41:03.441 --> 00:41:05.151
I can't believe this is happening.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:11.908
Bad things keep happening
to Nak-su these days.

00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:13.409
It's pretty concerning.

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:18.414
Here. I did as you asked.

00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:20.249
Right.

00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:22.794
I listed the expected effects
and allocated tasks…

00:41:22.877 --> 00:41:23.878
SALES TEAM INTEGRATION

00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:27.965
…of merging Sales Teams 1 and 2.
I also tried rearranging the team members.

00:41:34.847 --> 00:41:36.057
You put your name…

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.183
TEAM LEADER, DO JIN-WOO

00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:38.643
…as the team leader.

00:41:39.268 --> 00:41:40.186
Yes.

00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:43.773
Why are you so sure

00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.110
you'll be the team leader and not Nak-su?

00:41:47.193 --> 00:41:48.319
Well,

00:41:48.986 --> 00:41:50.279
isn't Nak-su…

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:55.451
going to be an executive now?

00:41:57.203 --> 00:41:59.122
I thought it was obvious.

00:42:07.505 --> 00:42:08.756
You really…

00:42:10.383 --> 00:42:12.426
don't put pressure on people.

00:42:24.397 --> 00:42:27.024
KUKKIWON
WORLD TAEKWONDO HEADQUARTERS

00:42:27.108 --> 00:42:28.818
It's here. The conference room.

00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:32.029
KOREA'S NATIONAL MARTIAL ART, TAEKWONDO

00:42:33.447 --> 00:42:35.199
They're in the middle of a meeting.

00:42:39.036 --> 00:42:41.122
No need to feel
too much pressure, Mr. Kim.

00:42:41.205 --> 00:42:43.166
-Right.
-This is Taejeong's turf, after all.

00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:45.668
It'd be nice to win them over.
If not, no big deal.

00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:46.961
Right.

00:42:50.673 --> 00:42:52.925
Also, the call for bids went out already,
so we're late.

00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:54.468
They're coming out.

00:42:55.553 --> 00:42:57.138
You're from ACT, right?

00:42:57.221 --> 00:42:59.056
-Yes, hello.
-Nice to meet you.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.641
I'm General Manager Kim Nak-su.

00:43:01.434 --> 00:43:02.476
I'm Jung Sung-gu.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.603
-Right.
-Nice to meet you.

00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:06.772
Sorry, but our meeting just ended,

00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:09.066
so could we take a 15-minute break first?

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.735
Yes, of course. That's fine.

00:43:10.818 --> 00:43:12.862
Then could we wait inside?

00:43:12.945 --> 00:43:13.821
Sure.

00:43:16.115 --> 00:43:17.366
Good work, sir.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.911
-I'll see you later.
-Bye.

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:23.289
Sorry, this won't take long.

00:43:23.372 --> 00:43:25.249
It's okay, take your time…

00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:29.253
Mr. Heo.

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:44.727
Here.

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:49.857
Did you quit?

00:43:51.108 --> 00:43:54.528
Are you offering a cigarette to someone
who almost died from charcoal fumes?

00:43:54.612 --> 00:43:55.571
Sorry.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.659
It's fine. I know you don't care
about anyone else besides yourself.

00:44:04.247 --> 00:44:07.750
I heard you quit,
but I didn't know you joined Taejeong.

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:11.379
You're a senior manager there?
That's nice.

00:44:11.462 --> 00:44:12.672
Not really.

00:44:13.214 --> 00:44:15.633
My salary's only half
of what I earned at ACT.

00:44:16.842 --> 00:44:18.552
You guys are so cruel.

00:44:18.636 --> 00:44:21.973
You came here to steal our client?
Are you trying to bleed us dry?

00:44:22.056 --> 00:44:23.724
We're not doing so well, either.

00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:25.268
You know that yourself.

00:44:25.351 --> 00:44:27.645
We're doing a dozen times worse.

00:44:28.437 --> 00:44:29.772
This is the only place

00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:34.193
Taejeong Telecom can get a break
from the three major telecoms.

00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:37.280
Can't you let this one go?

00:44:39.865 --> 00:44:44.161
As a senior manager of a small company,
I'm asking you to help us out.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.747
You're from a major corporation.

00:44:48.165 --> 00:44:49.542
Mr. Kim.

00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:51.377
We should head inside.

00:44:55.881 --> 00:44:56.799
Take care.

00:44:58.426 --> 00:44:59.385
Please.

00:45:01.887 --> 00:45:03.597
Is Mr. Heo doing all right?

00:45:04.265 --> 00:45:05.224
I guess.

00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:09.145
What are the chances
of running into him here?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:11.814
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

00:45:13.774 --> 00:45:15.359
Let's not try too hard here.

00:45:16.444 --> 00:45:18.404
We'll just say
what we have to say and leave.

00:45:18.487 --> 00:45:19.905
Of course.

00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:22.450
I told you earlier, remember?

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:24.994
-Right.
-Okay.

00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:27.204
With these strengths,

00:45:27.288 --> 00:45:29.790
we hope ACT can become

00:45:29.874 --> 00:45:32.835
Kukkiwon's most trusted partner.

00:45:32.918 --> 00:45:35.171
That's the end of our presentation.
Thank you.

00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:37.048
Thank you.

00:45:37.131 --> 00:45:38.591
Can you turn on the lights?

00:45:38.674 --> 00:45:41.052
-Please wait a moment.
-Sure.

00:45:41.135 --> 00:45:42.511
Is this all right?

00:45:49.185 --> 00:45:51.812
To be honest,

00:45:51.896 --> 00:45:54.982
we just had a renewal meeting
with Taejeong Telecom,

00:45:55.066 --> 00:45:56.734
which used to be our telecom provider.

00:45:56.817 --> 00:45:57.693
Right.

00:45:57.777 --> 00:46:00.154
We reviewed the quote
you provided us in advance.

00:46:00.237 --> 00:46:03.741
To be honest, it makes more sense
to continue our contract with Taejeong.

00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:06.911
We're not an online-based company,

00:46:06.994 --> 00:46:10.456
and we've maintained our contract
with Taejeong for about ten years.

00:46:10.998 --> 00:46:14.043
We didn't ask for a meeting
to convince you

00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:16.003
to switch to our service straight away.

00:46:16.087 --> 00:46:17.046
But…

00:46:18.255 --> 00:46:21.634
remember how I asked
for a 15-minute break earlier?

00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:23.135
Yes.

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:26.514
We've actually decided to live stream
all the events we host in 4K

00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:29.642
starting from
the second half of this year.

00:46:30.851 --> 00:46:31.936
I see.

00:46:32.019 --> 00:46:35.481
But we were told our existing
data facilities and internet connection

00:46:35.564 --> 00:46:37.983
aren't capable
of handling 4K live streaming.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.779
And it would take ages
for Taejeong to provide

00:46:41.862 --> 00:46:42.947
an OTT solution.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.658
Right. I'm sure that would be the case.

00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:49.537
So could you write up
a new quote for us right now?

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.663
Yes, of course.

00:46:50.746 --> 00:46:52.623
I'll make a request to HQ immediately.

00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:54.291
Let me just grab a few more people.

00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:55.668
Please wait a moment.

00:46:55.751 --> 00:46:56.919
Of course.

00:46:57.795 --> 00:46:58.879
Thank you.

00:47:00.381 --> 00:47:03.050
This is great, sir.

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:06.303
I never expected this.
I'll report this to Mr. Baek.

00:47:06.387 --> 00:47:08.514
No, it's fine. I'll do it myself later.

00:47:08.597 --> 00:47:09.473
Okay.

00:47:09.557 --> 00:47:10.599
Then… Song-hee.

00:47:12.351 --> 00:47:16.897
Song-hee, we're at Kukkiwon.
Can you write up a quote?

00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:19.108
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:47:20.526 --> 00:47:22.611
Team 1 just won
a contract with Kukkiwon.

00:47:22.695 --> 00:47:23.946
He really did it?

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:26.198
Way to go, Mr. Kim.

00:47:26.282 --> 00:47:27.992
And it's the Super Giga Internet Plan.

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:28.951
Right.

00:47:29.034 --> 00:47:31.454
A full turnkey contract
including construction.

00:47:31.537 --> 00:47:32.580
Hang on.

00:47:32.663 --> 00:47:34.540
If it's 50 million a month,
then one year is…

00:47:34.623 --> 00:47:35.666
ESTIMATE

00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:39.295
We won't need to worry
about this year's KPI.

00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:41.088
This will take a weight off his shoulders.

00:47:41.172 --> 00:47:42.798
Right.

00:47:42.882 --> 00:47:45.551
I guess having experience
really does make a difference.

00:47:45.634 --> 00:47:46.886
Right.

00:47:48.345 --> 00:47:49.472
This is incredible.

00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:52.224
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:47:52.308 --> 00:47:53.684
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

00:47:53.767 --> 00:47:54.935
It's not a big deal.

00:48:05.279 --> 00:48:06.238
Hello.

00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:11.076
I hear Team 1 just landed a huge contract.

00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:25.341
Try to put yourself
In my shoes

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:29.762
If you were me
Do you think you could smile?

00:48:30.554 --> 00:48:31.639
You said

00:48:31.722 --> 00:48:35.142
It's so fun driving a manual
after such a long time.

00:48:35.226 --> 00:48:38.270
I think it's my first time
since I finished my military service.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.315
Mr. Kim,

00:48:41.398 --> 00:48:45.110
when I was my commander's driver,
the smooth gear shifting…

00:48:46.737 --> 00:48:48.072
Let's drive quietly.

00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:09.677
All right.

00:49:11.262 --> 00:49:12.680
Oh, I forgot.

00:49:12.763 --> 00:49:15.266
Let's see. The blood is all drained.

00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:16.892
All right.

00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:25.693
Here we go.

00:49:28.862 --> 00:49:30.197
Braised ribs…

00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:31.615
PREPARE THE SAUCE

00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:35.786
Sauce. Eight big scoops of soy sauce.

00:49:36.412 --> 00:49:37.705
Big scoop.

00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:38.664
LIGHT SOY SAUCE

00:49:38.747 --> 00:49:39.999
The soy sauce…

00:49:44.795 --> 00:49:46.046
What is it?

00:49:47.172 --> 00:49:50.676
This is light soy sauce.
You have to add dark soy sauce.

00:49:51.302 --> 00:49:52.595
Are they different?

00:49:52.678 --> 00:49:53.596
Yes.

00:49:53.679 --> 00:49:54.680
Is that so?

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.850
Give it to me. I'll do it.

00:49:57.933 --> 00:49:59.435
All right.

00:49:59.518 --> 00:50:00.978
What?

00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:03.772
You should use a spoon
to measure it, not a ladle.

00:50:03.856 --> 00:50:07.401
Well, it said "big scoop."

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:08.861
-Jeez.
-So do I use a spoon?

00:50:09.945 --> 00:50:12.197
Oh no. Hang on.

00:50:12.698 --> 00:50:14.116
Hey, Su-gyeom.

00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:16.201
Come here and taste the spinach.

00:50:16.285 --> 00:50:19.121
Why are you telling him to taste it?
Try it yourself.

00:50:19.204 --> 00:50:20.956
I can't tell if the seasoning is right.

00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:24.335
Here. Try this.

00:50:26.503 --> 00:50:27.546
How is it?

00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:31.467
Is it that bad?

00:50:32.343 --> 00:50:33.260
Hang on.

00:50:33.344 --> 00:50:35.888
-Move over.
-Oh gosh.

00:50:35.971 --> 00:50:38.098
Why are you so strong?

00:50:38.182 --> 00:50:39.642
-Gosh.
-I'll do it.

00:50:39.725 --> 00:50:41.060
Forget it. I'll do it.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.563
I'll vacuum.

00:50:44.647 --> 00:50:47.900
Hey! What's gotten into you?

00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:49.902
My goodness.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.155
Unbelievable.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.278
PREMIUM KOREAN BEEF GIFT SET

00:51:53.048 --> 00:51:55.008
There's no need for whiskey.

00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:56.468
Beer is enough.

00:51:56.552 --> 00:51:59.304
-Drink that with your wife.
-Here we go.

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:02.057
Thirty years?

00:52:02.141 --> 00:52:04.143
-Nice.
-That's way too much.

00:52:04.226 --> 00:52:06.478
We hardly ever drink anyway.

00:52:06.562 --> 00:52:08.564
-Let me take that.
-My gosh.

00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:10.607
Here you go.

00:52:10.691 --> 00:52:12.651
-All right.
-Oh my.

00:52:12.735 --> 00:52:15.320
-Thank you.
-This smells so nice.

00:52:15.404 --> 00:52:18.031
Here. Have a glass, honey.

00:52:18.115 --> 00:52:20.576
He never listened
when I suggested that we open it.

00:52:20.659 --> 00:52:23.036
I'm finally getting a taste thanks to you.

00:52:24.037 --> 00:52:25.622
You should treat her well.

00:52:25.706 --> 00:52:29.084
I do. What more could I possibly do?

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.211
Let's try it.

00:52:31.295 --> 00:52:33.255
Su-gyeom, would you like a glass too?

00:52:33.338 --> 00:52:34.506
I'll pour you some.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:36.008
Sure, try it.

00:52:36.091 --> 00:52:37.009
Okay.

00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:38.844
You should take it from him.

00:52:38.927 --> 00:52:40.220
My goodness.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.681
This whiskey is older than you.

00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:46.351
You're right.

00:52:49.605 --> 00:52:50.773
All right.

00:52:51.315 --> 00:52:53.233
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

00:52:53.317 --> 00:52:54.693
Why don't you make a toast?

00:52:55.611 --> 00:52:57.404
-Me?
-Yes.

00:52:58.405 --> 00:53:00.491
All right, then.

00:53:02.576 --> 00:53:04.912
First off…

00:53:05.996 --> 00:53:08.207
My love,

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.543
-my sweet deer.
-Oh gosh.

00:53:11.627 --> 00:53:13.754
-My dear Ha-jin.
-Jeez.

00:53:13.837 --> 00:53:16.965
You're my reason for living

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:19.259
Oh gosh. You're being so annoying.
What's with you?

00:53:19.343 --> 00:53:22.513
And our Yonseo University student,

00:53:22.596 --> 00:53:25.265
our pride and joy, Su-gyeom.

00:53:28.227 --> 00:53:32.606
These two are truly
the reasons for my existence.

00:53:32.689 --> 00:53:33.899
-Of course.
-Yes.

00:53:33.982 --> 00:53:39.112
And my mentor, who has taught me
such much ever since I joined ACT,

00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:42.282
our managing director, Baek Jeong-tae!

00:53:42.366 --> 00:53:44.910
-Round of applause!
-Oh, I really…

00:53:46.787 --> 00:53:47.996
Okay, that's enough.

00:53:48.497 --> 00:53:52.918
Seriously, you've truly been
like family for the past 25 years.

00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:55.838
I feel closer to you
than to my own brother.

00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:57.256
You know that, right?

00:53:57.339 --> 00:53:58.215
Of course I do.

00:53:58.841 --> 00:54:01.635
-Right.
-You're not that close with your brother.

00:54:04.596 --> 00:54:08.225
Anyway, what I wanted to say is

00:54:09.059 --> 00:54:11.186
that we're a family.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.565
You know, family means

00:54:14.648 --> 00:54:17.109
sticking together, come rain or shine,

00:54:17.192 --> 00:54:19.486
through fights or laughter.

00:54:20.195 --> 00:54:21.530
We're always together.

00:54:22.197 --> 00:54:26.076
That's what family is. Being together.

00:54:26.159 --> 00:54:29.037
And in the spirit of that, how about

00:54:29.121 --> 00:54:34.501
I say, "Love,"
and you all say, "Together"?

00:54:34.585 --> 00:54:36.503
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Okay, then.

00:54:36.587 --> 00:54:38.005
Love!

00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:40.465
-Together!
-Together!

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:42.175
Hang on.

00:54:42.676 --> 00:54:43.719
My goodness.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.513
Oh my.

00:54:46.597 --> 00:54:47.806
It's starting.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.434
An angel from the skies.

00:54:50.517 --> 00:54:52.477
You're so pretty.

00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:54.438
We're so young, right?

00:54:54.521 --> 00:54:56.648
-How young.
-Seriously.

00:54:56.732 --> 00:54:58.358
You still look the same, Ha-jin.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.154
Look! Back there,
when you were an assistant manager.

00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:05.657
Please welcome Mr. Heo Tae-hwan,

00:55:05.741 --> 00:55:07.534
the groom's friend and colleague.

00:55:08.493 --> 00:55:11.622
I love you

00:55:11.747 --> 00:55:13.832
You're the only one in my world

00:55:13.916 --> 00:55:17.169
-You're so excited!
-I shout your name

00:55:35.145 --> 00:55:37.564
I had such a great meal.

00:55:37.648 --> 00:55:39.107
Oh, right.

00:55:39.816 --> 00:55:41.026
-What is it?
-Su-gyeom.

00:55:42.235 --> 00:55:44.863
-Come on. Don't do this.
-No.

00:55:44.947 --> 00:55:47.866
-Stop.
-This isn't for you anyway.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.368
Don't let your parents take it away.

00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:50.911
-My gosh.
-Oh dear.

00:55:50.994 --> 00:55:52.329
Thank you.

00:55:52.412 --> 00:55:53.497
Wait.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.500
I made some mushroom stir-fry

00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:59.336
and some braised beef
that your wife likes.

00:55:59.419 --> 00:56:02.130
It's seasoned perfectly,
so I'm sure she'll like it.

00:56:02.214 --> 00:56:05.050
-Take these.
-Oh, you shouldn't have.

00:56:05.133 --> 00:56:06.134
Thank you.

00:56:06.218 --> 00:56:07.844
The designated driver can come right away.

00:56:07.928 --> 00:56:09.680
No, could you tell them

00:56:09.763 --> 00:56:11.765
to come in about 15 minutes?

00:56:12.516 --> 00:56:14.226
I'm so full. Let's walk for a bit.

00:56:15.686 --> 00:56:16.812
Okay. Sure.

00:56:17.354 --> 00:56:18.730
Can you come in 15 minutes?

00:56:18.814 --> 00:56:21.525
Ha-jin, I really enjoyed dinner.
You can go back inside.

00:56:21.608 --> 00:56:23.610
Okay. Please come visit again soon.

00:56:23.694 --> 00:56:24.987
-I will.
-Okay.

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.114
Su-gyeom, take your mother inside.

00:56:27.197 --> 00:56:28.782
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:56:28.865 --> 00:56:30.283
-Bye, then.
-I'll take that.

00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:31.910
-Bye.
-Head inside.

00:56:31.994 --> 00:56:33.787
I'll walk him to his car. Go on.

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:36.039
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:56:36.123 --> 00:56:37.791
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:56:38.834 --> 00:56:39.918
Oh my.

00:56:59.312 --> 00:57:01.815
You didn't have to do all this.

00:57:01.898 --> 00:57:03.358
It's nothing.

00:57:03.859 --> 00:57:06.445
Please visit again soon.
It was a lot of fun having you.

00:57:06.528 --> 00:57:08.280
Your wife must have worked so hard.

00:57:10.449 --> 00:57:13.160
And Su-gyeom's all grown up.
He could get married now.

00:57:13.243 --> 00:57:16.121
I'll have to do my best
to support him until then.

00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:18.749
-Jeong-tae.
-Nak-su.

00:57:18.832 --> 00:57:21.460
-Pardon?
-No, go ahead.

00:57:22.753 --> 00:57:24.087
About Kukkiwon.

00:57:24.838 --> 00:57:27.841
You know they were Taejeong's client
for over ten years, right?

00:57:27.924 --> 00:57:29.009
Yes.

00:57:29.092 --> 00:57:30.469
But I went there

00:57:30.552 --> 00:57:34.181
and planted ACT's flag,
and it was at a high price.

00:57:34.264 --> 00:57:35.223
Good job.

00:57:35.307 --> 00:57:38.769
But do you know who went from Taejeong?

00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:42.397
I couldn't believe it.
It was Heo Tae-hwan.

00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:44.733
But do you know what he said to me?

00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:47.319
He begged me not to take their client.

00:57:47.402 --> 00:57:48.487
He pleaded with me,

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.782
saying Taejeong would be ruined
if they lost that client.

00:57:52.407 --> 00:57:55.035
But I didn't hesitate for a single moment.

00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:55.994
Why?

00:57:57.537 --> 00:58:01.625
Because ACT has fed me
and my family for 25 years.

00:58:02.209 --> 00:58:04.169
I'm a proud member of the great ACT.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:09.341
So who cares if my former colleague
dies or gets fired, right?

00:58:09.841 --> 00:58:10.759
Nak-su.

00:58:10.842 --> 00:58:14.304
There's still a long way to go
to repay ACT for everything--

00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:15.680
Kim Nak-su!

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.110
The HR Team is going
to ask to see you tomorrow.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.655
-Jeong-tae.
-It's… going to be--

00:58:31.738 --> 00:58:32.823
Jeong-tae.

00:58:35.534 --> 00:58:37.160
Don't do this to me.

00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:41.373
You know better than anyone
how hard I've worked at ACT

00:58:42.249 --> 00:58:43.458
for the past 25 years.

00:58:43.542 --> 00:58:45.001
You can't do this to me.

00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:48.380
I couldn't attend
any of Su-gyeom's graduations

00:58:49.005 --> 00:58:51.550
because I was always busy
cleaning up your messes.

00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:55.929
I attended your son's
and daughter's graduation ceremonies.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.433
But I never got to attend my own son's.

00:59:01.226 --> 00:59:02.185
Jeong-tae.

00:59:03.895 --> 00:59:05.981
Have I ever once blamed you for that?

00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:09.401
I always took care of the messes you made,

00:59:09.484 --> 00:59:11.319
but I never confronted you about it.

00:59:12.237 --> 00:59:13.864
That's what I did for you.

00:59:14.447 --> 00:59:15.323
Jeong-tae.

00:59:17.617 --> 00:59:19.369
You shouldn't do this to me.

00:59:19.995 --> 00:59:21.288
I'm different from Heo Tae-hwan.

00:59:21.371 --> 00:59:23.248
I was good at my job, and I still am.

00:59:23.331 --> 00:59:24.791
I even landed a big contract.

00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:27.502
I'm still useful to the company.

00:59:30.881 --> 00:59:32.090
You did a good job.

00:59:33.717 --> 00:59:34.759
What?

00:59:36.511 --> 00:59:37.554
Jeong-tae.

00:59:40.932 --> 00:59:42.434
I can still do a good job.

00:59:42.517 --> 00:59:43.935
Nak-su.

00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:45.687
How can you do this to me?

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.107
How can you,
of all people, do this to me?

00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:51.693
What did I do so wrong?

00:59:51.776 --> 00:59:53.612
Are you going to Banpo-dong?

00:59:54.154 --> 00:59:55.322
Yes, that's me.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.366
The black sedan over there.

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.244
Okay. I'll go get the car started, then.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:08.418
I'm sorry.

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.254
Damn it.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:33.735
Damn it.

01:00:40.283 --> 01:00:41.743
Damn it.

Okay.

01:01:19.364 --> 01:01:20.407
It's not working, right?

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.741
We should just let it go.

01:01:21.825 --> 01:01:23.910
We should scrap it now.

01:01:23.994 --> 01:01:25.662
-Okay.
-Let's take a photo.

01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:36.464
TO BE SCRAPPED

01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:49.144
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:01.614

THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:48.096
Why would the Safety and Health Manager
have to do something like this?

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:49.931
Lunchtime!

01:03:52.475 --> 01:03:57.230
I've worked at ACT for 25 years.
That's 25 years!

01:03:58.356 --> 01:04:00.024
What are you doing?
I can't do this anymore.

01:04:00.108 --> 01:04:02.485
-So you're quitting?
-Yes!

01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:04.070
You're the one who said

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:06.489
we must take
responsibility for our choices.

01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:09.075
-Check, check… safety!
-Safety, safety, safety!

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:10.243
All good!

01:04:10.326 --> 01:04:12.787
Let's see how well you can handle

01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:15.665
the ACT Sales Team
floundering without Kim Nak-su!

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:19.586
Just keep a low profile

01:04:19.669 --> 01:04:22.422
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.

01:04:22.495 --> 01:04:24.495
