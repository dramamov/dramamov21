[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.410
[Episode 20]

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.330
Why didn't you just tell your sister that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.920
you were only able to kill
that old bastard, Qianji City Lord,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.160
because of me?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.880
As long as my sister can stay,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.720
what's the harm in telling a little lie?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.520
Your sister is not a fool.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.020
With your petty tricks alone,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.600
she won't

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.200
stay by your side forever.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.400
Then I'll do whatever it takes

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.680
to cut off every possibility
of her leaving me.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.770
Are you alright?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.660
Keep up, everyone.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.310
Let's go home early.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.320
-Sandstorm Town is right ahead.
-Thank you, savior.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.440
Thank you, savior.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.079
Thank you, savior.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:30.640
Thank you.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.760
Thank you, savior.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.320
Thank you, savior.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.720
Thank you.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.840
Thank you, savior.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.770
Savior, aren't you coming with us?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.200
I'm not.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.730
I still have to go

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.260
save my little poor dog.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.600
Higher.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.400
Harder.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.160
Comfortable.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.130
It'll be more comfortable
if you go higher.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Massage here.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.360
Boy,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.600
you're great in every way,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.640
except you're wearing too many layers.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.600
Aren't you hot?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.280
Take it off.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.560
Why are you wearing it?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.640
I'm not here to massage your legs.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.770
I'm here to get the Water-Control Orb.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.320
What?

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.560
According to our tradition,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.040
I should use some

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.370
sneaky and cunning tricks to take it back.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.520
Where is the Water-Control Orb?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.120
Say that again.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.000
That's the sacred relic of our clan.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.660
You'd better give it to me now.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.240
I don't want to use force.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240
It's not right for a man to hit a woman.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.120
Insolent fool!

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880
You audacious villain!

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.600
Stop!

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.600
Stand behind me.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800
How dare you lay your hand on someone

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.740
from my, Li Xueyang's territory?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.620
You're Li Xueyang?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.960
Little girl.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.159
So what if I do?

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.440
What can you do to me?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.040
Your abilities

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.080
don't match your arrogance.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.840
Anyone who underestimates me

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.880
will die!

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.560
Wind Stabilize! Vajra!

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.710
Thunder! Lightning!

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.280
She really has the Water-Control Orb.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.950
It looks like she can't consume it

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.320
and can only use it as a magic tool.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.480
For now,
I should deal with this female bandit

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.080
before doing anything else.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.170
Poor dog!

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520
If you want to save her,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.380
turn your demon power into blood!

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.070
My Water-Control Orb!

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.230
Poor dog.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.140
Spit it out.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.120
Come on.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.240
Poor dog,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.280
spit it out.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.680
Hurry.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.520
Be good.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.120
Go!

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.000
Go!

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.240
Hurry up!

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.760
Sir,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.780
have we met before?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.560
Yes, we have.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.760
I'm

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.210
Lantern Wang from Sandstorm Town.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.880
You're more than just a lantern maker,
aren't you?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.400
The Western Regions
are full of all kinds of demons

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.659
and are never at peace.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.480
The Li Army needs talent.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.630
Sir, would you like to join the Li Army?

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.610
No need.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.000
My poor dog

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.840
and I

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.360
stick together.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.400
Me!

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.520
I'm willing to join the Li Army.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.170
How could the Second Prince
of Corsac Fox State

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.560
join the Li Army?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.370
Prince Yunfei, please don't joke.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.090
Greetings, General Li.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.520
Greetings, Imperial Preceptor.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.120
So you're the Second Prince
of Corsac Fox State.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.200
Just now, the Second Prince

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
accidentally swallowed
an unknown magic tool.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.280
Imperial Preceptor, please be careful.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.880
Alright.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.140
Thank you for your concern, General.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.880
Mr. Wang,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.440
see you.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.400
See you.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440
Take all these bandits

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.720
back to the military camp
to deal with them.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.380
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.240
Li Xueyang,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.679
see you!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.480
So, you're the Second Prince

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.740
of Corsac Fox State,
the one who left your country and home.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.240
Yes.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.840
My name is Fan Yunfei.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.360
Second Prince, congratulations
on reclaiming the Water-Control Orb

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.890
and returning victorious.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.000
This Lantern Wang
is a friend of mine from Sandstorm Town.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.530
I want him to go back with me.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.790
No problem.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.960
As long as you come back with me,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.620
you can bring anyone you like.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.300
I'll take you to see my father.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.880
Is that really appropriate?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.680
What's inappropriate about it?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.080
The dragon carvings in your country...

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.360
are quite unique.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.520
This place

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.240
used to be the royal palace
of the dragon clan.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.100
These are dragon totems up there.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.760
Nonsense.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.210
That's a corsac fox.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.250
A corsac fox.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.660
So it's a corsac fox
with the body of a dragon?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.080
Sir, you may not know,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.600
but the Western Regions used to be
occupied by a group of dragon demons.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.480
Later, due to the wars,
the dragon demons declined,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.400
and our diligent Corsac Fox Clan
seized the opportunity,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.480
worked tirelessly,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.360
and rose

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.320
to this unprecedented glory.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.680
The Elder of the Corsac Fox Clan is here!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.560
Elder Lou.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.400
Prince Yunfei, don't move.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.840
Elder Lou,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.800
you've been listening for a long time.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.920
Any conclusions?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.840
Your Majesty,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.720
I didn't hear anything.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.680
Isn't your left ear deaf?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.320
So-sorry.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.840
Sorry.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.400
Your Majesty,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.900
there is indeed something
in Prince Yunfei's stomach,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.140
but I cannot be sure

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.970
if it's the Water-Control Orb.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.330
How can you not be sure about it?

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.480
This Mr. Wang from Sandstorm Town

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
is a witness.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.680
Mr. Wang,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.760
am I right?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.360
Anyway,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.560
Prince Yunfei
reclaimed the Water-Control Orb

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.680
and achieved great merit.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.960
According to Heaven's will,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.480
he should inherit the throne.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.080
Wait.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.920
Prince Yunfei
swallowed the Water-Control Orb.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.360
He's clueless

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.930
and simple-minded.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.160
How can he ascend the throne?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.720
This is the emperor's decree.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.920
This is the emperor's decree!

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.080
The emperor's decree?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.010
The Elders Council doesn't agree.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.320
You'll incur Heaven's wrath

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360
for ignoring the emperor's decree!

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.840
Given the current situation,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.440
forcibly removing the Water-Control Orb

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.400
might hurt the poor dog.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.320
Fine.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.360
Before we find a way
to remove the Water-Control Orb,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.620
I'll help him a little.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.700
Prince Yunfei,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.920
come here.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.680
Your Majesty!

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.940
Prince Yunfei does have demon power;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.480
he just

doesn't know how to use it yet.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.080
Yes, yes.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.010
You all saw that, right?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.080
Well... Lantern...

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.160
Wang,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.100
how did you manage to do it?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.640
I pierced his Lingtai acupoint

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.840
to forcefully trigger his demon power.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.480
This method is bad for his health

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.810
and can't be used often.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.840
Why?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.400
Your Majesty,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.360
if Mr. Wang
can serve as the Prince's tutor,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.860
the Elders Council

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.320
is willing to yield.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.160
Yes.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.200
I refuse.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.460
I'll take my leave.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.320
Wait.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.680
Everyone,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600
you may leave now.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.120
I want to have a proper talk

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.200
with Mr. Wang.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.890
After all this time,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.620
the Silk Cave still hasn't sent any news.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.450
Qingcheng said he'd go to look into it,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.100
but he hasn't brought back
anything useful.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.360
Looks like I need to find a way

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.080
to go out to find Young Master Fugui
myself.

Qingcheng?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.720
How is it?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.290
We have confirmed news about the Soldier.

[Tomb of the Soldier, Wangquan Fugui]

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.460
With just a pile of soil

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.640
and a memorial tablet here,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.440
you expect me to believe

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.770
Young Master Fugui is buried underneath?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.060
I don't believe it.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.600
I want to see him alive or dead!

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.340
Unless I see Young Master Fugui's body
with my own eyes,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.360
I won't believe it.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.890
This is just a cenotaph.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.080
It was set up by that man named Quan Rumu.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.520
Yiqi Alliance forbade the Soldier from
entering the ancestral hall after death.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.180
They said he was an ominous man

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.400
and abandoned his corpse in the wild

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.400
to be torn

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.080

and beasts.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.600
Where is Young Master Rumu?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440
Where is he?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.040
Before the Soldier died,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.540
his sword meridian was extracted

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.370
and transplanted into this

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.890
Young Master Rumu you just mentioned.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.650
He succeeded him as the Soldier

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.360
in Wangquan Manor.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.080

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.260
go back and wait for me.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.570
I'll go find him.

Sister!

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.600
Sister, don't you understand?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.800
This is human nature.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.680
Who wouldn't fear

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.080
an uncontrolled Soldier?

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.480
That so‑called prophecy is just an excuse.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.760
Sister,

face reality

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.280
and give up the idea
of living in harmony with humans.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.440
Go back with me now.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.290
Let's go.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.680
I told you!

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.520
I want to see him alive or dead!

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.780
Even if this is true,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.800
I will make them pay

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.000
pay with their blood!

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.040
Let go of me!

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.090
Let go of me!

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.410
Sister, do you love him so much?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.360
He's a Soldier.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.070
He killed countless demons.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.520
You can't even get away from me,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.120
and you want to go to Wangquan Manor
to get yourself killed?

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.050
The Soldier killed so many demons.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.280
Even his own people didn't spare him.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.740
This was his retribution.

I'm sorry.

I know you want revenge,

but you must get well...

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.960
little command
of demon power since childhood.

Although he is a prince
of the Western Regions,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.460
his entire clan
has discriminated against him.

he can inherit the throne.

in the Water-Control Orb.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.560
I left the palace because of my brother.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.960
I remember the wind was fierce that day.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.120
When I found her in the desert,

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.090
she was almost frozen.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.680
I tried to wake her up,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.640
but she held onto me tightly
and wouldn't let go.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.400
Actually, I've been looked down on
since I was a child.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.200
That was the first time in my life

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.530
I knew what it felt like to be needed.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.280
So when the sandstorm came,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.940
only one thought remained in my mind—

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.250
I must protect her at all costs.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.640
In that desperate moment,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.120
my demon power surged,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.000
and I somehow unleashed strength

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.240
I'd never had before.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.780
That helped us escape that disaster.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.260
She was the first person I ever saved,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.120
and it was also the bravest thing
I've ever done.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.280
But the next morning,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.640
when I went to fetch her some water,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.160
she was gone.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.170
I don't really understand.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.320
Now,

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.720
whenever I think of her,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.250
my heart beats really fast.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.880
Master,

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.480
do you think I...

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.440
like her?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.640
I'm not sure.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.160
But when it comes to love,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.440
it has to go both ways.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:26.880
Um...

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.520
It's okay.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.800
Once I regain my true form

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.240
and give her some

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.080
strong, vivid impressions,

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.540
she will definitely fall in love with me.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.920
Yes.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.040
You can...

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.320
try it.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.210
Alright!

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.770
I'll go give it a try.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.600
Wait for my good news!

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.320
Okay.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.340
What a silly dog...

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.720
Since the poor dog
absorbed the Water-Control Orb,

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.650
I'll have to stay by his side for now

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.600
and find a way to remove it later.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.460
And this King of Corsac Fox State.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.160
He may look clumsy and silly,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.720
but for him to have survived this long,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.400
that can't just be a miracle.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.520
Anyway,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.360
Master of Corsac Fox State—
it sounds better.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.180
It's better than Lantern Wang.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.830
[Li Army Camp]

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.040
Bravo!

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.720
Bing, are you embarrassed?

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.360
Practice more.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.600
Black, White, you two go.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.640
Bravo!

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.480
Bravo! Bravo!

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.600
General,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.200
there's a corsac fox outside
asking to see you.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.720
It's you?

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.370
Are you feeling better now?

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.280
Yes, mu-much better.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.490
What are you doing here?

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.400
I'm here

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.290
to bring you something.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.720
Thank you for saving me last time.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.560
I don't accept rewards
for what I should do.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.710
I saved you
because it was the right thing to do.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.600
Take it back.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.000
Wait!

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.040
You...

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.690
Are you feeling unwell?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:50.920
General,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.360
he's provoking you.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.420
Since it's a provocation,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.700
don't blame me for being rude.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960
He's not down yet?

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.600
He's got a nice face,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.740
but it's a pity he's a fool.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.560
Watching him get beaten

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.290
actually puts me in a good mood.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.000
-Boss!
-What kind of mindset is that?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.600
Boss!

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.280
Here.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.280
Take a look.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.480
How is it?

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.680
Wow.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.450
Smells good.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.490
It's Tianwang Duck Soup from the Yu's.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:47.390
Try it.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.870
Try it.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:53.920
Good.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.640
By the way,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.960
did you go to

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.620
suppress the bandits alone again
a few days ago?

[Mrs. Li]

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.680
Have you forgotten
what happened 3 years ago,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.880
when you went to slay demons by yourself,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.840
got seriously injured,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.570
and lost your way in the desert?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.060
Mother,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.880
didn't you later give me those nine

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.880
Heavenly Cold Jade Talismans?

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.200
Ever since then,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.000
I've never made you worry again.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.320
Yes.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.200
You.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.020
My wife really is impressive.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880
Oh right, Father,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.200
have you found the person who saved me

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.530
in the desert last time?

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.660
That reminds me, Daughter.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.040
You should at least tell me

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.120
whether our benefactor

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.680
is tall or short,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.040
fat or thin—

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.380
what does he look like?

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.320
You need to be specific.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:38.880
Yes.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.640
How am I supposed to find him?

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.960
All I remember is that

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.400
the person was furry.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.920
It was very comfortable.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.560
Furry?

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.120
Humans have their own ways
of getting along.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.480
You can't just show your true self

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.940
and expect to be accepted.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.600
Besides,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.640
you have the Water-Control Orb inside you

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.900
and your demon power is uncontrollable.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.880
You were lucky

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.320
not to make a fool of yourself
in front of her.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.360
Can you help me

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.400
remove this orb?

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.040
Sure.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400
As long as

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.860
you practice diligently.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.200
Master.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.000

Do you have someone you like?

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.360
Can you teach me

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.160
how to win her over?

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.680
What's wrong?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.880
Nothing.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.400
I just suddenly

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.130
thought of someone.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.560
Who is it?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.680
All of these?

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.480
Yes.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.840
Qianji City is the last place

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.240
lacking cultivation secrets and manuals.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.480
If you think these are not enough,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.680
I can go look for more.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.460
Does your face still hurt?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.840
I shouldn't have slapped you yesterday.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.280
I lost my temper.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.720
I'm sorry.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.280
Sister,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.040
I just hope

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.840
that if one day I die,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.500
you'll be this sad too.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.160
Don't talk nonsense.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.280
Our Qingcheng

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.920
will live a long life.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.600
Yes.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.880
I'll always be with you.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.680
I used to think

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.180
I could always
stay with Young Master Fugui too,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.320
but Qingcheng was right.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.920
Right now,

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.970
my power and magic are weak.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.490
In front of Yiqi Alliance,
I'm like an ant.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.840
Even if I go,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.100
how could I uncover the truth?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.960
If Young Master Fugui were really gone,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.000
how could I ever personally avenge him?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.620
Only by possessing powerful demon power

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.360
will I not be as helpless as I am now

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.160
in future dangers

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.180
and will be able to protect

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.850
those I want to protect.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.600
It's said that the demon king
spent many years cultivating

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.060
before reaching mastery.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.200
But since there exists the Buddhist path
of sudden enlightenment,

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.880
there should also be a demon's path
of burning heart and refining bones,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.240
allowing me to achieve mastery swiftly.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.560
Why do I feel my demon power weakening

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.690
the more I practice these techniques?

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.730
Perhaps I've been too eager
for quick success
