00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.960
I don't want to be his mentor, either.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.190
What's wrong with you two?

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.840
Let me tell you both.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.670
This is how it's going to be.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.150
Stop arguing.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.320
If you don't like it,

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.280
you can quit being patrol cops.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.970
Well...

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:25.840
You...

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.440
Mr. Qin.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.920
You're late today.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.670
Perfect timing.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.470
Freshly made.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.960
Here, Beiping brought it for you.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.920
Here we go again.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.180
You're being too kind.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.370
Well, thank you.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.320
The new colleague?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:52.630
Come.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.760
Join us for the meal.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.670
There's enough. I'll cook more.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.590
Thank you. But I'll pass.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.390
Don't bother if he's not eating.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.880
How are these dumplings?

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.890
Very delicious.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.820
By the way, Ran.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.750
Yesterday I passed by that small hostel.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.760
It's a mess again
with all those people staying there.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.220
It's really troublesome.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.590
The surrounding area is being demolished.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.760
It was already chaotic.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.440
Don't worry.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.760
I'll check it out tonight.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.590
Why not go now?

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.910
What place he mentioned?

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.890
The hostel.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.550
Yes.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.590
Would anyone be at the hostel
during the day?

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.630
Who would hang around there
in broad daylight?

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.160
Exactly.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.300
Use your brain.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.480
Officer Ran?

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.920
Open for business again?

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.720
Thanks to you.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.030
But now I'm

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.160
operating legally.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.060
I have a license there.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.510
Business licenses aren't my concern.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.710
I just want to ask you—

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.260
How many people are staying here?

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.030
Not many.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.710
Do they have temporary residence permits?

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.280
Do the man and woman living together

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.670
have a marriage certificate?

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.930
Yes, yes. They got them from the station.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:53.880
What?

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.510
They really do have them.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:57.690
Fine.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.840
I got it.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.490
Let's go.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:02.840
[Hostel]

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.590
Take care.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.220
I could rush in.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.060
[Hostel]

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.620
Are we making arrests?

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.110
If you think you can handle
all those people,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.080
then go ahead.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.960
Stop!

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:35.840
Police!

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.520
Don't run!

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:37.920
[Hostel]

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.380
Stop running! Don't move!

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.370
Don't move!

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.360
Stop!

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.960
[Hostel]

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.490
Get down!

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.580
Don't move!

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:46.600
Get down!

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.730
Ran,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840
that was sneaky.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.550
You said everyone had permits.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.270
Why run?

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:52.600
I'm begging you.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.810
Please let me go.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.850
Ran.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.920
That girl from the bun shop

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.070
really is not here.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.230
If I ever see her,

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.960
I'll call you right away, okay?

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.920
You'd better remember that.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.880
Yes.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:13.550
[Hostel]

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.550
[Come to Zilaishui Hutong, Zhang.]

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.910
Over here! Over here!

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.140
Ran, over here!

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:28.840
What's going on?

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.670
She must have been scared by the dog.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.280
She was like this when I arrived.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.000
You don't know that.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.320
She's terrified of dogs.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.520
Ma'am, what's wrong?

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.070
That's enough.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.110
She needs to rest for a while.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.440
You should go check on that dog first.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.760
Don't let it run away again.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.110
Okay.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.030
Please keep an eye on her for me.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.320
Be careful with that dog.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.920
Don't worry.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.670
Don't get bitten.
