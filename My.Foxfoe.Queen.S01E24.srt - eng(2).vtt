00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.100
Really?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.180
Yes.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.380
Of course.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.260
Mother.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.060
Heng.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.980
Come to me.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.660
Don't cry, Heng.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.860
Mother.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.580
Mother.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.860
Heng.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.540
Mother.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.460
Heng.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.860
Hold me, Mother.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.140
After all these years,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.620
I can finally hold you again, Mother.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.140
Heng!

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.700
Heng!

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.100
Heng!

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.340
Xuan.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.539
Come.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.860
Xuan.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.580
I wish we could go back

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.380
to when we were young and carefree.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.340
Your Majesty.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.300
We must face the mistakes

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.060
we've made.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.660
Yes.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.220
I am sorry.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.460
Your Majesty.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.500
Your Majesty.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.300
Your Majesty.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.980
Heng.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.380
Heng.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.820
I offer my soul as sacrifice.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.500
Let the dark spirits return.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.820
Let the evil demon descend.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.460
Let all living beings turn to ash.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.940
This entire world

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.019
will become my Heng's

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.660
burial ground.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.620
Yaya!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.060
Yaya!

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.380
Yaya...

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.420
So this is

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.860
what it feels like to have a body again.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.340
It feels incredible.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.619
You...

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.459
What...

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.660
Who are you?

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.339
It seems the Phoenix
kept me sealed for too long.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.140
The world has forgotten my name.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.779
You...

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.020
You are...

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.660
Ying Zhao.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.099
You actually know my name.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.300
Then, you're not
as ignorant as I thought.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.460
What do you want?

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.820
Why are you taking over his body?

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.460
His body?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.740
No.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.300
This is what the Phoenix owes me.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.539
I'm only taking back what was mine.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.660
Yue.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.580
Yue!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.820
He still carries
so many unfulfilled obsessions.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.260
But that doesn't matter now.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.820
This body belongs to me.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.180
And I'll use it

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.460
to shake heaven and earth.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.099
I won't let you succeed.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.060
Do you even know what you're facing?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.179
Your weak demon power

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.660
is nothing but dust before me.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.420
As I am now,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.460
I could crush you in a heartbeat.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.180
I...

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.260
I'll never let you win.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.780
Your courage

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.900
surprises me.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.300
Then, show me.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.860
Let's see how long you can survive

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.260
in this world of chaos.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.620
(The Phoenix used the Divine Phoenix Sword
to defeat Ying Zhao.)

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.260
(Maybe I can use it)

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.860
(to bring Yaya back.)

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.860
What's this?

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.179
Not a single living soul around.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.620
Feeling lonely?

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.220
Is that why you came to talk to me?

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.700
Ying Zhao,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.900
after all the lives you've destroyed,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.220
don't you feel any remorse?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.460
Remorse?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.100
That's nothing
but the hypocrisy of the weak.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.300
I abandoned
such worthless feelings long ago.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.660
Listen.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.380
Do you hear this silence?

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.700
This is what the world truly looks like.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.140
This is what real

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.700
harmony and nature sound like.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.420
Yaya.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.339
I know you're still in there.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.339
Wake up, please.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.659
Don't let Ying Zhao control you.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.660
Save your breath.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.420
He's long gone.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.220
This body

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.020
belongs to me.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.739
I'm taking a nap.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.420
Not in the mood to kill.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.420
Now get lost.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.740
Yaya.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.179
Yaya!

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.660
Wake up, come on, wake up!

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.220
You are too noisy.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.700
Huh.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.420
So it's the Divine Phoenix Sword.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.220
No wonder you're feeling confident.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.180
But do you really think

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.420
you can defeat me with that sword?

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.060
If I don't try,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.700
how will I know?

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.660
Yaya.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.820
Wake up.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.420
It's me.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.659
It's me, Yue.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.019
Yaya!

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.580
(Yaya, please wake up!)

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.460
(It's Yue!)

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.500
(Yaya!)

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.380
Yue...

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.820
Yue?

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.260
Yue?

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.700
Yue?

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.100
Where am I?

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.699
(This is the cage I created)

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.620
(for your consciousness.)

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.899
(How is it? Do you like it?)

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.099
Who are you?

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.059
(Who am I?)

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.940
(Who am I?)

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.579
(Have you remembered now?)

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.060
You're Ying Zhao.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.139
I won't let you use me
as your instrument of destruction!

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.019
(Destruction?)

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.259
(No.)

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.380
(I intend to rebuild it.)

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.139
(To rebuild this world
that's been rotted and weakened.)

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.499
(And you,)

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.660
(you will be my vessel.)

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.899
(But don't worry.)

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.859
(I'll give you power.)

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.099
(You'll become the undying ruler)

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.860
(of this new world.)

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.300
I know the two of you tried your best.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.699
But this is where it ends.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.820
All that effort means nothing.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.020
Now die.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.380
Yue.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.620
I won't let you die.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.220
(How can this be?)

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.939
(How do you possess such power?)

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.379
Because

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.620
there's someone I have to protect.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.420
Die.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.420
Yue.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.979
Yaya.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.100
It's me.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.180
I've taken back control for now.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.500
Yaya.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.100
Kill me.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.460
Hurry, kill me.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.899
No, Yaya.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.099
You have to kill me.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.100
It's the only way to end this.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.660
I can't.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.700
Yue.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.379
My hands

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.220
are already stained with sin.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.660
Now

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.260
so many innocent lives
have died because of me.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.139
Only my death

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.060
can atone for that.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.459
No, Yaya, don't.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.380
Do it.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.260
Before Ying Zhao takes my body again.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.260
Hurry.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.580
Do it!

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.500
Yaya!

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.180
Yue.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.060
You've done this before.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.220
This is the only way.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.620
For all living beings,

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.620
and for me.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.500
Yue.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:01.980
Do it.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.260
Yaya.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.820
Please.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.700
Do it.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.699
(What have you done?)

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.220
(I don't want to die.)

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.820
(I don't want to die!)

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.940
