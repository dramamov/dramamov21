00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.720
I already paid off your debt at the den, Bua.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.203
Why don’t you just make Bo your wife?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.425
That debt you paid for me…

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.035
I’ll take it as the dowry.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:48.192
Good morning.

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.038
My name is…

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:50.616
Bonita Piansakul.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:52.307
I’m a second-year student in the Faculty of Economics.

00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:54.800
Jumping into someone else’s car like this…

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.242
Do you think it’s the right thing to do?

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:58.335
You’d better have a good reason, Babe.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.109
Could you drop me off at the university gate, please?

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:06.295
Let me ask you something.

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:08.531
Why don’t you want to go home?

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:10.800
It’s not that I don’t want to.

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:12.177
But I just can’t.

00:02:15.863 --> 00:02:16.760
Why are you smiling?!

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:18.007
Come here!

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:20.982
We should get out of here.

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:29.064
Queen.

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:31.378
I’m not joking.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:33.508
I won’t allow that.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:35.929
I’m serious.

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:40.135
So am I.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.621
You’re defying me.

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.489
I could defy you even more.

00:02:58.763 --> 00:02:59.770
(Where are they?!)

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.561
(Just keep looking!)

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.863
Where are you going?

00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:16.666
You wouldn’t listen to me.

00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:19.372
I thought you were different.

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:21.880
I thought you were better than those people.

00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:24.757
But in the end…

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:27.907
You’re no different from them.

00:04:42.608 --> 00:04:43.301
Check out this one.

00:04:44.373 --> 00:04:45.000
This one?

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:45.969
Yeah, that one.

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:49.462
What are you guys up to?

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:50.730
We’re just hanging out!

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.041
Who sent you here?

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.713
What?! I said we were just hanging out!

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.000
Go buy yourself a new one.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.160
And this, it’s mine now.

00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:19.263
Back off!

00:05:22.494 --> 00:05:23.814
And tell your boss this…

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.233
Stay away from my boss.

00:05:27.383 --> 00:05:28.129
Get lost!

00:05:35.712 --> 00:05:37.085
What were you guys doing?!

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:38.324
(I’m sorry, Boss.)

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:43.042
Did you get the photos?

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:44.520
(They took the phone.)

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:46.181
(All the photos are in there.)

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:54.328
Kongtup.

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:57.480
If you want to take Queen down…

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:58.667
You have to outsmart her.

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:11.533
I've found her weakness.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.140
And I know exactly how to make use of it.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:32.816
Bo!

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:34.800
What happened to your lips?!

00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:36.487
Who did this?!

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:37.729
I’ll deal with them!

00:06:38.408 --> 00:06:40.000
It’s alright, I already took care of it.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.360
You can’t let this go! We’ve got strict rules here.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:45.113
I’ll clear this up for you.

00:06:45.662 --> 00:06:46.800
Fern needs to know about it.

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:48.653
Mint!

00:06:49.332 --> 00:06:50.000
Don’t!

00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:51.241
I’m fine.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:53.737
I don’t want to make it a big deal.

00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:58.412
I’m serious.

00:07:19.353 --> 00:07:20.360
(You wouldn’t listen to me.)

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.440
(I thought you were different…)

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.024
(I thought you were better than those people.)

00:07:24.024 --> 00:07:25.388
(But in the end…)

00:07:25.388 --> 00:07:27.674
You’re no different from them.

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:38.784
Are you okay, Queen?!

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:41.020
Did you take care of everything already?!

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.699
Yes, King.

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:48.694
Kongtup’s already making his move.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.399
You’ll have to be even more careful from now on.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.817
This is no big deal.

00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.583
I can handle everything.

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:06.536
I know you can, Queen.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.385
But Kongtup’s not going to stop there.

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:13.639
I know.

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:17.678
But there can only be one winner.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:26.555
(They said I’m your weak spot.)

00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.503
(I don’t know what that means.)

00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:37.327
What’s on your mind, Queen?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.235
Nothing.

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:50.122
For the meeting tomorrow…

00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:54.082
The board will definitely ask about the site for our new project.

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:56.213
I will not use that area.

00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:58.709
I’ll present a new proposal.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.239
I agree with you on this.

00:09:04.363 --> 00:09:08.192
There are many other sites where we could build our new project.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.761
Are you ready, Queen?

00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:15.000
Yes.

00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:18.557
I’ve prepared everything for tomorrow’s meeting.

00:09:34.427 --> 00:09:35.251
What is it?

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.683
What’s wrong with you?

00:09:41.258 --> 00:09:42.631
Drinking all day…

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.200
And slacking off like this.

00:09:50.452 --> 00:09:51.799
I hired you to work.

00:09:52.975 --> 00:09:55.149
Not to sit around like an idiot.

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.955
I think I’ve warned you before.

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:09.721
About Bua’s daughter.

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:12.414
If you’d listened to me from the start…

00:10:13.224 --> 00:10:16.217
She would’ve been yours by now.

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.260
For a girl like that…

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:19.706
She’s all about the money.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.941
Just like her mother.

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:28.842
A cheap girl like that...

00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:31.364
How many men do you think she’s been through before you?

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:39.895
It's none of your business!

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:42.776
Alright!

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:43.905
I know.

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:46.843
I was just messing with you.

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:48.773
Let me warn you.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.975
Don’t you ever talk about Bo like that again.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:55.308
Or I’ll put a bullet in your head.

00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:00.470
Alright, I get it.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.112
I was only teasing.

00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:08.223
Now give me my gun back.

00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:09.060
Please?

00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:14.561
Please?

00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:35.129
You’re going to be done for, Kem.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:48.640
For today’s agenda…

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.223
I’d like to discuss the site for our new project.

00:11:53.105 --> 00:11:54.791
I would like to propose a new location…

00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:57.994
To replace the current site in the slum area.

00:11:58.409 --> 00:12:00.226
I believe that site…

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.872
isn’t suitable for our new project at this stage.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.160
Not suitable? In what way, Keeraphat?

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:09.702
That site is right in the city center.

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.960
With convenient access to transportation.

00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:15.000
Why risk a new site?

00:12:15.897 --> 00:12:17.505
When we already have a prime one in hand.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.607
It’s a matter of timing, Songpol.

00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:22.680
I don’t think it’s suitable yet.

00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:27.796
And also, the issues that follow would only delay the process.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:34.655
In which the delay comes from negotiating with residents to reclaim the land.

00:12:35.282 --> 00:12:36.367
How is that difficult?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.920
Just use the law to move them out.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.961
Do you really think it’s that simple, Songpol?

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.118
Of course it is.

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.400
It’s just a minor relocation issue.

00:12:48.588 --> 00:12:49.595
That’s it.

00:12:51.482 --> 00:12:53.064
According to the data I have.

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:56.214
This community covers 41 rai.

00:12:56.798 --> 00:13:00.000
With more than 1,800 households.

00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:01.687
Over 8,000 people.

00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:07.242
What makes negotiations most difficult is their deep attachment to the land.

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:10.624
If we rely only on the law…

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:15.291
I don’t believe we could relocate them within one or two years.

00:13:16.868 --> 00:13:19.720
It’s an ideal site, Keeraphat.

00:13:20.001 --> 00:13:22.720
It’s spacious and perfect for the project.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.555
Especially, it’s right in the city center.

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:31.547
It should be developed like the surrounding areas.

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:35.760
Not left as a blind spot.

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.552
I still insist…

00:13:40.624 --> 00:13:42.624
we can resolve this legally.

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.159
The law has its limits.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:49.872
And so should those who use it.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.150
If the residents resist and protest.

00:13:54.828 --> 00:13:57.115
Our company’s reputation could be at risk.

00:13:57.474 --> 00:13:58.376
Moreover…

00:13:58.376 --> 00:14:02.791
The site I’m about to propose is just as suitable.

00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:06.934
It’s an open space…

00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:09.901
That requires no demolition.

00:14:10.546 --> 00:14:12.677
It also has convenient transportation access.

00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:15.827
The only drawback is…

00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:17.801
It’s not in the city center.

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:28.302
What’s everyone’s opinion on this?

00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:30.563
I agree with Songpol.

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:34.710
This new project should be built on that site only.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.114
I don’t think we need another location.

00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:39.367
I agree with Keeraphat.

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:44.526
The biggest problem with that site is the residents.

00:14:44.526 --> 00:14:46.992
Solving it would be complicated.

00:14:46.992 --> 00:14:49.700
And the new project would be delayed.

00:14:51.862 --> 00:14:53.287
Then why don’t we hold a vote?

00:14:54.202 --> 00:14:55.235
In the next meeting.

00:14:55.784 --> 00:14:57.418
Why not today?

00:14:58.463 --> 00:15:00.463
I’ve already prepared all the data.

00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.840
Why be in such a hurry, Keeraphat?

00:15:06.094 --> 00:15:08.956
Give the board some time to gather information and decide.

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:12.054
Then we can vote in the next meeting.

00:15:17.178 --> 00:15:19.178
If that’s the case, I have no objection.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:21.465
This meeting is concluded.

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:49.296
Songpol!

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:51.524
May I have a word with you, Keeraphat?

00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:57.742
Please, have a seat.

00:15:59.003 --> 00:15:59.971
Do you know why…

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:03.435
you’re not fit to be president?

00:16:07.694 --> 00:16:08.471
Why is that?

00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:10.847
Because you’re different from your father.

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:13.306
Jenphop…

00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:16.227
Always put the company’s interests first.

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:18.251
But you…

00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:22.668
Even knowing how much profit the company would gain from that land.

00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:24.909
Still insist on finding a replacement site.

00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:30.000
This is not a charity, Keeraphat.

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.165
You don’t need to protect those people.

00:16:37.212 --> 00:16:38.723
Why don’t you go into politics instead?

00:16:41.138 --> 00:16:42.567
That way you could truly work for the people.

00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:49.129
That’s not what I have in mind.

00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:52.919
I just don’t want to exploit anyone.

00:16:54.031 --> 00:16:55.548
When they’ve done nothing wrong.

00:16:57.764 --> 00:16:59.764
Just be direct, Keeraphat.

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:02.494
Everyone knows it.

00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:06.095
The reason you won’t relocate the villagers…

00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:09.859
is because you’re afraid it will affect Wasin’s election, isn’t that right?

00:17:11.975 --> 00:17:13.622
That district belongs to Wasin.

00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:17.467
There are thousands of people there.

00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:20.632
That’s no small number of votes.

00:17:24.195 --> 00:17:25.597
Think whatever you like.

00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:32.102
I only came by to give you a little reminder.

00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:35.784
I don’t want to see your efforts go to waste.

00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.018
Did Songpol come to see you?!

00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:00.417
Yes.

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:02.851
It seems he won’t give up that easily.

00:18:03.662 --> 00:18:06.668
He’ll do whatever it takes to push that project through in that area.

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:10.948
I think he might’ve made a deal under the table with those construction companies.

00:18:12.918 --> 00:18:13.940
Anyway, forget about that for now.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.728
By the way…

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.382
Yes?

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:25.889
I heard you’ve been a bit distracted lately.

00:18:27.984 --> 00:18:29.441
What are you talking about, King?

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:33.308
I’m talking about the girl you told Sam to keep an eye on.

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:37.211
Sam…

00:18:39.192 --> 00:18:40.458
Let me ask you straight, Queen.

00:18:42.493 --> 00:18:44.493
Do you really like that girl?

00:18:47.316 --> 00:18:48.745
Why would you think that?

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.781
Because I’ve never seen my little sister act this way with anyone before.

00:18:58.182 --> 00:19:00.182
I see her as a younger sister, that’s all.

00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:04.326
Kongtup is using that girl.

00:19:05.736 --> 00:19:07.736
I just don’t want anyone to get in trouble because of me.

00:19:08.684 --> 00:19:09.516
That’s it.

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.452
You don’t believe me, King?

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.129
It’s not that I don’t believe you.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:22.708
But I think you might be confused about something.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.271
Have you ever done something bad to someone…

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:37.056
and couldn’t forget it?

00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:42.070
You’re saying this because…?

00:19:43.018 --> 00:19:44.638
I did something wrong to her.

00:19:46.374 --> 00:19:48.428
And now she’s angry at me.

00:19:50.366 --> 00:19:51.795
So you’re asking me because…

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.356
you want to make it up to her, right?

00:19:55.354 --> 00:19:57.308
I’m just asking as a lesson.

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:59.188
Just want to know…

00:19:59.188 --> 00:20:00.273
what you’d do.

00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:03.413
Then let me give you a lesson, Queen.

00:20:04.687 --> 00:20:05.627
First…

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.869
I’d ask myself.

00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:11.639
If that person really matters enough for me to spend time making it right.

00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.599
And the second?

00:20:14.927 --> 00:20:18.149
I’d ask if I truly feel bad for what I did.

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.989
You’re asking me this…

00:20:26.584 --> 00:20:28.584
Because you feel guilty toward her, aren’t you?

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:33.062
All I can do is give you that lesson, Queen.

00:20:34.188 --> 00:20:35.780
In the end…

00:20:36.457 --> 00:20:37.642
The decision’s yours.

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:47.207
I’m just asking as a lesson.

00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:50.699
It’s not like I’m going to do anything.

00:21:02.017 --> 00:21:02.794
I’m sorry!

00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:08.828
Get in my car.

00:21:09.788 --> 00:21:10.565
I won’t.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:16.983
Or else, I’ll kiss you right here.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.308
You already see me as a bad person anyway.

00:21:23.705 --> 00:21:24.781
I’m asking you seriously.

00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:27.023
What do you want from me?

00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:30.297
Get in my car.

00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:31.708
I won’t.

00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:33.867
I’m not getting in your car.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.828
Not until you apologize to me.

00:21:36.243 --> 00:21:38.977
What makes you think you can order me around?

00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:42.413
Then what makes you stand here right now?

00:21:44.568 --> 00:21:45.128
Babe.

00:21:45.128 --> 00:21:46.001
Get in the car.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:47.017
I won’t.

00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:49.530
I’m not doing what you say.

00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:51.308
Not until you say sorry first.

00:21:51.944 --> 00:21:52.708
Get in the car.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.604
I won’t.

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:54.624
Sorry.

00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:02.378
For what?

00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:05.245
That I kissed you.

00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:07.053
When you didn’t allow me to.

00:22:08.716 --> 00:22:10.363
You knew I didn’t.

00:22:10.904 --> 00:22:11.872
Why did you kiss me then?

00:22:14.314 --> 00:22:15.662
I already said sorry.

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:19.289
Why are you still angry at me?

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:21.484
Let me go, Queen.

00:22:21.936 --> 00:22:23.039
Where are you taking me?!

00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:25.608
I told you to let go!

00:22:30.214 --> 00:22:32.214
If you don’t accept my apology.

00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:34.782
I’m not letting you go anywhere.

00:22:47.497 --> 00:22:49.171
You just said sorry a moment ago!

00:22:54.357 --> 00:22:56.085
Then accept it.

00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:00.640
Huh? Seriously?

00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:06.726
I don’t want to talk to a bossy person.

00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:10.679
Are you saying I’m bossy?

00:23:12.134 --> 00:23:13.788
Is what you’re doing not being bossy?

00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:16.403
You’re forcing me to accept your apology.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.687
I don’t even know if you’re truly sorry.

00:23:24.877 --> 00:23:26.171
I warned you.

00:23:30.678 --> 00:23:31.781
If you keep being stubborn.

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.419
I’ll kiss you right here.

00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:43.272
Queen.

00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:10.308
Alright!

00:24:12.011 --> 00:24:14.011
I’m not mad at you anymore.

00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:20.214
I’ll accept your apology.

00:24:22.215 --> 00:24:23.183
Happy now?

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:47.900
Birds…

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.536
Pretty birds…

00:24:49.356 --> 00:24:50.215
They’re about to kiss.

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:21.659
Kem.

00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:25.046
Bo.

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:27.858
I’m sorry, Bo.

00:25:30.056 --> 00:25:31.159
Please, forgive me.

00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:33.944
Please, give me another chance.

00:25:35.341 --> 00:25:36.689
I’m begging you, Bo, please.

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:39.773
Kem.

00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:41.688
Just go back, please.

00:25:50.211 --> 00:25:51.179
Why, Bo?

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.448
I promise.

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:56.015
I’ll take good care of you.

00:25:57.309 --> 00:25:58.712
You know that all this time…

00:25:59.035 --> 00:26:00.682
Everything that I did was all for you.

00:26:01.838 --> 00:26:03.132
I just don’t understand.

00:26:03.754 --> 00:26:04.868
Why are you acting like this?

00:26:08.332 --> 00:26:09.055
Bo.

00:26:10.058 --> 00:26:11.216
Do you not love me anymore?

00:26:13.848 --> 00:26:15.142
I’ve told you before, Kem.

00:26:15.682 --> 00:26:17.274
I only see you as a friend.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.060
Please don’t do this.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.086
Why, Bo?

00:26:22.186 --> 00:26:23.289
I promise, okay?

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.102
From now on, I’ll take good care of you.

00:26:27.756 --> 00:26:29.973
You know I’ve always done everything for you.

00:26:31.492 --> 00:26:32.541
I don’t understand.

00:26:33.489 --> 00:26:34.864
Why are you like this?

00:26:35.824 --> 00:26:36.438
Bo.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:38.055
Do you really not love me anymore?

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:41.786
Why are you trying to get away from me?

00:26:46.592 --> 00:26:50.113
I’ve told you, I only see you as a friend, Kem.

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:52.521
Please, don’t do this anymore.

00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:57.694
Are you scared of me, Bo?!

00:26:58.398 --> 00:26:59.420
It’s me!

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.454
What did I do to you?!

00:27:02.995 --> 00:27:04.506
Why can’t you give me another chance?

00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:07.237
Is it so wrong that I love you?

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.072
It’s that wrong, right?!

00:27:12.987 --> 00:27:13.601
Tell me!

00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:14.243
Kem!

00:27:14.243 --> 00:27:15.365
Is it that wrong?!

00:27:15.365 --> 00:27:16.700
Let me go! You’re hurting me!

00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:17.728
Please, let me go!

00:27:17.728 --> 00:27:18.228
Bo.

00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:18.759
I’m sorry.

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:19.730
I’m really sorry, Bo.

00:27:22.862 --> 00:27:23.938
How about this, Bo?

00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:26.535
Let’s go home and talk.

00:27:26.834 --> 00:27:27.532
Please.

00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:41.008
Let’s go home together.

00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:55.639
So this is the one, right, Bo?

00:27:56.261 --> 00:27:57.582
The one who’s going to steal you from me.

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.268
Why are you messing with my woman?!

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.741
What are you saying, Kem?!

00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:05.276
I’m telling the truth!

00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:07.708
Before she came along, you were good to me!

00:28:08.683 --> 00:28:10.058
But after she showed up.

00:28:11.332 --> 00:28:12.653
You started ignoring me.

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.028
Why?!

00:28:15.853 --> 00:28:16.984
Is it fun for you?!

00:28:17.877 --> 00:28:19.588
If you’re so rich, why don’t you get your own woman?!

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.088
Why are you messing with mine?!

00:28:21.309 --> 00:28:22.249
Stop it, Kem!

00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:23.078
I won’t!

00:28:23.592 --> 00:28:24.179
Why?!

00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:26.122
Can’t you accept the truth?!

00:28:26.527 --> 00:28:28.119
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:29.424
Everthing!

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.611
I took care of you and your mom.

00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:33.588
I even paid off your debt.

00:28:33.823 --> 00:28:35.348
And this is what you do to me?!

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:38.961
What am I to you?!

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:40.035
A joke?!

00:28:40.843 --> 00:28:42.272
What are you doing?! Let me go!

00:28:42.272 --> 00:28:43.317
Let me go!

00:28:44.508 --> 00:28:45.308
Let me go!

00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:50.706
I’ve never thought before.

00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:53.926
That what Seksan said about you was true.

00:28:55.537 --> 00:28:57.308
He said you were just after money.

00:28:58.078 --> 00:28:58.774
Why?!

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.200
It’s because I’m poor, right?!

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.079
So you went to her instead?!

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:01.989
Stop it, Kem!

00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:03.371
I’ve never thought before.

00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:05.188
That you’d turn out like this.

00:29:05.188 --> 00:29:07.024
I used to trust you…

00:29:07.257 --> 00:29:07.988
love you!

00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:09.773
But not anymore!

00:29:10.069 --> 00:29:12.069
I can never love you.

00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:15.668
Not even as a friend.

00:29:17.514 --> 00:29:19.064
Leave me alone, Kem.

00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:23.651
Listen to me!

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.627
If I hadn’t wasted my time taking care of you.

00:29:27.194 --> 00:29:28.828
My life would’ve been so much better!

00:29:29.207 --> 00:29:30.668
The reason I’m still poor like this…

00:29:31.014 --> 00:29:33.308
is because I have to feed you and your mom!

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:35.948
If it weren’t for you.

00:29:36.313 --> 00:29:38.612
I would’ve gotten out of this vicious cycle long ago!

00:29:41.998 --> 00:29:42.667
You…

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:45.072
are nothing but a gold-digger!

00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:47.954
Let me go!

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:49.082
Let go!

00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:53.124
Listen to me!

00:29:54.073 --> 00:29:55.668
I’m going to destroy you.

00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:58.167
Wherever you go, whoever you’re with.

00:29:58.291 --> 00:29:59.259
I’ll come for you.

00:29:59.962 --> 00:30:01.548
You’ll never find happiness again!

00:30:01.769 --> 00:30:02.411
Kem!

00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:07.268
Let me go!

00:30:11.687 --> 00:30:12.573
Beg me.

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:16.499
Beg me…

00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:19.692
and I’ll help you.

00:30:29.934 --> 00:30:31.037
What do I have to give in return?

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.018
My satisfaction.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.716
Alright.

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:55.828
Good choice…

00:30:56.308 --> 00:30:56.977
Babe.

00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:09.063
What are you going to do?

00:31:10.823 --> 00:31:12.225
Pay off your debt.

00:31:17.761 --> 00:31:19.054
Is 500,000 enough?

00:31:21.933 --> 00:31:22.901
500,000 what?!

00:31:23.197 --> 00:31:23.839
I don’t want it!

00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:39.694
Bo...

00:31:40.425 --> 00:31:40.925
Bo!

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.602
Don’t go, Bo!

00:31:42.895 --> 00:31:44.080
Come back!

00:31:45.349 --> 00:31:46.018
Let me go!

00:31:46.018 --> 00:31:47.029
I don’t want your money!

00:31:47.274 --> 00:31:48.444
I want my woman back!

00:31:48.893 --> 00:31:50.105
Come back, Bo!

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:53.759
Let me go!

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:54.965
Just remember me.

00:31:55.655 --> 00:31:56.460
One day…

00:31:56.881 --> 00:32:00.755
She’s going to play you, just like she did to me!

00:32:01.782 --> 00:32:03.592
Let me go!

00:34:56.437 --> 00:34:57.912
We’ve got nothing left, Mom.

00:34:58.215 --> 00:34:59.319
You’re selling off everything!

00:34:59.319 --> 00:34:59.823
Yes!

00:34:59.823 --> 00:35:00.931
I’ll sell off everything!

00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:01.875
And it’s none of your damn business!

00:35:05.058 --> 00:35:06.676
Please, don’t gamble anymore.

00:35:06.812 --> 00:35:08.860
I don’t know how I can keep finding money for you anymore.

00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:09.756
Bo!

00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:11.027
I’m your mother.

00:35:11.473 --> 00:35:13.569
Your job is to bring me money!

00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:15.403
You’ve got no right to talk to me like this!

00:35:15.403 --> 00:35:18.213
Bua!

00:35:18.213 --> 00:35:19.494
Please…

00:35:20.844 --> 00:35:22.963
I had some savings set aside for my parents.

00:35:23.648 --> 00:35:25.409
And you don’t have to pay me back.

00:35:25.998 --> 00:35:26.877
I’m glad to help.

00:35:28.706 --> 00:35:30.062
Mom took my tuition money.

00:35:30.388 --> 00:35:31.836
And she also sold my bike.

00:35:32.252 --> 00:35:33.727
How much is your tuition?

00:35:34.173 --> 00:35:35.116
Let me help you pay for it.

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:36.471
I really appreciate it.

00:35:37.108 --> 00:35:38.130
It’s really just you…

00:35:38.357 --> 00:35:39.164
who’s always there for me.

00:35:45.773 --> 00:35:47.248
Is it so wrong that I love you?

00:35:48.076 --> 00:35:49.002
It’s that wrong, right?!

00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:55.415
Do you even know what I’ve done for you?!

00:35:56.004 --> 00:35:56.835
Everthing!

00:35:57.325 --> 00:35:59.015
I took care of you and your mom.

00:35:59.604 --> 00:36:01.031
I even paid off your debt.

00:36:04.691 --> 00:36:05.856
Listen to me!

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:08.898
If I hadn’t wasted my time taking care of you.

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:11.130
My life would’ve been so much better!

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.311
You…

00:36:13.357 --> 00:36:14.808
are nothing but a gold-digger!

00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:19.668
Beg me.

00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:23.688
Beg me…

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.515
and I’ll help you.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.663
Why did you help me?

00:37:00.147 --> 00:37:01.240
Because you begged me.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.240
Are you not going to ask me?

00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:22.686
About who that guy was?

00:37:26.162 --> 00:37:27.566
That’s your personal matter.

00:37:45.554 --> 00:37:46.313
Also…

00:37:57.389 --> 00:37:58.356
When you’re with me…

00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:01.287
Never look down for anyone.

00:38:04.786 --> 00:38:06.022
Do you understand?

00:38:18.802 --> 00:38:20.540
What about our deal?

00:38:22.727 --> 00:38:24.536
What do I have to do to satisfy you?

00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:32.705
We’ll talk about that later.

00:38:53.232 --> 00:38:54.182
What are you doing, Babe?!

00:38:56.179 --> 00:38:57.988
Is this what you want?

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.652
The thing that satisfies you.

00:39:07.434 --> 00:39:09.768
I’ll do what you said to make you satisfied.

00:39:11.311 --> 00:39:11.975
Get down!

00:40:33.509 --> 00:40:34.316
Get up.

00:40:40.821 --> 00:40:41.557
Come here.

00:40:58.828 --> 00:41:00.828
Stop whatever you’re thinking right now.

00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:04.896
I don’t always see through you, Babe.

00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:12.555
But what you just did…

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:14.142
wasn’t cute.

00:41:22.233 --> 00:41:23.159
Go take a shower.

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:24.794
We’ll talk after.

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:51.956
(What do I have to give in return?)

00:41:52.222 --> 00:41:53.530
(My satisfaction.)

00:43:56.062 --> 00:43:57.776
I don’t usually sit like this.

00:43:59.557 --> 00:44:00.937
It’s not comfortable.

00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:10.735
I’m putting my earphones on.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:16.258
You can sing as loud as you want, or do whatever you like.

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:18.250
I won’t hear anything.

00:46:21.143 --> 00:46:22.198
Listen to this song.

00:47:07.206 --> 00:47:08.645
About our deal…

00:47:09.436 --> 00:47:10.432
What do I have to do?

00:47:14.441 --> 00:47:16.441
You’ll have to take care of me personally.

00:47:17.793 --> 00:47:18.494
In everything.

00:47:21.233 --> 00:47:23.233
I don’t think I’m capable enough to do that.

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:27.083
I’m not looking for someone capable.

00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.847
It’d hurt less if you just criticized me directly.

00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:38.104
You’ll be taking care of me after working hours.

00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:41.976
Which means after your classes end.

00:47:43.805 --> 00:47:45.421
But I have to go work at the club.

00:47:46.507 --> 00:47:48.567
I don’t give this kind of opportunity to anyone.

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:49.741
How much do they pay you there?

00:47:51.692 --> 00:47:52.865
I’ll pay you double.

00:47:59.065 --> 00:48:01.331
It sounds like you think I’m only after money.

00:48:06.673 --> 00:48:07.728
When you work…

00:48:08.725 --> 00:48:09.691
you get paid.

00:48:14.105 --> 00:48:15.426
Staying here with me…

00:48:17.073 --> 00:48:19.280
I can guarantee your safety.

00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.227
And your job…

00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:28.051
is to satisfy me.

00:48:58.183 --> 00:48:59.651
May I ask you something?

00:49:03.218 --> 00:49:05.631
Why are you letting me get this close to you?

00:49:06.038 --> 00:49:07.093
Do you trust me?

00:49:10.689 --> 00:49:12.423
That’s the question you should ask yourself.

00:49:15.901 --> 00:49:17.488
How much I can really trust you.

00:49:30.044 --> 00:49:32.044
I will do whatever it takes to make you trust me.

00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:37.049
I’ll see about that...

00:49:38.105 --> 00:49:38.835
Babe.

00:50:22.411 --> 00:50:23.939
Are you going to sleep standing there?

00:50:28.391 --> 00:50:29.328
I can…

00:50:30.148 --> 00:50:32.104
sleep right here.

00:50:41.167 --> 00:50:42.222
Come sleep on the bed.

00:50:48.269 --> 00:50:49.265
Bed it is.

00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:38.618
Do you want to fall off?

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:46.340
Queen?!

00:51:55.372 --> 00:51:56.250
Just sleep properly.

00:52:09.214 --> 00:52:11.214
There’s something I want to warn you about.

00:52:18.744 --> 00:52:20.104
Don’t ever do that again.

00:52:27.267 --> 00:52:29.001
I only trust you 10%.

00:52:32.893 --> 00:52:34.421
Please don’t make it zero.

00:54:15.268 --> 00:54:16.471
I woke up late.

00:54:16.907 --> 00:54:18.257
Why didn’t you wake me up?

00:54:31.916 --> 00:54:33.001
Put your shirt on properly.

00:54:36.301 --> 00:54:37.445
You didn’t see anything, right?

00:54:39.771 --> 00:54:40.856
If I didn’t see anything…

00:54:41.558 --> 00:54:42.554
would I have said something?

00:54:49.896 --> 00:54:51.896
You might be in the news with me after this.

00:54:54.399 --> 00:54:56.104
Am I getting you in trouble?

00:54:58.223 --> 00:54:59.544
I just want to tell you.

00:55:00.482 --> 00:55:02.482
If someone asks you about this.

00:55:03.716 --> 00:55:05.923
Just tell them you’re Queen’s.

00:55:07.688 --> 00:55:08.861
That way, you’ll be safe.

00:55:11.431 --> 00:55:12.486
If I say that…

00:55:13.424 --> 00:55:15.542
Won’t you get in even more trouble?

00:55:17.337 --> 00:55:18.422
Why would I be in trouble?

00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:22.987
Because I’m just some girl.

00:55:24.398 --> 00:55:25.483
Who ran away from home.

00:55:25.978 --> 00:55:27.122
Working in a club.

00:55:27.883 --> 00:55:28.849
But you…

00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:30.755
You’re from...

00:55:31.693 --> 00:55:32.807
a wealthy family.

00:55:33.332 --> 00:55:34.682
And hold a high position.

00:55:35.798 --> 00:55:38.104
I don’t want anyone to use me to attack you.

00:55:39.748 --> 00:55:41.039
Don’t think for me.

00:55:41.978 --> 00:55:43.240
I’m just telling the truth.

00:55:44.105 --> 00:55:45.514
What’s so bad about being mine?

00:55:47.976 --> 00:55:50.104
You know how different we are.

00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:51.910
I don’t want to aim too high.

00:55:52.819 --> 00:55:53.845
When you fall…

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.897
It hurts.

00:55:59.534 --> 00:56:00.855
If you don’t want to get hurt…

00:56:03.033 --> 00:56:04.708
Then hold on to it tightly.

00:56:17.184 --> 00:56:18.357
Perfect timing.

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.174
Good morning.

00:56:24.567 --> 00:56:25.829
Good morning.

00:56:51.802 --> 00:56:53.802
Is there something you needed, King?

00:56:56.305 --> 00:56:59.250
Sam told me my little sister’s got a girl staying here.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.657
So, I just wanted to see for myself.

00:57:15.419 --> 00:57:17.567
You’ve seen her now, so why don’t you head back?

00:57:20.225 --> 00:57:21.487
I just got here.

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:22.949
Why are you rushing me out already?

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.165
I didn’t think…

00:57:29.453 --> 00:57:30.951
Babe would be this cute.

00:57:38.524 --> 00:57:39.815
Her name is Bo.

00:57:44.105 --> 00:57:45.131
Bonita.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:14.982
Bo.

00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:17.034
Fern told me…

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.702
You quit?

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.249
Mmm.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.246
I got a new job.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:23.428
A new job?!

00:58:23.746 --> 00:58:24.653
What kind of job?

00:58:25.592 --> 00:58:26.558
Not telling.

00:58:27.526 --> 00:58:29.555
So, you’re keeping secrets from me now?

00:58:32.797 --> 00:58:34.531
Isn’t that Queen’s car?

00:58:44.496 --> 00:58:45.610
What is she doing here?

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.143
Bo!

00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:54.111
Keep your phone ready.

00:58:54.111 --> 00:58:55.591
You’re telling me everything.

00:59:08.436 --> 00:59:09.491
Hello?

00:59:15.066 --> 00:59:15.737
Huh?!

00:59:17.296 --> 00:59:18.203
What’s going on?

00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:19.644
Hold on, Ging.

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:22.578
Bo!

00:59:22.578 --> 00:59:25.752
Ging’s mom isn’t doing well and got moved to the ICU this morning.

00:59:25.752 --> 00:59:27.815
Can you cover my shift today?

00:59:27.815 --> 00:59:31.701
I want to stay with Ging, but I don’t want to call in last minute.

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.923
Please.

00:59:36.279 --> 00:59:37.186
Sure.

00:59:37.186 --> 00:59:38.302
I’ll go in for you today.

00:59:38.302 --> 00:59:39.391
You should stay with Ging.

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:41.192
Thank you so much, Bo.

00:59:41.192 --> 00:59:42.911
We’ve got a lot of reservations today too.

00:59:54.578 --> 00:59:55.633
Good afternoon, Sam.

00:59:55.633 --> 00:59:56.519
Good afternoon, Babe.

00:59:56.837 --> 00:59:57.508
Please.

01:00:02.303 --> 01:00:03.210
Good afternoon.

01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:11.863
Watch your head.

01:00:12.447 --> 01:00:13.384
Thank you.

01:00:28.689 --> 01:00:30.335
Is there something you want to tell me?

01:00:35.982 --> 01:00:36.830
I…

01:00:37.739 --> 01:00:40.034
I have to work at the club today.

01:00:49.624 --> 01:00:50.797
But I have a reason.

01:00:58.056 --> 01:00:58.993
What reason?

01:01:02.105 --> 01:01:03.426
If it’s not good enough…

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.803
I’m not letting you go.

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:14.367
I’m going to cover Mint’s shift tonight.

01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:22.975
Mint who works with me at the club.

01:01:24.356 --> 01:01:25.263
She’s called Bunny.

01:01:31.778 --> 01:01:35.520
Mint’s girlfriend’s mom got into the ICU, so Mint’s going to be with her.

01:01:39.914 --> 01:01:41.176
May I go?

01:01:49.085 --> 01:01:50.104
That’s up to you.

01:01:56.105 --> 01:01:57.455
But I’m going with you.

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.615
Why?

01:02:08.764 --> 01:02:10.233
Can’t I just chill there?

01:02:13.545 --> 01:02:15.043
Sure.

01:02:16.538 --> 01:02:17.918
Why can’t you...?

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:26.530
I’ll drop you off at the club first.

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:29.707
After I finish work…

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:31.819
I’ll come join you.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.490
Okay.

01:02:38.249 --> 01:02:39.068
Thank you.

01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:49.139
Yes.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.453
This way, Queen.

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:11.567
Bie has already let me know you’d be coming.

01:03:11.567 --> 01:03:13.461
Please, have a seat at your table.

01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:18.453
Where’s the girl who told you?

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:24.204
Bie’s already been booked for the night.

01:03:25.437 --> 01:03:26.787
I sincerely apologize.

01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:49.279
Would you like me to send someone else to serve you?

01:03:49.957 --> 01:03:50.806
No.

01:03:52.039 --> 01:03:53.360
I’ll handle it myself.

01:03:54.276 --> 01:03:55.036
Yes.

01:04:30.966 --> 01:04:33.202
Queen just left for work.

01:04:33.461 --> 01:04:34.398
I’m not here for Queen.

01:04:34.546 --> 01:04:35.515
I’m here for you.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.104
If I wanted to buy your secrets from this girl.

01:04:38.104 --> 01:04:40.497
I could pay you much more than Queen.

01:04:40.497 --> 01:04:41.638
Ask her then.

01:04:41.786 --> 01:04:43.153
I’d like to know that too.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.937
What do you want from me?

01:04:45.242 --> 01:04:47.655
Once you’ve crossed the finish line.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:49.420
The victory is yours.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.523
But if you refuse to accept it.

01:04:51.523 --> 01:04:53.747
Then you’ve given it up to someone else.
