TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.403
FV IMAGIN

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:49.904
Push it to the edge!

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:51.531
Be careful.

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.160
Hi, is the captain here?

00:00:57.704 --> 00:00:59.581
Captain! Sir!

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.167
What do you want?

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:03.793
Hello.

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:06.588
My name is Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:11.384
We wanted to ask you for a favor, sir.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.471
Do you load different items on your ship,
such as shoes?

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.308
We have 5,000 safety shoes
that have to go.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.228
Can you ship them to Mexico?

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:27.650
Did he just say yes?

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:29.611
-I think so.
-Right?

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:31.029
Boys.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:33.281
-What did he say?
-What?

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:37.201
-Did you bring the proof of receipt?
-I don't have it.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.455
-What? Why?
-Oh, my gosh.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.335
You punks!
Can't you see I'm busy right now?

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:47.670
What are you waiting for? Throw more salt!

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:51.466
You guys are just unbelievable!

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:52.967
Watch out.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:54.802
-Oh, my gosh.
-What did I do wrong?

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:56.930
Give that to me. Jeez.

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:59.349
Okay, we'll come back another time.

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:01.226
Don't ever come back, you punks!

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.395
-Get lost!
-We have to get the shoes on that ship.

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:08.066
You'll have to change your name
if you want to do that.

00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.656
You bastard!

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.076
-Hey, punk.
-Where's our money?

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.204
Please give me two more days.
I swear I'll pay you back.

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.039
Please, I beg you.

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:27.585
-You bastard!
-Please show mercy!

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.421
Please spare me!

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:32.799
Please have mercy…

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.430
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM

00:02:56.906 --> 00:02:58.157
Hey, Hyun-jun.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:00.034
Do you know that thing I asked for?

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:02.120
-Your new position?
-Yes.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.666
-Good job.
-Have a good day.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.172
My job offer got canceled, and…

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.009
What good are friends for anyway?

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:20.179
-I'll put in a word with HR. Go see them.
-Really?

00:03:20.263 --> 00:03:22.473
Are you sure I can really do that?

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:24.267
Seriously, thank you.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:25.810
Mr. Pyo.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.147
This is the CEO of Uriel.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.316
He had a loan of five million
plus interest, which makes it 20 million.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.234
Give it to him.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.780
Can we please take our goods back?

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:40.116
We really need to get them delivered.

00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:54.756
What are you…

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:56.549
I didn't get paid.

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.430
-Hey!
-Grab him!

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.099
What are you doing? Stop!

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.312
Do you know what you're doing?

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.110
Stop it!

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:22.283
-Get him out of here.
-You bastard!

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:25.495
-How many?
-Eleven stacks.

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:31.959
-A deep-sea fishing boat?
-Yes.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:32.877
No.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.421
-Why not?
-Isn't it obvious?

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:39.133
Who uses a fishing boat to load cargo?

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.221
Where were you all night?
What gave you such a crazy idea?

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:47.141
How much is this Danish money worth?

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:48.810
The krone was 253 won.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:52.313
Is there no way to load it?

00:04:52.397 --> 00:04:55.316
Forget all this nonsense
and stick with me, Ms. Oh.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.026
I'll pay you three times more.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.319
Absolutely not.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.654
No.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:03.658
There's nothing in the contract
about how we should make the delivery.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:07.286
-They just need to verify the goods.
-That's right.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.580
What's wrong with both of you?

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.041
That's smuggling!

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:22.593
-What's the name of the ship?
-The name was…

00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:24.512
It was…

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.431
It was called FV Imagin.

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:28.099
-FV Imagin.
-What?

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:29.100
FV Imagin.

00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:31.936
Oh, my gosh.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.021
My head hurts.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.738
Hello? It's me.

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:45.408
I'm going to send two of my staff--

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.451
You want me to come too?

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:51.038
Sure.

00:05:59.547 --> 00:06:04.427
PUSAN SIMYEONG SHIPPING

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.723
It's a herbal tea drink.

00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:10.892
Do you have Dr Pepper?

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.395
Maybe not in Pusan.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.397
They don't have any.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.900
I'll make my own drink, the American way.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.699
We're prepared to offer
compensation for your services.

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:28.993
What? "Compensation"?

00:06:30.453 --> 00:06:34.123
How dare a woman speak up?

00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:39.212
I'm about to lose my mind
because my engineer just ran off!

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:43.132
You think I'm going to budge
for chump change?

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:46.344
This is why I don't deal with boat guys.

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:47.303
"Boat guys"?

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:51.098
How dare you spout
that ignorant, sexist nonsense?

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:52.516
You're a disgrace!

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:54.769
Kang Tae-poong.

00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:56.437
-Yes?
-Kaiser was not like this.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.522
He was a great man.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:03.945
Kaiser? Who's that? What a funny name.

00:07:04.028 --> 00:07:06.197
Don't you know your father's name?

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:07.823
He was Kaiser Kang.

00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:12.495
This kid is Kaiser's son?

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:14.121
He looks just like him.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.457
Stand up, kid.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:18.626
I said, stand up.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.128
Attention!

00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:23.005
At ease.

00:07:23.506 --> 00:07:25.007
Attention! At ease.

00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.133
Attention!

00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:28.970
At ease, attention, at ease, attention!

00:07:29.053 --> 00:07:32.139
At ease.

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:35.768
He's no good.

00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:38.771
Is it true?

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:40.982
Why are you making me do this?

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:47.905
Your father and I shared meals,
boarded the same ship,

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:49.365
and even caught some tuna together--

00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:51.492
Sure, you went to the sauna.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:52.868
We get it.

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:54.996
So, what can you do for him?

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:58.499
But even if my ship goes
all the way to Mexico,

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.377
what are you going to do there?

00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:04.255
You guys don't realize it,

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.465
but even with a local broker,

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:10.011
something is bound to go wrong
if they send the goods from there.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.180
-Are you aware of that?
-What if I went on the ship?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.268
What about Bo-ram?

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:19.228
She'll be okay.

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:24.900
It would be helpful to you
if I were to board that ship.

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:27.778
Do you have a marine engineer license?

00:08:27.862 --> 00:08:29.989
I graduated
from Yeongdo Maritime University.

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:33.743
I've never worked on fishing boats,
only two tours on oil tankers,

00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:36.495
but I got off because I didn't want
to do nine months.

00:08:37.913 --> 00:08:39.749
Looks like I'll be on it for two years.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.752
Aside from that, there's one more problem.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:45.546
How are we going
to get 5,000 safety shoes…

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:49.383
onto a ship?

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:55.973
I will…

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:04.732
figure out a way to make that happen.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:10.655
Auntie.

00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:13.574
-Do you still have sea eel?
-At this hour?

00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:18.371
Isn't two years too long?

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.751
This is all my fault.
It's the least I could do.

00:09:24.627 --> 00:09:25.836
What about your daughter?

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:28.714
I'll send her to her mom's.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:33.094
She's young,
but I'm sure she'll understand.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:45.564
Mr. Park.

00:09:46.941 --> 00:09:49.902
Just stick it out for the long haul.

00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.364
You'll end up
with many more opportunities in life.

00:09:53.948 --> 00:09:55.157
That's exactly my plan.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:59.370
That way, I'll be able
to repay all this kindness.

00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:01.622
My point exactly.

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.379
But what exactly is Kang Tae-poong

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:10.923
planning to do?

00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:14.301
Can he actually load those safety shoes?

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:16.303
There are so many of them.

00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:19.140
That's what I'm worried about too.

00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:26.605
CRAB AND OTHER SEAFOOD

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:43.289
We have crabs and other seafood!

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:44.874
He's here!

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:48.627
Let's get to work.

00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:57.428
Be careful.

00:11:00.264 --> 00:11:02.099
It's heavy. Careful.

00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:04.560
Here, be careful.

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:19.492
You're coming to our ship.

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:06.497
That's all of it.

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.582
Take a look.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.464
CRAB AND OTHER SEAFOOD

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:17.758
Come on, get up here!

00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:20.594
-I'm coming up, Captain!
-Hurry up.

00:12:26.976 --> 00:12:29.853
You should keep living life your own way.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:31.480
Sorry?

00:12:31.564 --> 00:12:38.112
Even if you've got no money nor dignity,
all you need is someone by your side.

00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:43.450
No matter how much the world changes,

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:46.954
in the end, it's still people
who will live in that world.

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:48.706
We're all the same after all.

00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:51.125
-You can bring that here.
-Okay.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:52.668
Thank you.

00:12:56.088 --> 00:12:57.840
Here, you dummy.

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:02.386
Thank you.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:03.804
Are the shoes okay?

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:07.558
"Shoes that are strong even in sub-zero
temperatures, Shoe Park's Safety Shoes."

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.643
-Is that so?
-Yes, look.

00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:11.979
The sun's rising! Let's get a move on!

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:15.816
-My own way?
-Your own way.

00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:17.985
My own way!

00:13:34.627 --> 00:13:36.170
Are you really sure about this?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:42.760
There are people who bet their own life
for a complete stranger.

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:48.349
-But what about Bo-ram?
-I've taken care of it.

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:51.769
Shoe Park is like my child too.

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:54.229
I should take responsibility.

00:13:55.522 --> 00:13:56.690
Don't worry about me.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:04.031
Mr. Kang.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.620
I am truly sorry
for everything up till now,

00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:12.665
and I am truly grateful.

00:14:13.832 --> 00:14:16.585
When we meet again in two years,

00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:20.089
I promise to be someone
you can look up to.

00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:21.173
Come on.

00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:23.842
Stop being so sappy.

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:28.055
-But you were really cool today.
-You think so?

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.769
I never did that. You were the one
who emphasized that we had five patents.

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:35.896
Shoe Park's…

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.773
-Safety Shoes.
-Safety Shoes.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:39.733
That was cool.

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:44.446
What's that sound?

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.572
A siren?

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:49.410
It's the cops. We need to hide.

00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:51.203
-Over there.
-Wait…

00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:58.210
Attention, FV Imagin.

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.004
Please hold your departure.

00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:03.090
You are forbidden from setting sail.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.176
Get off the ship, Tae-poong!

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.886
-Me?
-Get off!

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.763
I have to get out of here.

00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:11.807
Please stop what you're doing.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.851
Please hold your departure.

00:15:13.934 --> 00:15:16.645
You are forbidden from setting sail.

00:15:22.067 --> 00:15:22.943
Go through there.

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:34.329
What's going on?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.544
-Where is he?
-What do we do?

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:46.008
Hello, sir. Is something wrong?

00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:49.887
We got a report that suspicious items
may have been loaded onto your ship.

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:52.806
All this over a report?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.433
We have to depart right now.

00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:58.395
Please show me the crew members' IDs
and the departure declaration form.

00:15:59.021 --> 00:16:00.189
Gather round, everyone!

00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:04.318
Get your IDs and passports out!

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:09.364
-Come on, hurry up.
-Seriously?

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:16.580
Cover me.

00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:20.000
Come on!

00:16:24.546 --> 00:16:25.422
Let's see.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.926
-Please take your hat off.
-Jeez.

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:31.303
Someone reported you for smuggling drugs.

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:35.182
That's ridiculous!
It's hardly worth the risk.

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:36.975
Park Yun-cheol.

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:42.106
But, Officer,

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:45.734
who's going to take responsibility
if we can't sail because of this?

00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:49.488
Goodness, should I call
our company or what?

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:53.158
We're just checking.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.452
What are you waiting for? Move!

00:16:59.123 --> 00:16:59.957
That's me.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:02.626
You're good.

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:34.241
Thank you for your hard work.

00:17:36.577 --> 00:17:37.411
Mr. Kang.

00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:38.954
What's going on?

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:43.375
They can't go that way.
What if they stop us from departing?

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:45.794
I'll figure something out, so stop them.

00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:47.838
-Stop them?
-Go.

00:17:49.631 --> 00:17:51.466
Thanks for all your hard work!

00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:54.761
Would you like a cup of coffee
before you go?

00:17:54.845 --> 00:17:56.638
I'll make a nice cup for everyone.

00:17:56.722 --> 00:17:59.892
The captain said you guys
are working so hard

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:01.602
and insisted you stay for coffee.

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:50.234
-I'll make--
-There's nothing there.

00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:52.194
-I'll check over there.
-Hurry up.

00:18:52.903 --> 00:18:54.446
Stop!

00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:56.114
What are you doing?

00:18:59.368 --> 00:19:00.535
Hey!

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.163
Hey!

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.540
It's been a while since I've done this!

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:08.168
I'm getting high!

00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:10.087
Stop right there!

00:19:13.131 --> 00:19:14.466
What is that?

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.010
-What?
-Over there!

00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:18.720
What?

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:22.474
What is that?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.352
Look over there.

00:19:27.354 --> 00:19:28.689
Is that Mr. Kang?

00:19:28.772 --> 00:19:29.898
Hey!

00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:33.568
I wanted a deep-sea fishing boat,

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:37.990
but a tanker is fine too!

00:19:43.203 --> 00:19:44.955
I'm going all out tonight!

00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:48.250
-I'm getting high!
-That little…

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:52.004
Calling Seagull Three!

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:53.630
Drug suspect sighted!

00:19:53.714 --> 00:19:55.299
Requesting backup!

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:05.058
What's he doing?

00:20:06.852 --> 00:20:08.145
I'm so high!

00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.525
Is he doing drugs?

00:20:13.608 --> 00:20:16.236
No, he's eating it.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.530
No wonder he had a weird look in his eyes.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:20.282
He's an absolute lunatic.

00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:30.667
Is that flour?

00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:32.627
What the…

00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:35.130
Did he starve or something?

00:20:35.213 --> 00:20:36.423
Why is he eating that?

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:38.759
That's how people do drugs.

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:39.968
FLOUR

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:44.389
This is amazing!

00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:46.141
It's amazing!

00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:49.519
Oh, my gosh.

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:57.527
Calling Seagull Three!

00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.780
The incident has been resolved.
Cancel backup.

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.158
Captain.

00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:06.119
I'm sorry for keeping you.

00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:09.498
We have plenty of time,
so we'll get ready to set sail now.

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:11.583
Come on, crew!

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:15.212
-Let's go back to the sea!
-Yes, sir.

00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:24.971
I'm so high!

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.781
Shoe Park's Safety Shoes.

00:22:22.696 --> 00:22:23.613
Gosh.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.833
-Who are you?
-Hello.

00:22:35.417 --> 00:22:37.502
-I must've scared you. I--
-Come here.

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:38.879
-Okay, I--
-Come here.

00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:40.589
-Come here.
-Wait.

00:22:40.672 --> 00:22:41.923
Please listen to me.

00:22:42.007 --> 00:22:43.842
-Captain!
-Wait, please.

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:45.677
-Hold on.
-Captain.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.053
-Just a minute.
-What is it?

00:22:47.137 --> 00:22:49.264
Hello, Captain. I'm Kang Tae-poong.

00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:51.433
I must've scared you.

00:22:51.516 --> 00:22:53.476
I got on here by accident.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.687
You're a suspicious guy.

00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:57.147
I'm not.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:23:01.151
This white powder isn't drugs. It's flour.

00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:02.944
I'm not a suspicious guy.

00:23:03.028 --> 00:23:04.279
Shut your mouth!

00:23:04.362 --> 00:23:07.449
-Please let me get off--
-I told you to shut up.

00:23:08.325 --> 00:23:09.409
Nice!

00:23:09.492 --> 00:23:10.702
Let's see.

00:23:11.244 --> 00:23:13.205
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:23:37.562 --> 00:23:39.439
Who the heck are those guys?

00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:52.619
There you are.

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:01.294
What do you want?

00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:04.673
I'm Ryu Hui-gyu.

00:24:07.175 --> 00:24:08.176
Hey, mister.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.636
That one's mine,

00:24:10.762 --> 00:24:11.721
so let him go.

00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:24.359
Did you load all the shoes?

00:24:24.442 --> 00:24:25.443
Jeez.

00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:32.951
Did you come because you were worried?

00:24:34.244 --> 00:24:35.161
With that kid?

00:24:35.245 --> 00:24:38.248
That bastard is such a pain.

00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:45.338
Give me a hand.

00:24:49.843 --> 00:24:50.760
Tae-poong.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.139
I came for your eyes.

00:25:02.522 --> 00:25:04.107
I asked if you loaded them.

00:25:04.733 --> 00:25:08.028
-How did you find me?
-I know everything that happens in Pusan.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.489
Then why are you asking?

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.953
-You bastard.
-Hold on.

00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.288
I want to do it.

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:28.798
Don't you want to go back?

00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:31.426
Do you hate me too?

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:32.927
I hate you, you bastard.

00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:34.596
Beg for your life.

00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:37.140
Is that what you want?

00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:42.354
"Please spare me."

00:25:43.396 --> 00:25:44.898
Please kill me

00:25:46.232 --> 00:25:47.734
if you don't want your money.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.070
The sea is still cold.

00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:53.323
Can you even last one minute?

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:00.705
Do it.

00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:03.458
But if you can't kill me now,

00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:07.379
you'll never be able to kill me.

00:26:25.563 --> 00:26:26.564
Is that so?

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:30.151
I won't get the money if I kill you now.

00:26:36.574 --> 00:26:39.035
Hold on. That's it?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.954
Hey!

00:26:41.454 --> 00:26:43.748
Do you think I came here just for that?!

00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:47.419
If I give you that money,
will you kill him?

00:26:48.962 --> 00:26:49.838
How much?

00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:52.674
How much will it take?

00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.137
Are you that rich?

00:26:58.972 --> 00:26:59.848
Then…

00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:03.935
How much will your father pay for this?

00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:09.190
What are you saying, you thug?

00:27:09.274 --> 00:27:10.608
Have you lost your mind?

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.862
My dad won't pay you.

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:17.532
If you send him my ear,

00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:21.161
he'll kill all of you.

00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:29.961
See you.

00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:35.425
Get out of my way, please.

00:27:39.888 --> 00:27:41.306
That's salt water!

00:27:42.182 --> 00:27:43.892
Jeez, salt water!

00:27:43.975 --> 00:27:46.269
It's fake anyway, so who cares?

00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:49.939
Come on, you should get the authentic one.

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:53.193
Damn it.

00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:57.363
Bring this to the dry cleaner's,
Manager Ha!

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:04.871
Where is he? I don't see him.
I'm so worried.

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:06.831
Where did he go?

00:28:07.707 --> 00:28:12.337
What if he fell off that boat earlier?

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.379
What?

00:28:14.672 --> 00:28:16.090
This is weird.

00:28:17.884 --> 00:28:19.594
Hey!

00:28:19.677 --> 00:28:22.972
-What are you doing? Are you crazy?
-I should go look for him!

00:28:23.056 --> 00:28:25.350
No, you're going to die out there!

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:26.434
I'm a good swimmer.

00:28:26.518 --> 00:28:27.560
-No!
-He can't swim.

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:29.229
What if he drowns?

00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:31.064
-Let's just wait!
-I can't!

00:28:31.147 --> 00:28:33.274
Who else is going to save him?

00:28:33.358 --> 00:28:36.194
Hey!

00:28:37.737 --> 00:28:38.696
Over here!

00:28:39.197 --> 00:28:40.198
I'm here!

00:28:40.823 --> 00:28:41.783
Over here!

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:44.077
I'm right here!

00:28:50.792 --> 00:28:55.296
Hey!

00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:58.299
-I made it back in one piece!
-Mr. Kang!

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.595
Why do you make me worried sick?

00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:06.349
-I was so scared.
-Well…

00:29:13.398 --> 00:29:14.524
Get a room, you two.

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:20.280
Ms. Oh.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.199
I'm sorry.

00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:25.743
You always manage to surprise me.

00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:26.995
I was just so worried.

00:29:27.078 --> 00:29:28.913
-I'm sorry.
-You're more reckless.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:33.293
Are you okay?

00:29:34.294 --> 00:29:38.047
-Are you returning to Seoul?
-I should go check on Bo-ram.

00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:41.676
Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

00:29:43.177 --> 00:29:47.015
Didn't you tell me to mind my own business
because the world is cold?

00:29:47.098 --> 00:29:50.935
Even if the world is cold,
you should still be kind.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.187
I'm off.

00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:55.982
You'd better call me
when you have raw fish next time.

00:29:56.065 --> 00:29:56.983
We will.

00:29:57.066 --> 00:29:59.027
-Take care.
-Thank you.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.653
-Thank you.
-Thank you for everything.

00:30:09.203 --> 00:30:10.872
-Put your shoes on.
-Yes.

00:30:10.955 --> 00:30:12.665
-You're not hurt, are you?
-No.

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:15.043
-Here are your shoes.
-I'll put them on.

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:33.269
The goods should arrive safely, right?

00:30:33.853 --> 00:30:35.480
They just have to cross the border.

00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.317
What happened to your hand?

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.194
Did you get hurt?

00:30:41.277 --> 00:30:43.863
It's from when I was trying
to get the tube earlier.

00:30:45.031 --> 00:30:47.784
-Why would you--
-I'm fine.

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:49.661
It's not that bad.

00:30:57.877 --> 00:30:58.836
Ms. Oh.

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:06.135
I think I like you.

00:31:06.678 --> 00:31:07.887
Pardon?

00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:11.391
You look dirty and scruffy now.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.019
But you're beautiful.

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:25.446
You're not so clean yourself right now.

00:31:26.781 --> 00:31:28.199
Now that I think about it,

00:31:29.117 --> 00:31:30.451
you always look the same,

00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:34.038
but you're becoming lovelier.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.710
You're cute when you're mad,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.503
and when you smile…

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:44.173
you're beautiful.

00:31:47.343 --> 00:31:49.137
What are you talking about?

00:31:49.971 --> 00:31:52.181
-This is so sudden.
-That's it.

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.977
I like you, Ms. Oh.

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.523
That's why you're pretty.

00:32:03.693 --> 00:32:05.820
What are you saying right now?

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:10.575
You should go take a nap.
I think you're sleep-deprived.

00:32:18.332 --> 00:32:19.417
Maybe you're right.

00:32:20.084 --> 00:32:21.836
Go take a nap.

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:34.182
This is so heavy.

00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:12.220
What made those days more painful was

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:15.264
that the most basic things

00:33:15.973 --> 00:33:17.350
were stripped away.

00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:23.731
There was no way

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:26.984
to know who was to blame for it all.

00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:29.779
No.

00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:33.825
No one could even think
about such things back then.

00:33:33.908 --> 00:33:35.451
Why isn't the car coming?

00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:37.411
-It's freezing.
-Excuse me.

00:33:38.162 --> 00:33:39.080
Passing through.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.415
-Watch it.
-Sorry about that.

00:33:44.252 --> 00:33:45.086
Is that it?

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.381
There it is.

00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:56.973
This is the last car for today. Get in!

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.103
Hey, you!

00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:08.401
Don't push!

00:34:55.114 --> 00:34:58.618
1,000 PAST EXAM QUESTIONS

00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:02.121
We had to get through
impossibly difficult days…

00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:04.957
-Honey!
-We're almost there.

00:35:06.042 --> 00:35:07.335
We're nearly there.

00:35:11.422 --> 00:35:13.257
INFANT VISITATION HOURS

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:24.644
…and find a way to keep our families safe.

00:35:27.855 --> 00:35:33.027
The only thing we needed
was some kind of sign,

00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:35.279
however small,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.698
that tomorrow would come,

00:35:38.824 --> 00:35:40.243
and that we weren't alone.

00:35:42.828 --> 00:35:45.748
You can use this here.

00:35:48.626 --> 00:35:49.543
Oh, dear.

00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:52.255
-You're done already?
-Yes.

00:35:52.338 --> 00:35:56.592
Look at you. You now seem like
a true seamstress.

00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:00.429
What are you working on?

00:36:01.013 --> 00:36:03.015
I'm fixing my youngest son's gym uniform.

00:36:03.933 --> 00:36:05.393
Your son would love that.

00:36:10.856 --> 00:36:14.527
EPISODE 7
THE MEANING OF LIFE

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.530
-I win.
-No, I win!

00:36:19.323 --> 00:36:22.159
Hi! Jjuggu!

00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:26.455
-Jjuggu!
-It's Jjuggu!

00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:29.041
-Jjuggu!
-Be careful with your hands.

00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:34.380
There we go.

00:36:35.172 --> 00:36:36.257
Look up.

00:36:43.347 --> 00:36:46.392
You're supposed to say hello
when you see someone.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.188
This tiny house is way too crowded.
Isn't that right?

00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:59.280
How come no matter how much I wash myself,
I don't smell as good as Ji-hun?

00:36:59.864 --> 00:37:00.990
What?

00:37:02.908 --> 00:37:04.744
Don't be ridiculous.

00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:06.746
You're squeaky clean.

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:09.040
-Who else washes you--
-Move.

00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:14.211
Come closer.

00:37:14.295 --> 00:37:16.505
There we go. Good job.

00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:19.258
Let's see.

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:24.055
Okay, give me your face.

00:37:24.138 --> 00:37:25.014
Good boy.

00:37:25.598 --> 00:37:27.433
Here you go.

00:37:28.142 --> 00:37:30.102
Clean behind the ears.

00:37:30.186 --> 00:37:31.896
Tip your head back. There we go.

00:37:31.979 --> 00:37:35.775
You have to clean thoroughly
if you don't want to smell.

00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:38.819
Good job. Look down.

00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:44.325
You're doing so good. Great job.

00:37:44.408 --> 00:37:46.452
Attaboy.

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:54.627
There we go. All clean.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.920
You look like a prince.

00:37:56.837 --> 00:37:59.840
Look at our little prince.

00:38:08.057 --> 00:38:09.475
Hey!

00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:11.018
What the heck are you doing?

00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:16.732
You could've just wired it.

00:38:16.816 --> 00:38:19.360
We're here to get
our debt acknowledgement form back.

00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:20.486
Is that so?

00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:23.280
I should give it back.

00:38:45.636 --> 00:38:47.555
So you have something
you're scared of now.

00:38:50.266 --> 00:38:51.308
Right?

00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:01.110
Let's go.

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:07.533
Crazy punk.

00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:44.570
What did you say?

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:50.284
Manager Ha!

00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:52.369
What on earth were you doing?!

00:39:53.746 --> 00:39:56.081
We're just trying
to handle things ourselves.

00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:05.174
Do you know how much damage you caused?

00:40:05.674 --> 00:40:08.761
Thanks to you, our ship will leave
with an empty container.

00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:11.722
Now we have to pay damages
to the buyer in secret,

00:40:11.805 --> 00:40:13.516
not to mention late fees as well!

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:16.185
-Do you know how much that is?
-Dad.

00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:22.900
That thug said if Tae-poong
doesn't bring the money,

00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:27.696
he'll kill him
and give me Tae-poong's goods.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.198
Isn't that efficient?

00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:33.202
But Kang Tae-poong made money
while you lost our company's money!

00:40:33.285 --> 00:40:36.539
Why do you only care about the result?
Think about the progress.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:39.124
I really tried my best.

00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:43.337
You're always going on and on
about that darn Typhoon Trading!

00:40:43.837 --> 00:40:45.464
You're always raving about them.

00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:46.924
Do you even…

00:40:48.008 --> 00:40:50.302
Do you have what it takes
to take Kang Tae-poong down?

00:40:50.886 --> 00:40:52.054
Do you?

00:40:54.765 --> 00:40:56.058
You punk!

00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.185
You're not in the same league as him!

00:40:58.269 --> 00:41:02.523
I set up that trading company you wanted,
so stop trying to copy Kang Tae-poong.

00:41:02.606 --> 00:41:06.235
Call your aunt and ask her to send over
some useful goods from the States.

00:41:06.318 --> 00:41:08.028
Your mom's family has good taste.

00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:10.614
Get out.

00:41:11.532 --> 00:41:13.117
-You!
-Yes, sir!

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.743
-Take him outside.
-Yes, sir.

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:16.704
Let's go.

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:19.164
Come on, let's go.

00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:23.544
Jeez.

00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:29.842
Have a good day, sir.

00:41:37.975 --> 00:41:40.603
-Hi.
-How was the expo, Mr. Kang?

00:41:40.686 --> 00:41:44.565
There were a lot of good items,
but they don't really match our vibe.

00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:47.151
Take a look at this.

00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:51.697
Electronics and chemical products.

00:41:53.907 --> 00:41:56.118
EXPORT EXPO INFORMATION

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:58.495
The bigger trading companies
handle those, don't they?

00:41:59.163 --> 00:42:00.164
I suppose so.

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:06.253
I shouldn't have repaid
the full amount to that loan shark.

00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:11.133
Never get involved
with people like that again.

00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:13.594
Even after our losses, we have a lot left.

00:42:13.677 --> 00:42:15.679
Mr. Bae.

00:42:15.763 --> 00:42:18.015
Are you studying, Mr. Bae?

00:42:18.098 --> 00:42:19.558
EXAM QUESTIONS
EXORCISM CHRONICLES

00:42:20.476 --> 00:42:23.812
Can you please respect my privacy?

00:42:26.106 --> 00:42:27.024
Gosh.

00:42:29.318 --> 00:42:30.444
Are you crying?

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.238
My gosh, he's really crying.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.783
Life is so hard.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.534
What?

00:42:39.912 --> 00:42:40.746
Here's some tissue.

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:42.998
We have a lot of good-looking folks today.

00:42:43.082 --> 00:42:44.124
KING DIAMONDS IS THE WAY TO GO!

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.209
SPECIAL LECTURE BY KIM GEUM-OK

00:42:45.292 --> 00:42:46.919
Things are really tough these days, right?

00:42:47.002 --> 00:42:49.338
-Yes!
-I'm sure it's very difficult.

00:42:49.421 --> 00:42:51.006
It's so tough.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.634
But you know, I'm not struggling at all.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:59.223
I can't help but laugh
because I'm so excited and happy.

00:42:59.723 --> 00:43:01.058
Why, you ask?

00:43:01.141 --> 00:43:04.770
Is it because 30 million won is deposited
into my bank account every month?

00:43:05.688 --> 00:43:06.897
KING DIAMONDS INCOME

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.732
KING LIFE SUCCESS LEADERSHIP ACADEMY

00:43:08.816 --> 00:43:10.234
That's incredible.

00:43:13.529 --> 00:43:14.655
Thirty million won…

00:43:15.656 --> 00:43:18.742
No, this isn't what makes me happy.

00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:25.457
I'm truly happy
because all of you can become like me.

00:43:27.418 --> 00:43:29.378
We can do it!

00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.508
Are we all alone in this?

00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.885
-Is that how Koreans are?
-No.

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.637
No, we're not.

00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:41.056
We need to stick together
and overcome this.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.267
What is that called? Networking?

00:43:44.852 --> 00:43:46.228
It's called marketing.

00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:47.896
What did I say IMF stands for?

00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:51.233
Exactly.

00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:57.906
All of you can become Rubies,
Sapphires, and a Diamond like me.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.117
Let's earn 30 million won a month,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.661
send those disobedient kids
overseas for school,

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:06.206
and gloat about it
to our annoying neighbor!

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:15.758
Our country is in danger
because of the IMF!

00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:18.594
We need your help, everyone!

00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:22.014
Please participate
in the Gold Collection Effort.

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:25.309
Our country is in danger
because of the IMF!

00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:28.353
Please participate
in the Gold Collection Effort.

00:44:28.937 --> 00:44:30.564
We must revive our country.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.277
The country is in danger.

00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:40.407
Lucky them, having gold to contribute.

00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:42.117
We must revive our country.

00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:46.163
-Please fall in line.
-Please donate

00:44:46.246 --> 00:44:48.207
any gold you're not using.

00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:50.751
Let's gather our small efforts…

00:44:50.834 --> 00:44:52.544
Who am I to help, given my situation?

00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:54.880
We must revive our country.

00:44:57.216 --> 00:45:02.179
Let's gather our small efforts
and revive our country.

00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:09.019
Please donate any gold you're not using.

00:45:11.522 --> 00:45:13.398
Our country is in danger.

00:45:15.734 --> 00:45:20.572
Let's gather our small efforts
and revive our country.

00:45:23.033 --> 00:45:25.118
You'll be proud of me, right, honey?

00:45:25.911 --> 00:45:28.163
Please donate any gold you're not using.

00:45:29.456 --> 00:45:31.041
Let's gather our small efforts…

00:45:31.792 --> 00:45:35.587
A cold, chilling wave worse
than the winter air has crashed over us,

00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:39.925
but our people's passion for the nation
is burning brightly this new year.

00:45:41.385 --> 00:45:44.763
What were your thoughts
as you brought your treasured gold?

00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:46.974
I don't know.

00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:50.602
As a proud citizen,
what would you like to say?

00:45:50.686 --> 00:45:52.187
I'm a mess right now.

00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:57.067
"The country's a mess right now."
What kind of a mess is it?

00:45:57.776 --> 00:45:58.986
Stop it.

00:46:00.153 --> 00:46:03.031
Stop! I can't let the other ladies
see me like this!

00:46:03.532 --> 00:46:06.451
-What's wrong with her?
-Let's go over there.

00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:07.661
Stop it.

00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:11.873
Are you sad to let go of your gold turtle
and your gold medal of honor?

00:46:11.957 --> 00:46:17.254
The people are struggling just to survive.
What good will these do in my closet?

00:46:17.337 --> 00:46:19.423
We have to save the country first.

00:46:20.507 --> 00:46:22.676
As you can see,

00:46:22.759 --> 00:46:27.180
true heroes exist all around the world,
no matter the era or their age.

00:46:57.252 --> 00:46:58.503
-There you are.
-Hey.

00:47:11.683 --> 00:47:13.560
We should've gone for some good food.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.688
I don't like crowded places.

00:47:20.525 --> 00:47:22.944
Is your mother doing well?

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:24.696
Probably.

00:47:27.658 --> 00:47:29.076
I don't really know either.

00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:32.663
Right now, it's every man for himself.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.212
Hey, my family went under too.

00:47:42.631 --> 00:47:43.632
Jeez.

00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:45.967
I know, dude.

00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:51.181
Even without friends,
rumors still spread like wildfire.

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.311
Sorry I couldn't go to the funeral.

00:47:57.938 --> 00:48:01.775
And I swear I'll kill
that bastard Pyo Hyun-jun someday.

00:48:03.276 --> 00:48:04.444
You're crazy.

00:48:09.074 --> 00:48:10.242
Yun-seong.

00:48:11.743 --> 00:48:14.329
There are just too many
terrible people out there.

00:48:15.038 --> 00:48:19.209
It's too exhausting
trying to hate all of them.

00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:24.965
So, let's just think about
the people we want by our side.

00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:27.467
Okay?

00:48:33.515 --> 00:48:34.516
Hold on.

00:48:35.559 --> 00:48:38.895
-What did you bring this time?
-Just hold on.

00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:40.939
I said you don't have to.

00:48:42.357 --> 00:48:43.191
Here.

00:48:43.817 --> 00:48:44.735
What's this?

00:48:45.944 --> 00:48:47.863
It's what I've been making these days.

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:52.868
I work at a helmet factory.

00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:55.078
It's popular in Europe and the US.

00:48:55.787 --> 00:49:01.293
So my boss made a fortune
and became rich even during this crisis.

00:49:02.753 --> 00:49:04.671
-Lucky him.
-Right?

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.674
Hey.

00:49:09.634 --> 00:49:11.428
Whatever you do, just stay safe.

00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:15.557
Once you get that look
in your eyes, it's all over.

00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:19.936
Once I save up,

00:49:20.604 --> 00:49:23.273
I'll get some used machinery
and start making screws.

00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:27.527
I told you.

00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:29.946
I'm going to pay you back.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.950
-I said you don't have to pay me back.
-Of course not. It's chump change.

00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:39.372
-I should go.
-Wait.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:40.957
I'm going first.

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:44.878
This is the first product I sold.

00:49:46.213 --> 00:49:47.881
-Stay safe.
-What is it?

00:49:47.964 --> 00:49:50.091
Got it? Throw this away for me.

00:49:50.175 --> 00:49:51.843
-Hey!
-See you.

00:49:56.097 --> 00:49:57.098
See you next time.

00:50:06.274 --> 00:50:07.526
He hasn't changed at all.

00:50:38.765 --> 00:50:39.724
This is nice.

00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:53.864
Jeez…

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:02.122
I got my paycheck.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.208
I wanted to pay you back first.

00:51:06.668 --> 00:51:07.586
Thanks.

00:51:17.053 --> 00:51:22.017
MOMO'S PUB

00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:19.407
What are you doing?

00:52:20.784 --> 00:52:22.160
I want to sell this.

00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:24.788
-A helmet?
-Yes.

00:52:24.871 --> 00:52:27.582
It's apparently
the number one helmet in the US.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.502
But I don't know where to begin.

00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:34.714
I really want
to sell them properly this time,

00:52:35.423 --> 00:52:37.175
but I can't use a fishing ship again.

00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:49.980
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:52.565
You're finally all here.

00:52:52.649 --> 00:52:55.318
Ms. Cha, what brings you here?

00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:57.404
My gosh.

00:52:59.322 --> 00:53:00.156
Here.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.157
CHOROK FARM GREEN JUICE

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.788
Of course you don't know.
You never learned this.

00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:10.917
You should've had your shoes
inspected by Go Ma-jin first.

00:53:11.918 --> 00:53:13.920
My shoes? Why?

00:53:15.005 --> 00:53:16.047
Put your foot up.

00:53:19.634 --> 00:53:22.303
Look here, at the toe.

00:53:22.387 --> 00:53:26.474
Is it polished until it shines?
It's your mindset when meeting a client.

00:53:27.434 --> 00:53:28.643
Now, the heel.

00:53:29.227 --> 00:53:32.772
How worn down is it?
Does it show you've been running around?

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.983
That's so old-fashioned.

00:53:35.567 --> 00:53:36.609
What's he doing here?

00:53:38.278 --> 00:53:39.904
How many have you had?

00:53:39.988 --> 00:53:43.992
-You're only drinking the ginseng too.
-I've been feeling weak lately.

00:53:44.075 --> 00:53:45.201
Jeez.

00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:47.579
Drink it then.

00:53:48.913 --> 00:53:50.498
-Thank you.
-Three.

00:53:53.418 --> 00:53:55.003
CHOROK FARM ORDER FORM
QUANTITY: 3

00:53:55.086 --> 00:53:56.171
There we go.

00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:00.633
Well, Mr. Go has been in sales
for a long time.

00:54:01.217 --> 00:54:04.929
Mr. Go may sound rough,
but he was great at his job.

00:54:05.013 --> 00:54:05.847
QUANTITY: 2

00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:14.105
QUANTITY: 4

00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:16.441
-We only need two.
-Guys.

00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:19.694
Nothing in life is free.

00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:21.821
Not age nor experience,

00:54:22.947 --> 00:54:24.365
and certainly not green juice.

00:54:28.036 --> 00:54:28.870
You're right.

00:54:29.537 --> 00:54:31.498
Work isn't something you can do alone.

00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:32.582
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:54:33.124 --> 00:54:35.460
You should keep living life your own way.

00:54:35.543 --> 00:54:36.711
Sorry?

00:54:37.462 --> 00:54:44.344
Even if you've got no money nor dignity,
all you need is someone by your side.

00:54:47.097 --> 00:54:48.556
You need people by your side.

00:54:58.858 --> 00:54:59.943
Excuse me.

00:55:06.366 --> 00:55:07.492
Pardon me.

00:55:11.663 --> 00:55:15.750
SHOE REPAIR SPECIALIST

00:55:24.134 --> 00:55:25.510
Go and eat first, Dad.

00:55:26.719 --> 00:55:27.679
Dad?

00:55:33.226 --> 00:55:35.562
You need to eat better.

00:55:36.312 --> 00:55:38.815
Let's go and eat a proper meal.

00:55:40.567 --> 00:55:41.651
Dad?

00:55:44.863 --> 00:55:46.156
You're so stingy.

00:55:47.532 --> 00:55:48.992
Seriously, so stingy.

00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:52.954
You don't even have time
to see your grandkid.

00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:57.083
My wife didn't

00:55:58.459 --> 00:56:00.086
want you skipping any meals.

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:03.756
I'm off.

00:56:05.091 --> 00:56:06.843
Stop eating that.

00:56:09.345 --> 00:56:10.305
I'm off.

00:56:19.939 --> 00:56:21.065
What are you doing?

00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:23.484
Stop it.

00:56:24.736 --> 00:56:27.614
Why are you giving this to me?

00:56:27.697 --> 00:56:30.575
Don't make your wife work.
She just had a baby.

00:56:43.296 --> 00:56:44.214
Thank…

00:57:29.676 --> 00:57:32.220
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:36.516
What are you trying to get me to do now?

00:57:37.058 --> 00:57:38.017
We're now

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.395
going to export goods.

00:57:40.478 --> 00:57:44.190
Export? I see. That's good these days.

00:57:44.274 --> 00:57:46.359
But you need the right item.

00:57:46.442 --> 00:57:48.570
Do you have someone in sales
at the company?

00:57:48.653 --> 00:57:49.988
Well…

00:57:50.071 --> 00:57:53.116
Ms. Oh is in charge.
She's now a senior staff member.

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:55.368
I see, Ms. Oh…

00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:00.999
Okay, good luck.

00:58:01.874 --> 00:58:03.042
You should join us.

00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:10.842
With what?

00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:12.218
We have the right item.

00:58:13.136 --> 00:58:15.513
But I don't know how to start.

00:58:17.473 --> 00:58:20.268
So, please teach me how to do my job.

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:27.900
No, I need to make money.
My second child was just born.

00:58:27.984 --> 00:58:30.111
I need to make money too.
This is the only way how.

00:58:30.194 --> 00:58:32.488
Your company is nothing but a name now.

00:58:32.572 --> 00:58:34.198
It's still nice

00:58:35.658 --> 00:58:36.826
having a company.

00:58:42.415 --> 00:58:43.249
Here.

00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:46.336
And I have you too.

00:58:46.419 --> 00:58:50.840
What's this? What are you doing?

00:58:50.923 --> 00:58:54.260
You have to bring that helmet
to the office tomorrow, got it?

00:58:54.344 --> 00:58:57.055
We're in big trouble if you don't, okay?

00:58:57.138 --> 00:58:58.681
Promise you will!

00:59:04.854 --> 00:59:06.773
RÉSUMÉ

00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:48.398
You must be thirsty.

They've gotten better.

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:34.986

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:38.322
JERRY MACGYVER: YOU GOT IT RIGHT

01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:47.915
Okay, three in a row!

01:00:52.003 --> 01:00:53.129
It's been eight hours.

01:00:54.881 --> 01:00:55.757
It's hot.

01:01:00.762 --> 01:01:04.432
SHAWSHANK EXEMPTION: I SHALL GET GOING NOW

01:01:07.351 --> 01:01:09.771
If there's an expiration date
on this chat room,

01:01:09.854 --> 01:01:11.564
I want it to be 10,000 years.

01:01:39.175 --> 01:01:40.468
Good morning.

01:01:47.183 --> 01:01:49.852

Thailand.

01:03:23.237 --> 01:03:25.406
It's only been two years
since helmets became mandatory.

01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:27.867
The law is going to be
much stricter this year.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.660
When will the items arrive?

01:03:29.744 --> 01:03:31.120
Who cares?

01:03:31.203 --> 01:03:33.497
Mr. Kang and I will be going anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:35.124
I work in sales too.

01:03:35.207 --> 01:03:36.876
What can you do?

01:03:36.959 --> 01:03:38.753
Where do you make these connections?

01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:41.380
The youngsters these days call it a club.

01:03:41.464 --> 01:03:43.799
-The Nihakham Group heir will be there.
-Oh, hi.

01:03:43.883 --> 01:03:45.176
Typhoon Company?

01:03:45.259 --> 01:03:46.218
Who are you?

01:03:46.302 --> 01:03:47.762
Why are you arresting us?

01:03:47.845 --> 01:03:48.679
Ms. Oh!

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:54.352
