00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.680
I'll make you some food.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Chen Jia Wen.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.720
What were you about to say?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640
I wanted to say...

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960
we...

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.879
(All encounters
will eventually end in parting)

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.040
(The outcome is already decided,
why force it?)

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
Stop drinking.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
You've had too much to drink.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120
If I drink a lot,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.240
I won't overthink things.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.480
I don't really care if you're
in a time loop or not.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Whether you love
each other or not...

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
and if you should
break up or not,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.800
you guys should know
the answer to that.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.440
What I care about more is,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
are you happy?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160
Imagine this.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.600
If he's not in your future,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.400
will you truly be happy?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560
I know Chen.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840
If you're in pain now,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.160
he must be in more pain than you.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760
If you were me,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
what would you do?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.680
If you know you will part ways
sooner or later,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.120
would you continue being together?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
Are you serious about this?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
I am.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
Dude.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520
To be honest,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720
I really envy you.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.800
At least you've never truly
lost the one you love.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.120
Because I was a coward,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.480
because I overthought things,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.480
I missed out
on my own happiness once.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.440
If I could have another chance,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.440
even if I know we'd part ways,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.640
even if it was just for a day,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.680
I'd still choose to be with her.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.760
Chen,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
don't end up like me.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.080
Cherish it.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.159
(All encounters
will eventually end in parting)

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.480
(The outcome is already decided,
why force it?)

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.480
"All encounters..."

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
"will eventually end in parting."

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.639
"The outcome is already decided."

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.080
"Why force it?"

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040
What's the point then?

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400
I don't care.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.240
But we'll part ways sooner or later.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.400
We've already been apart
for four years.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120
And what happened?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600
What if...

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.240
we can never get out of this day?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.040
Then we'll live
in the present day forever.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080
Do you realize...

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.320
that although we haven't gotten out
of this day,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.760
we seem to have gotten over it?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680
Time hasn't changed.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640
But we are free.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.320
As long as we want to,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160
we can go...

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960
wherever we want.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080
We can go...

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
as far as we want.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.520
Everything is up to us.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600
Let's get married.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.360
You mean here?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.280
We have flowers,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080
wine,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840
music,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800
guests,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280
you,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080
and me.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.920
This is a wedding venue.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.680
We can treat everyone to drinks,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.480
then dance together.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400
Will you marry me?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.520
I do.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520
Thank you, everyone.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
Please settle down a bit.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.760
I have something to say now.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480
Shen Meng.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560
You know what?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.920
You're really annoying.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.120
We've been together for four years.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.200
You meddle in everything I do.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.840
You even doubt me.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.240
I'm so tired from work,
but you don't care about me at all.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.239
When we fight,
it was clearly your fault.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.440
Why do I have to apologize?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.200
You even keep mentioning
breaking up.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.440
Okay, we've broken up now.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
But you're still the only one...

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I think about.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.000
I made a lot of money back then.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.480
But I just wanted
to spend it all on you.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480
I won big awards.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.279
I was thinking you wouldn't have
to work anymore.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.359
Let's travel the world together.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.920
That way, we can always be together.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.280
I was surrounded
by people back then too.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.720
But I just wanted to run away.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.080
I wanted to run back
to our old home.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.640
To the couch at home...

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.240
where you're on it.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.240
Honestly, I'm very grateful
for this loop.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.480
I've learned a lot.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.799
I used to blame you
for not understanding me.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.960
But I realized I was the one
who didn't understand you.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.839
You've experienced
such painful things,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.280
and I had no idea at all.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760
In the past four years,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.880
I didn't make our lives better.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.160
I know it's my fault now.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
In the future,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.040
are you still willing to be with me?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
Chen Jia Wen,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.200
why should I be with you?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.400
It's not to be richer...

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.360
or to be more successful.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.520
I've had those things before.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.400
But that's not what I want.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.400
I just want to be with you.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.120
What does being together mean?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.440
When we want to scold our bosses,
we'd do it together.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.320
When we want to make a fuss,
we'd do it together.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.960
When we want to slack off,
we'd slack off together.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.920
You always say
that I don't care about you.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.959
You're just too unobservant.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.120
You didn't notice at all.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.800
Or do you just not believe...

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.840
that I can actually
face everything with you?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.560
Thank goodness for this loop.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480
It made me realize...

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.560
how hard it is for you.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.520
It turns out you can do...

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.760
everything you said.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.840
Actually, you understand everything.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600
You know it all.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800
You just did it on purpose.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.960
You almost made us
break up for real.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760
Is it too late...

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
for me to say it now?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440
As long as you're willing to say it,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640
it's never too late.
