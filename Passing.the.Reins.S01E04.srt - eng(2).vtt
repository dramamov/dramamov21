WEBVTT

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:07.545
Our next challenge.

00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:09.581
We must get a horse at the auction.

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:11.616
Eiji Kurisu is the secretary

00:00:11.683 --> 00:00:13.785
for the Sanno Group's
Horse Racing Division.

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.889
Seeking a new racehorse,
he headed to Hokuryo Farm's premier sale.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.526
However, after a bidding war exceeding
300 million yen with Yoshihiro Shiina,

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:23.761
he missed out on the promising new horse.

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:27.098
Kurisu then recommended
a 100-million-yen colt,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.567
born at the family home of his ex,
Kanako Nozaki.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.136
Do you have the will to win?

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:33.204
-Cut it out, Dad!
-Oh, wow, well said.

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.641
What seemed like a certain falling out…

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:38.009
I'll win the G1.

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:40.445
For that, I need a Hidaka horse.

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:42.480
Let me join your dream.

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:44.015
Please, I beg you!

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:47.318
Moved by Sanno's passionate sincerity,
Takeshi softened his stance.

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.754
Kurisu's team acquired the colt,

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:53.158
named him Royal Hope,
and aimed for the Arima Kinen, but…

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:14.779
Hope!

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:24.889
See you, Hope.

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:32.030
Oh, three tail wags.

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:33.498
He's in a good mood.

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:35.500
Really?

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.970
After building up his body
for a year at Nozaki Farm,

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:43.041
Hope moved to a training farm
for basic racehorse training,

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:44.676
known as breaking.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.251
Do your best!

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:55.053
Do your best!

00:01:58.223 --> 00:01:59.857
Do your best!

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:05.830
Do your best!

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.199
Do your best!

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.920
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:31.456
Oh, it's okay.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.725
Sorry for calling you
all the way out here.

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:35.660
Where's the president?

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:38.162
He had to go to Maebashi
for his main business.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.063
My apologies.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.133
No, maybe it's for the best.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.903
I don't know what he'd say
if he saw Hope now.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.539
Let's discuss how to report it later.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:49.574
Go ahead.

00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:55.280
They say he hasn't
let his guard down at all.

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:58.616
No matter which staff member tries,
he won't run properly.

00:02:58.683 --> 00:03:00.485
He's completely uncontrollable.

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:09.861
Looking for a jockey at this stage
is virtually unheard of.

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:14.932
If we don't have a breakthrough soon,
even his debut is in jeopardy.

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.672
I've been looking for a jockey
skilled at riding difficult horses,

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:22.507
but no one is interested.

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:25.143
Isn't there one person left?

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.078
Ryujiro Saki. What about him?

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:32.483
Oh, he's a candidate,
but maybe not realistic.

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:36.454
He's a jockey in the Iwate
local racing circuit right now.

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:37.855
Iwate?

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.996
Hironaka and Kurisu
headed to Iwate to find a jockey

00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:47.699
who can handle the wild horse, Hope.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.268
SAKI STABLES

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.507
-Ryujiro.
-You actually came.

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:58.476
How are things?

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.180
Oh, just so-so.

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:07.585
Oh, right. This is Eiji Kurisu,
the one I told you about on the phone.

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.487
Please, have this.

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:11.089
Thanks.

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.858
I'm Kurisu from Royal Human.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.493
I'm Saki.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.594
SAKI STABLE, JOCKEY

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:17.628
I'm a jockey.

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:18.996
Sorry.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.798
-He's like this.
-It's fine.

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.734
Did you watch the video I sent?

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:26.037
Yeah, he's really giving you trouble.

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:27.605
It was funny.

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:32.043
Hey.

00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:34.011
Mr. Saki.

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:37.982
I watched the video of you
riding in the Teio Sho.

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.452
It may be weird to be telling you this,

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:46.491
but your racing sense and your handling
of the reins really impressed me.

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:50.094
-Well, a national horse still overtook me.
-That's not…

00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:51.896
Since your debut,

00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:55.032
you've always ranked high
among the Iwate circuit's jockeys.

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.701
Which is no surprise.

00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:59.070
No, it's nothing, really.

00:04:59.137 --> 00:05:00.972
Let me get straight to the point.

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:04.208
Would you consider riding our Royal Hope?

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:05.843
What?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.547
I told him that licenses for local
and national racing are different.

00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:11.349
-Then you know I can't.
-We'll figure it out.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:16.154
I knew it was a long shot
when I told him about you.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.589
But it's not actually impossible, right?

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.391
Ryujiro, you were originally…

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:21.492
-Tanaka.
-Yes?

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:23.828
-Contact the farrier for tomorrow.
-I will.

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:24.929
Would you…

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:27.799
consider transferring
to the national circuit?

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:30.134
Hey.

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:31.436
Don't be unreasonable.

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:34.806
If you meet Hope,
I'm sure you'll understand his appeal.

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.908
Please consider it.

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:43.614
Only if that horse truly has talent.

00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:46.984
I want horses that are easy to win with,
plain and simple.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.421
But your horse…

00:05:51.422 --> 00:05:52.657
seems questionable.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.634
Jockeys.

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:04.702
The JRA,

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:08.573
Japan's national racing authority,
currently employs about 150 jockeys.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.610
In addition,
licensed foreign jockeys also participate.

00:06:12.677 --> 00:06:14.145
To become a jockey,

00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:17.014
one must generally graduate
from a racing school,

00:06:17.081 --> 00:06:20.551
pass rigorous examinations,
and obtain a jockey license.

00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:25.156
However, local racing operates
under a different type of jockey license.

00:06:25.223 --> 00:06:27.658
Therefore, jockeys affiliated
with local racing

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:32.296
are not permitted to ride in
the national races, with some exceptions.

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:33.798
Local and National.

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:37.034
Even though they are all jockeys,
they live in different worlds.

00:06:37.802 --> 00:06:41.272
ROYAL HOPE

00:06:42.406 --> 00:06:44.775
Local racing also has many unique horses.

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.813
Jockeys must have the skill to tame them.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:55.853
I've been in a few
interleague races with him,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.922
and his riding technique is genuine.

00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:00.791
He has experience with unruly horses,

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:04.328
so Hope should be comfortable
running with him.

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:05.930
There are precedents, right?

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:08.933
People who transferred
from Local to National.

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:13.137
Only a handful.
It's that difficult a choice.

00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:16.374
If the person isn't motivated,
we can't force him to.

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:24.115
-Did you say, Ryujiro Saki?
-Yes.

00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:26.384
I see. Not bad.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.785
He's very skilled.

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:31.956
However, he's completely
unenthusiastic about transferring.

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:34.191
Oh, I see.

00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:36.193
Mr. Taira, if you know anything at all.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.529
Any intel that may help me negotiate.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:40.064
Could you tell me?

00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.366
I could, but…

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.268
Can I write about it?

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:45.269
What?

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:49.273
"Widely detested, infamous horse owner,
Kozo Sanno

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.876
appoints troublemaker, Ryujiro Saki.

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:54.145
The full story!"

00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:55.046
Troublemaker?

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:59.150
Did you know that Saki was enrolled
in the JRA Horseracing School?

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:02.720
No. So his debut was in National Racing?

00:08:02.787 --> 00:08:04.488
No, he dropped out.

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:07.224
He got involved in a fight.

00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:09.193
What?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.163
Horseracing School students,
in their second year,

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:17.201
are assigned to a stable
for practical training.

00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:20.905
That's when Saki and another student

00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:23.341
got in a fight,
right in the training center.

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:29.013
Saki, labeled a troublemaker,
got isolated at the stable and the school.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.917
Not long after, he dropped out,
went back to Morioka, his hometown,

00:08:32.984 --> 00:08:36.120
and made his debut as a Local Jockey.

00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:38.389
What was the cause of the incident?

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:41.659
Who knows? It was just some kids fighting.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.231
Man, this would make
for an interesting article!

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.701
What do you think?

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:55.206
Mr. Hironaka recommended him.
So I believe he is the right choice.

00:08:58.909 --> 00:08:59.744
What?

00:09:00.444 --> 00:09:02.980
"The Elites' Future Forecast."

00:09:03.914 --> 00:09:06.484
Oh, this is Mr. Shiina's horse.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.918
Valshare.

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:11.922
The problem is that Hope's name…

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:12.923
Is it in there?

00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:16.460
It's not.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.932
Those reporters haven't done
enough homework.

00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:24.869
Those aren't the only horses!

00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:28.706
But a horse doesn't run alone.

00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:33.144
It depends on the people around it
and the passion poured into it.

00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:37.148
So I think we can rewrite
this forecast if we want to.

00:09:38.082 --> 00:09:40.017
You're getting bolder, aren't you?

00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:42.053
Oh, my apologies.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.023
So, President,
what about Mr. Saki's transfer?

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.992
I don't like him.

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:49.460
What?

00:09:50.094 --> 00:09:53.497
Why did Hironaka choose
such a difficult guy?

00:09:54.231 --> 00:09:56.067
Shouldn't he pick one
that's won a national race?

00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.869
It's because…

00:10:01.072 --> 00:10:05.176
He is a jockey with that much potential.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.181
President.

00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:13.184
To turn the odds,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.121
sometimes we must go off the rails
and take a bold strategy.

00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:21.959
"A notable jockey transfers from Local,
choosing to ride Royal Hope!"

00:10:22.593 --> 00:10:25.029
The media would eat it up.

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:26.797
Media attention, huh?

00:10:27.431 --> 00:10:29.567
-Yes.
-Can you convince him?

00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:33.404
I will go to Iwate again.

00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:40.578
You're persistent.
I already told you it was unreasonable.

00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:44.482
All the more reason to.
The satisfaction would be immense.

00:10:44.982 --> 00:10:48.152
If you transfer and succeed in National,

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:50.755
I believe many racing fans
would be delighted.

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:54.191
That was your dream back then, right?

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.928
I apologize.

00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.965
I heard about your time
at the Horseracing School from a friend.

00:11:01.532 --> 00:11:02.533
I see.

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:05.202
How about this?

00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:12.176
If you want me, no matter what,
entrust that horse to a stable in Morioka.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.712
If you stable him here, I'll ride him.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.514
Sounds reasonable, right?

00:11:18.215 --> 00:11:19.517
I'm afraid we can't.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.620
We are aiming to win a G1,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.955
the Arima Kinen, with Royal Hope.

00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.260
I see. That's good.

00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:30.861
You dream big.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.666
Everyone wants to race nationals.

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.103
You're arrogant.

00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:42.306
-I'm done here.
-Mr. Saki!

00:11:43.107 --> 00:11:46.377
Not every jockey
can be lured by the national circuit.

00:11:58.589 --> 00:11:59.957
RYUJIRO'S FATHER

00:12:00.024 --> 00:12:03.561
His old man is a trainer in Morioka.

00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:06.764
Indeed, local racing has its own pride.

00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:08.666
I acted carelessly.

00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:12.703
I thought there was no "local"
or "national" in horse racing.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.838
What should we do?

00:12:13.904 --> 00:12:15.773
Should I look for another jockey?

00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:18.475
You do that, Mr. Hironaka.

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:22.513
I'll try to think on Mr. Saki some more.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.484
I just can't see him
as a mere troublemaker.

00:12:29.587 --> 00:12:31.288
I've confirmed the facts.

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.457
It's quite a serious problem, isn't it?

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.192
ROYAL HUMAN HR DIRECTOR

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.228
Thank you for notifying me.

00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:41.298
I will conduct
an internal investigation immediately.

00:12:41.365 --> 00:12:42.366
Really?

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:44.668
Then we'll publish this next…

00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:02.253
I'll make the payment today.

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:03.354
Thank you.

00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:07.091
Actually, I have one more thing.
A different story.

00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:09.727
Are you interested?

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:17.801
You okay?

00:13:18.602 --> 00:13:19.436
Oh, my.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.971
Hello.

00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:22.706
Oh, Ryujiro!

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:26.710
-I'll take over.
-Thanks.

00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:29.046
There, there.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.814
There, there.

00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:34.151
Huh? It hurts, doesn't it?

00:13:34.652 --> 00:13:36.287
You want to run full tilt, right?

00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:38.522
Let's take our time to heal.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.625
Take it slow.

00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:44.461
There, there.

00:13:44.962 --> 00:13:46.263
-All yours.
-Okay.

00:13:53.404 --> 00:13:54.438
How is he?

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.974
He's okay.

00:14:01.712 --> 00:14:04.014
You can still run.

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:08.452
This is why you left National
to come to Iwate!

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:15.059
That was your dream back then, right?

00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:18.862
Try saying that again!

00:14:18.929 --> 00:14:20.764
-Stop it!
-How are we different?

00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:23.100
-Hey!
-Stop it, Ryujiro!

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.235
-Let me go!
-What are you doing here?

00:14:40.117 --> 00:14:41.318
Sorry.

00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:43.487
This horse is too difficult.

00:14:43.554 --> 00:14:48.392
I understand you want to stick
to Hidaka horses, but…

00:14:49.526 --> 00:14:51.328
Thank you. I'll consider it.

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:05.009
Completely hopeless.

00:15:05.075 --> 00:15:07.144
The trainers want to give up too.

00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:09.713
Mr. Saki is our only hope.

00:15:11.382 --> 00:15:13.517
What about his assault case?

00:15:14.818 --> 00:15:17.454
I'm trying to find someone
who knows what happened.

00:15:17.521 --> 00:15:21.191
They all seem to agree
Mr. Saki was the aggressor.

00:15:21.258 --> 00:15:23.560
You'll have to ask him yourself.

00:15:23.627 --> 00:15:25.729
That's impossible.

00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:27.431
He's still wary of me.

00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:29.600
Just like Hope.

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:32.569
Indeed.

00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:40.110
Sorry for burdening you with this.

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:44.815
But please, keep doing your best.

00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:49.319
MR. TAIRA

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:50.454
Oh, it's Mr. Taira.

00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:52.756
Yes, hello?

00:15:53.323 --> 00:15:55.325
I found out who fought with Saki.

00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:56.860
What?

00:15:57.361 --> 00:15:58.629
A jockey named Matsui.

00:15:59.997 --> 00:16:04.268
His father is also a jockey,
and he's an up-and-coming rookie.

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.105
Mr. Matsui!

00:16:10.007 --> 00:16:11.842
No, he attacked me first.

00:16:12.342 --> 00:16:14.144
That was years ago.

00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:17.147
Everyone who goes to that school
has a dream, you know.

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:20.751
-Is it something one simply gives up on?
-Leave me alone.

00:16:20.818 --> 00:16:22.920
Please. Tell me something, anything.

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:23.954
Excuse me.

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:25.689
I have to go.

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:30.060
Hello.

00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:34.398
It's about Ryujiro Saki, isn't it?

00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:35.799
What?

00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:40.204
You have been asking around about him.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.072
It's become a bit of a rumor.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.308
Oh, I see.

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:46.310
I don't know what to say…

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:47.978
How embarrassing.

00:16:48.045 --> 00:16:50.481
-President, your meeting…
-I know.

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.485
Are you free tonight?

00:16:55.853 --> 00:16:57.054
What?

00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:59.857
So he rode one of your horses
during training?

00:16:59.923 --> 00:17:00.757
Yes.

00:17:00.824 --> 00:17:02.426
I remember it well.

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:05.562
He worked as hard as a professional.

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:10.400
He was dedicated
to building trust with the horses.

00:17:10.934 --> 00:17:14.404
Mr. Ogino thought highly of him.
It's a shame he got into that fight.

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:19.343
Do you know the cause?

00:17:20.844 --> 00:17:21.678
More or less.

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:25.349
That jockey, Matsui, whom you talked to…

00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:29.586
It seems he would mock Saki
about him being from a local stable.

00:17:30.154 --> 00:17:31.388
On that day too.

00:17:34.892 --> 00:17:35.893
Hello.

00:17:37.828 --> 00:17:38.996
Good morning, sir!

00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:41.064
How's our horse doing?

00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:42.199
Oh, right.

00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:44.468
Looking good.

00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:47.237
It's like he knows how to win.

00:17:48.238 --> 00:17:49.873
I think he will grow more.

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:53.744
Perhaps we'll work together someday.

00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:55.812
Keep up the good work.

00:17:56.547 --> 00:17:57.614
Yes, sir.

00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:02.553
Thank you!

00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:08.559
Sales talk, huh?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.763
It must be tough trying to get ahead.

00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:16.133
I was just talking about the horse.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.301
There aren't any…

00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:19.203
Horses like that in Morioka.

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:21.772
He's wasted on you.

00:18:25.642 --> 00:18:27.110
It's not your own talent.

00:18:27.744 --> 00:18:30.280
The horses here
are all on a different level.

00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:33.016
Compared to your local horses.

00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:38.655
Try saying that again!

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:41.558
No one defended Saki.

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:44.728
Matsui is the son
of a famous jockey, and besides,

00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:47.130
Saki threw the first punch.

00:18:47.197 --> 00:18:48.232
It was inexcusable.

00:18:48.865 --> 00:18:52.402
Still, he shouldn't have quit.

00:18:53.036 --> 00:18:54.504
If you run away, everything's over.

00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:57.274
Was this helpful?

00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.142
Thank you.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.911
It's more than enough.

00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:04.481
Valshare debuts next year.

00:19:05.282 --> 00:19:08.352
I plan to appoint Matsui as his jockey.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.054
He has grown, too.

00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:14.625
It's only natural to want
an in-demand jockey.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.103
This is an accusation regarding
double dispatching.

00:19:26.169 --> 00:19:27.537
I already gave them money.

00:19:28.238 --> 00:19:29.773
So this matter…

00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:33.310
is handled.

00:19:34.344 --> 00:19:36.546
But shady dealings continue.

00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:39.916
We need to stop
those transactions right away

00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:42.052
and reorganize the staff.

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:44.021
Can you leave this to me?

00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:46.023
I will handle this.

00:19:46.757 --> 00:19:47.658
Father.

00:19:48.258 --> 00:19:50.727
I'll make changes.
But I won't fire anyone.

00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:53.430
This is my responsibility.

00:19:55.232 --> 00:19:56.233
You sure talk big.

00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:57.968
What?

00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:01.905
One more thing I want to talk about…

00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:04.708
Oh.

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:09.346
What is it?

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:13.550
Never mind.

00:20:13.617 --> 00:20:14.451
Hey!

00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:18.522
Why not just leave it to him?

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:19.823
KOZO'S WIFE

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.991
It's unseemly…

00:20:21.992 --> 00:20:23.694
to always want to get ahead.

00:20:29.232 --> 00:20:30.701
Shorten the distance.

00:20:30.767 --> 00:20:31.668
Okay.

00:20:32.402 --> 00:20:33.403
That's right.

00:20:34.237 --> 00:20:35.739
-Don't be scared.
-Sorry.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.115
Do you have travel fees to burn?

00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:47.617
I heard your story from Mr. Shiina.

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:50.954
Let's talk again.

00:20:53.457 --> 00:20:56.126
He must also have been desperate.
Go ahead.

00:20:57.794 --> 00:21:00.864
I think he just didn't want to lose
to someone from Local,

00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:02.499
who he thinks is inferior.

00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:05.569
But…

00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:06.903
I couldn't bear it.

00:21:10.273 --> 00:21:11.708
How are we so different?

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:14.845
No matter where you're born,
people are people.

00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:16.646
Horses are horses.

00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:18.515
You're right.

00:21:19.082 --> 00:21:21.618
So can you really blame me for giving up?

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.028
It's the same with our Hope.

00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:37.234
Hope was born in Hidaka,
and his breeders had high hopes for him.

00:21:38.502 --> 00:21:43.640
But no owner believed in his ability.

00:21:45.475 --> 00:21:49.446
"If you go to Hokuryo Farm,
you can find sure-win horses."

00:21:50.414 --> 00:21:53.650
And so, they dismissed Hope.

00:21:55.852 --> 00:21:59.656
But our president declared,

00:22:02.092 --> 00:22:03.960
"We will win with a Hidaka horse."

00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:09.633
For both horse and rider,
where you are born doesn't matter.

00:22:10.867 --> 00:22:12.235
Talent is talent.

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:17.908
We will win the Arima Kinen
with Royal Hope.

00:22:19.476 --> 00:22:23.947
A Hidaka horse from a small farm
will beat Hokuryo's ones.

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:35.025
I didn't think
you were this passionate, Mr. Kurisu.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.067
We have a week to register you
for the JRA jockey license exam.

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:45.836
Please.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.673
Come with us and win the Arima.

00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:56.346
I understand how you feel.

00:22:57.647 --> 00:22:58.482
But…

00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:03.620
those feelings are not enough
to win me over.

00:23:04.688 --> 00:23:06.857
Is there nothing
that can be done with Hope?

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:10.460
We've done everything we can,
but nothing is working.

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:14.030
Does Kurisu know about this?

00:23:14.097 --> 00:23:14.931
Yes.

00:23:14.998 --> 00:23:18.602
He's still working on our last chance.

00:23:19.302 --> 00:23:22.239
I apologize for the delayed report.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.174
So?

00:23:25.842 --> 00:23:28.044
-Do you want me to give up on Hope?
-No.

00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:29.846
That's not it.

00:23:29.913 --> 00:23:30.847
Then what?

00:23:31.348 --> 00:23:33.950
It's true that if you look at Hope now

00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:36.453
and say you're aiming for Arima,
people will laugh at you.

00:23:37.521 --> 00:23:41.725
But I'm captivated by
Hope's true strength.

00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:43.927
In his refusal to yield,

00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:48.164
I feel a fighting spirit and a power
that speed alone cannot measure.

00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:52.903
Could you please trust us
and wait just a little longer?

00:23:53.937 --> 00:23:56.573
Can you bet on us?

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.275
Mr. Saki.

00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:02.045
Are you fine with running away like this?

00:24:05.482 --> 00:24:07.551
You don't understand, Mr. Kurisu.

00:24:11.288 --> 00:24:13.757
If I leave, what will happen
to this place?

00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:18.728
I left once before, aiming to go National.

00:24:20.063 --> 00:24:26.403
And then, when I turned tail and ran home,
they welcomed me back.

00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:31.508
They didn't say anything.

00:24:35.612 --> 00:24:36.680
So…

00:24:40.283 --> 00:24:42.552
Do you think I can just leave again?

00:24:46.222 --> 00:24:49.960
I'm sorry for not understanding anything.

00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:53.563
Now you know.

00:24:59.302 --> 00:25:00.937
What are you doing?

00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:03.273
Don't use us as an excuse.

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:05.609
What?

00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:10.013
Hey!

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.815
Don't mess with me!

00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:16.853
Even if you aren't here,
this place won't go under.

00:25:17.554 --> 00:25:20.857
I'll stand on my own two feet
until I die, so…

00:25:21.524 --> 00:25:23.693
Stand on your own too!

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.131
Hironaka.

00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:32.502
I've told you many times,
I don't know anything about horses.

00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:36.172
So I have no choice but to bet on you two.

00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:39.442
Don't give up.

00:25:41.144 --> 00:25:42.412
I won't either.

00:25:44.014 --> 00:25:44.848
Yes.

00:25:49.252 --> 00:25:51.488
I'm betting on me too.

00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:57.594
-Oh, thank you.
-Hello, President Okabayashi.

00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:59.129
It's been a while.

00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:00.463
You look well as always.

00:26:01.197 --> 00:26:03.233
-Sorry for the sudden call.
-It's fine.

00:26:04.668 --> 00:26:06.302
-What is it today?
-Oh, right.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.804
You're scaring me.

00:26:07.871 --> 00:26:08.705
No…

00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:10.940
SANNO BUILDING

00:26:11.007 --> 00:26:13.743
All 150 people
who were dispatched to the port

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.980
were transferred to a different industry.

00:26:17.047 --> 00:26:19.816
Of course, it was all done legitimately.

00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:22.519
No one had to be let go.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.822
Money can be recovered,

00:26:26.823 --> 00:26:29.159
but once you sack someone,
they won't come back.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.862
I always say this,
but people are our greatest asset.

00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:39.069
Oh, Chief.

00:26:39.135 --> 00:26:40.236
Excuse me.

00:26:41.071 --> 00:26:42.072
What is it?

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:43.606
Well…

00:26:44.774 --> 00:26:48.611
We've finally found a jockey
who will ride Royal Hope.

00:26:48.678 --> 00:26:51.981
A hiring?
In HR, that's all in a day's work.

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:54.451
I don't see how this is important.

00:26:56.953 --> 00:26:57.954
It's me.

00:26:58.021 --> 00:26:59.622
Regarding you-know-what,

00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:03.460
I will not be involved at all,
so do what you want.

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:12.635
Please wait!

00:27:12.702 --> 00:27:15.071
They are waiting for your reply.

00:27:15.138 --> 00:27:16.206
You do that.

00:27:16.272 --> 00:27:18.708
-No, but…
-I'm leaving it to you!

00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:22.612
At least tell me what business you are…

00:27:25.715 --> 00:27:27.884
Ms. Takeda, what's wrong?

00:27:28.418 --> 00:27:32.021
Mr. Kurisu, this needs
to be finalized today,

00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.323
but I have a meeting.

00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:34.257
Then I'll handle it.

00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:35.725
Thank you!

00:27:46.469 --> 00:27:47.537
Oh, my.

00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:50.140
-Can I pay by card?
-Yes.

00:27:56.246 --> 00:27:58.181
MAEBASHI GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:28:06.256 --> 00:28:09.125
I told you it was just an examination.

00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:12.328
I thought it was a surgery.

00:28:12.395 --> 00:28:13.763
How are you feeling?

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.298
I think I can eat today.

00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:16.666
That's good.

00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:18.902
Thank you.

00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:23.873
ROOM 121
MIKIKO NAKAJO

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.042
You're overreacting.

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:07.183
Ryujiro.

00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:09.485
He's here.

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:23.967
He's very spirited.

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:32.108
Is that so? There, there.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.612
It's your debut too.

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:39.349
I'm also trying again.

00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:46.189
Three times.

00:29:47.123 --> 00:29:48.057
What?

00:29:48.124 --> 00:29:49.626
Three tail wags.

00:29:49.692 --> 00:29:51.427
There, there.

00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:53.963
Shall we run together?

00:29:55.465 --> 00:29:57.567
Okay. There, there.

00:29:58.534 --> 00:29:59.669
One, two.

00:30:00.637 --> 00:30:01.571
Okay.

00:30:02.438 --> 00:30:04.707
There, there. Let's do our best.

00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:08.645
Let's go. Good boy.

00:30:09.212 --> 00:30:12.081
Okay. Calm down. Take your time.

00:30:12.148 --> 00:30:13.416
Hello.

00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:15.051
Even if we're behind schedule,
don't panic.

00:30:15.118 --> 00:30:16.552
Yes, I understand.

00:30:18.988 --> 00:30:20.256
RIDING TECHNIQUES
NATIONAL CIRCUIT EXPLAINED

00:30:20.323 --> 00:30:21.858
NATIONAL CIRCUIT JOCKEY EXAM

00:30:25.461 --> 00:30:27.797
That's good.

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:31.467
VALSHARE

00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:37.874
There, there.

00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:40.076
There, there.

00:30:56.993 --> 00:30:58.261
Ryujiro.

00:30:59.095 --> 00:31:00.196
The exam…

00:31:00.263 --> 00:31:02.031
The exam results…

00:31:05.702 --> 00:31:07.036
Congratulations.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.811
I thought once he got in the JRA,
he would want to start racing immediately.

00:31:15.345 --> 00:31:18.581
But he insisted on debuting with Hope.

00:31:19.682 --> 00:31:21.684
He's a great person.

00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:23.252
I'm sure you will like him.

00:31:23.886 --> 00:31:25.688
Let's see him run first.

00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:30.126
Ryujiro.

00:31:30.626 --> 00:31:31.461
Hey.

00:31:39.702 --> 00:31:42.972
Is that him? What a playboy.

00:31:43.873 --> 00:31:46.009
His appearance is rather unique.

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:04.360
What?

00:32:05.228 --> 00:32:06.195
Who is it?

00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:08.798
-Hello!
-Ryujiro's parents.

00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:09.699
Please follow me.

00:32:09.766 --> 00:32:12.135
No, we'll stay here.

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:13.736
Oh, but…

00:32:14.637 --> 00:32:17.807
Don't tell him we came. Please.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.078
Understood.

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:26.716
-Please give this to him.
-Of course.

00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:31.554
For getting him to come all this way…

00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:33.756
Thank you so much.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.559
Oh, I didn't do anything…

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.529
He's a wonderful manager.

00:32:54.077 --> 00:32:54.911
Good job!

00:32:54.977 --> 00:32:56.345
Thanks.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.514
-Good job.
-Thanks.

00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:01.884
What? What is this?

00:33:01.951 --> 00:33:02.985
Gomasuri dango!

00:33:03.052 --> 00:33:05.121
Nice one, Mr. Kurisu.

00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:13.396
When I was at the Horseracing School,

00:33:15.598 --> 00:33:21.671
my parents would bring some
when they came for the annual meeting.

00:33:21.737 --> 00:33:22.572
GOMASURI DANGO

00:33:22.638 --> 00:33:25.074
That school's diet restrictions
are very strict.

00:33:25.975 --> 00:33:29.545
So I looked forward to these.

00:33:35.852 --> 00:33:36.786
Yeah.

00:33:39.122 --> 00:33:40.056
This is it.

00:33:44.927 --> 00:33:46.762
Oh, right. Mr. Kurisu.

00:33:46.829 --> 00:33:47.663
Yes?

00:33:48.264 --> 00:33:51.334
From now on, call me Ryujiro.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.435
What?

00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:55.138
That's my lucky charm.

00:33:55.771 --> 00:33:58.241
Then I'll tell the president that.

00:33:58.307 --> 00:33:59.775
No, you do it too.

00:33:59.842 --> 00:34:01.711
But I'm just his secretary.

00:34:01.777 --> 00:34:03.146
We're a team, though.

00:34:03.212 --> 00:34:04.714
Oh, my.

00:34:05.314 --> 00:34:06.382
Well then…

00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:09.018
Ryujiro.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.221
Jeez, you're making it weird!

00:34:12.288 --> 00:34:13.156
Don't blush.

00:34:13.222 --> 00:34:15.424
I'll get used to it, gradually.

00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:16.459
Okay.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.165
How did I do?

00:34:23.366 --> 00:34:24.467
On today's run.

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.802
Your honest thoughts.

00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:29.839
I'll buy one.

00:34:30.806 --> 00:34:31.941
A betting ticket.

00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:33.809
I'll bet on you.

00:34:35.645 --> 00:34:36.679
Okay.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.915
Thank you.

00:34:42.718 --> 00:34:44.720
Oh, it hurts!

00:34:44.787 --> 00:34:47.323
-Did he bite you again?
-Yes!

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:50.059
Tomorrow is his debut.
He's probably pumped up.

00:34:50.126 --> 00:34:52.028
-Do you get bitten too, Ms. Yasukawa?
-Me?

00:34:52.094 --> 00:34:53.563
No, I don't.

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:54.597
Why?

00:34:57.667 --> 00:34:58.801
What are the odds?

00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:02.672
Tenth out of twelve horses, 101.9.

00:35:05.608 --> 00:35:06.876
Which is the favorite?

00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:10.346
The one we failed to get.

00:35:10.913 --> 00:35:12.181
Valshare.

00:35:12.248 --> 00:35:14.350
Mr. Shiina's horse.

00:35:14.417 --> 00:35:15.985
Thank you for waiting.

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:19.889
-Congrats on your debut race!
-Yes!

00:35:21.857 --> 00:35:23.659
Gotta show the kid a good race.

00:35:24.927 --> 00:35:25.962
Hope!

00:35:27.163 --> 00:35:28.864
ROYAL HOPE

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.938
Well then, please do your best.

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:37.907
Long time no see.

00:35:43.112 --> 00:35:45.748
I apologize for the trouble
I caused back then.

00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:48.384
I'm excited for our race.

00:35:52.955 --> 00:35:54.757
-I'll come by later.
-Understood.

00:36:01.497 --> 00:36:04.000
I'll teach you the difference
in our levels.

00:36:09.105 --> 00:36:10.606
A message from the president.

00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:16.379
"No matter what, we will not remove you.

00:36:16.912 --> 00:36:20.082
Don't focus on immediate wins.
I want you to nurture Hope."

00:36:21.984 --> 00:36:23.119
I told you before,

00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:26.389
it's up to Hope whether I keep riding him.

00:36:28.391 --> 00:36:29.892
"Immediate wins"?

00:36:32.061 --> 00:36:35.731
-Of course I ride to win.
-Stop!

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:37.900
Leading jockey, you say?

00:36:37.967 --> 00:36:40.269
But that was in Local, right? I wonder.

00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:43.639
And he's on a Royal horse
with an unknown pedigree.

00:36:43.706 --> 00:36:45.708
A horse from Hidaka.

00:36:47.143 --> 00:36:47.977
Yes.

00:36:48.044 --> 00:36:49.712
Valshare's a sure win.

00:36:54.884 --> 00:36:56.419
I think so too.

00:36:59.689 --> 00:37:03.793
But what are these
expectations I'm having?

00:37:29.118 --> 00:37:31.187
Tokyo Racecourse Fourth Race,

00:37:31.253 --> 00:37:33.756
Make Debut Tokyo,
Two-Year-Old Newcomer Race.

00:37:33.823 --> 00:37:36.192
The 12 runners are entering the track.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.561
On the topic of debuts,

00:37:38.627 --> 00:37:42.031
one of the jockeys, Ryujiro Saki,
has been active in Iwate racing,

00:37:42.098 --> 00:37:45.067
and he will be making
his national debut in this race.

00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:46.435
Let's look forward to it.

00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:49.405
His aggressive riding style
is his trademark,

00:37:49.472 --> 00:37:51.640
but the JRA circuit is unfamiliar to him.

00:37:51.707 --> 00:37:54.510
Let's see what kind of race he'll give us!

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.647
Hello.

00:37:58.714 --> 00:38:00.916
Hope looks a bit nervous.

00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:03.452
TOKYO FOURTH RACE - MAKE DEBUT TOKYO
TWO-YEAR-OLDS

00:38:08.758 --> 00:38:10.459
Is that our new jockey uniform?

00:38:10.526 --> 00:38:12.428
It looks great on the turf.

00:38:14.697 --> 00:38:16.465
Tokyo Racecourse, Race Four,

00:38:16.532 --> 00:38:18.901
Make Debut Tokyo Two-Year-Old
Newcomer Race.

00:38:18.968 --> 00:38:21.470
Contested over 1,600 meters
on turf with 12 horses.

00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:22.805
-Take pictures of Hope.
-What?

00:38:22.872 --> 00:38:25.274
-Not Valshare?
-It's fine, get Hope!

00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:27.309
The start is from the backstretch.

00:38:27.376 --> 00:38:30.713
Number 11, the favorite, Valshare,
heads to the gate.

00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:32.882
Oh, no.

00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:36.485
Number 12, Royal Hope,
is resisting going to the gate.

00:38:36.552 --> 00:38:39.722
-Hope…
-Number 12 is refusing to enter.

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:41.624
It's okay.

00:38:42.691 --> 00:38:43.793
I'm here with you.

00:38:45.661 --> 00:38:46.695
We're together.

00:38:48.397 --> 00:38:49.565
Let's have fun.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.974
Royal Hope is now entering the gate,
guided by the handler.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.984
Now, being urged forward
to Gate 12 is Royal Hope.

00:39:09.051 --> 00:39:10.986
The handler moves away.

00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:30.573
They're off!

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:33.175
-Number 12, Royal Hope, is slow to start.
-Oh, no.

00:39:33.242 --> 00:39:35.811
-What are you doing?
-Jockey Ryujiro Saki is trying to recover!

00:39:35.878 --> 00:39:37.346
Now, the battle for the lead!

00:39:37.413 --> 00:39:40.049
From the outside, Number 11, Valshare,
and Number Nine, Lovely Mood.

00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:41.617
-Valshare takes the lead!
-Yes!

00:39:41.684 --> 00:39:43.352
Second is Number Nine, Lovely Mood,

00:39:43.419 --> 00:39:45.154
with Number Four,
Classic Issue, right behind.

00:39:45.221 --> 00:39:47.156
-Lining up is Kogarashi Lady.
-Hope.

00:39:47.223 --> 00:39:48.791
The second group is a cluster of three.

00:39:48.858 --> 00:39:50.860
Number Eight, Lalatint,
joins them from the outside.

00:39:50.926 --> 00:39:52.962
-Making a group of four.
-Hang on, Ryujiro!

00:39:53.028 --> 00:39:55.865
That's it. Rein him in.

00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:57.867
A half-length back
is Number Seven, Week Will,

00:39:57.933 --> 00:39:59.935
and a length back is Number Ten, Zelrid.

00:40:00.002 --> 00:40:02.705
Another two lengths back
is Number Five, Pioneer Sea.

00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:04.740
And Number 12, Royal Hope,
is at the very rear.

00:40:05.808 --> 00:40:06.709
It's okay.

00:40:06.775 --> 00:40:08.277
No need to rush.

00:40:10.212 --> 00:40:12.781
Rounding the third corner.
Number 11, Valshare, is in the lead.

00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:15.017
-A one-length lead. Passing 800 meters.
-Okay.

00:40:15.084 --> 00:40:17.353
In second is Number Nine, Lovely Mood.

00:40:17.419 --> 00:40:20.556
-Do your best!
-Kogarashi Lady and Classic Issue!

00:40:20.623 --> 00:40:22.191
Fifth is Number Eight, Lalatint.

00:40:22.258 --> 00:40:25.227
Behind them is Number Two, Angie Rose,
and on the inner rail, Gear Finale.

00:40:25.294 --> 00:40:27.930
Rounding the fourth corner,
they head into the homestretch!

00:40:30.232 --> 00:40:31.734
Can you hear them?

00:40:32.301 --> 00:40:33.636
Amazing, right?

00:40:36.872 --> 00:40:37.706
Let's go!

00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:54.189
Perfect unity.

00:40:54.256 --> 00:40:56.959
Now, Number 11, Valshare,
is still in the lead.

00:40:57.026 --> 00:40:58.561
-Can Valshare do it?
-Hope!

00:40:58.627 --> 00:41:00.095
-Hope!
-The long straight!

00:41:00.963 --> 00:41:04.266
Here, Number 12, Royal Hope,
shifted to the outside!

00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:06.368
The leader, Valshare,
passes the 400-meter mark.

00:41:06.435 --> 00:41:10.439
-Do it, Hope!
-Surging from the outside is Royal Hope!

00:41:10.506 --> 00:41:12.274
-Do it!
-Get the pictures!

00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.410
Hope moves from fourth to third!

00:41:14.476 --> 00:41:18.147
Royal Hope's great speed
closes in on Valshare!

00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:19.848
Hang in there!

00:41:19.915 --> 00:41:22.051
-Go!
-Faster!

00:41:22.117 --> 00:41:23.919
-Hope, come on!
-Hope!

00:41:23.986 --> 00:41:26.388
Go!

00:41:26.455 --> 00:41:30.659
Climbing the hill,
Royal Hope caught Valshare!

00:41:30.726 --> 00:41:33.162
Royal Hope has overtaken Valshare!

00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:34.863
-Go, Hope!
-Royal Hope…

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.665
-Go!
-Leaving the rest behind…

00:41:36.732 --> 00:41:38.701
Royal Hope takes the lead!

00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:40.903
Royal Hope has an overwhelming margin!

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.372
-Goal in!
-Yes!

00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:47.743
Royal Hope and Jockey Ryujiro Saki
both mark a brilliant debut!

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.211
-He did it!
-Congratulations!

00:41:49.278 --> 00:41:52.748
The favorite, Valshare,
finishes in second!

00:41:53.382 --> 00:41:55.618
-What incredible speed, Royal Hope!
-Congratulations!

00:41:57.653 --> 00:42:00.222
We won! Hope did it!

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:02.224
-Number Nine, Lovely Mood.
-He did it!

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:04.193
Tokyo Racecourse Fourth Race,
Make Debut Tokyo.

00:42:04.259 --> 00:42:05.594
-Father…
-Hope…

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.765
We did it!

00:42:16.038 --> 00:42:16.872
Thank you!

00:42:16.939 --> 00:42:18.674
Father, Hope…

00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:19.875
Thank you.

00:42:20.909 --> 00:42:22.878
-Thank you.
-Hope…

00:42:25.047 --> 00:42:26.515
Hope won.

00:42:38.927 --> 00:42:39.795
Thank you.

00:42:40.596 --> 00:42:41.697
Hey, kid.

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:47.336
Sorry, please look at the camera.

00:42:49.738 --> 00:42:52.775
To the victory of the Royal Family.

00:42:52.841 --> 00:42:55.944
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:57.880
Wait. Why are you taking charge?

00:42:57.946 --> 00:42:59.915
-We're a family, right?
-Family.

00:42:59.982 --> 00:43:01.950
Sorry, he fell asleep.

00:43:02.017 --> 00:43:03.152
It's okay.

00:43:03.218 --> 00:43:04.620
Sleep well, grow well.

00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:08.490
President.

00:43:10.793 --> 00:43:14.196
Please let me ride that horse
until you don't need me anymore.

00:43:14.263 --> 00:43:15.497
Please.

00:43:17.466 --> 00:43:18.467
I'm counting on you.

00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:23.939
Thanks!

00:43:25.874 --> 00:43:26.942
Thanks.

00:43:28.644 --> 00:43:31.447
President. Hope.

00:43:31.513 --> 00:43:33.515
And Ryujiro Saki.

00:43:33.582 --> 00:43:35.984
I like that they all have
their own struggles.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.388
Let's eat.

00:43:40.422 --> 00:43:42.291
-Mr. Kurisu.
-Yes?

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:46.829
I think the article
will take a bit longer.

00:43:47.863 --> 00:43:50.065
I want to see you guys reach the goal,

00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:55.504
then tell the fans
that a loving family like this exists.

00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.108
I understand.

00:43:59.174 --> 00:44:01.944
By the way,
can we change the jockey silks?

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.779
They're so tacky, aren't they?

00:44:03.846 --> 00:44:07.149
If we're going to win the Arima,
that silk's too…

00:44:07.216 --> 00:44:08.183
Hey, Ryujiro.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.318
You're going too far.

00:44:09.818 --> 00:44:10.986
But, Mr. Hironaka…

00:44:12.087 --> 00:44:13.122
All right.

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:15.124
-I'll change them.
-What?

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.558
-Oh, wow!
-You approve?

00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:17.526
Here we go!

00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:19.561
But no flamboyant stuff!

00:44:19.628 --> 00:44:22.531
Come on, President,
let's think about this.

00:44:22.598 --> 00:44:24.433
Their winning streak starts now.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.636
Without a doubt,
Hope will be the center of his generation.

00:44:27.703 --> 00:44:31.507
Kurisu and everyone on the team
had that feeling.

00:44:32.307 --> 00:44:33.208
At least for now.

00:44:35.144 --> 00:44:37.646
I get my treatment at ten, okay?

00:44:39.815 --> 00:44:40.949
Got it.

00:44:43.152 --> 00:44:45.587
Buy me a cream puff as a treat.

00:44:46.088 --> 00:44:47.022
You can't eat those.

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:48.924
I want to.

00:44:49.925 --> 00:44:52.427
Cake would be fine too.

00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:58.367
Got it. I'll go buy one.

00:45:01.303 --> 00:45:03.238
I'll buy it, so…

00:45:05.908 --> 00:45:07.409
Do your best, Mom.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:09.912
Thank you, Koichi.

00:45:13.649 --> 00:45:14.583
Mr. Kurisu.

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:16.652
Have you read this?

00:45:17.286 --> 00:45:18.420
What?

00:45:19.988 --> 00:45:21.557
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:24.726
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

00:45:24.793 --> 00:45:25.460
Excuse me.

00:45:27.496 --> 00:45:28.530
You dropped this.

00:45:29.031 --> 00:45:30.732
Thank you.

00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:40.042
I'll handle it myself.

00:45:40.108 --> 00:45:43.378
I still haven't found the courage
to tell him about his father.

00:45:43.445 --> 00:45:45.614
I'm cheering for Royal Hope.

00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:49.051
You have a mission, to take Hope to Arima.

00:45:49.117 --> 00:45:50.052
