00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.370
(X Theater)

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.830
Where is Mengmeng?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.700
(First Aid Room)

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.940
Who here
is Chen Yiting's family?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.780
I am.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.990
Doctor, how is my daughter?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.580
We've tried everything.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.270
But the fever
won't go down.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.270
Does anyone in your family
take sleeping pills?

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.190
The Lab Test Results
came out.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.550
It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.950
If the high fever persists,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.180
it could cause brain damage.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.390
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.950
I was just about to call you.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.070
The child has woken up.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.670
Mengmeng.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.830
Mengmeng.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.830
Mengmeng.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.350
Mengmeng, you're awake.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.860
Doctor.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.620
What's wrong with her?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.830
I reminded you before.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.110
To be mentally prepared.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.830
Her fever lasted so long

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.460
that she got brain damage.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.390
I... I don't understand what you mean.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.460
Cranio-cerebral Injury

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.540
can lead to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.580
developmental regression.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.550
As for the severity of the symptoms,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.230
we need to wait and see.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.300
Doctor.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.740
Can she be cured?

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.270
It will take time.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.020
Mom.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.950
It's okay.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.420
=Persona=
=Episode 9=

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.020
That day, as soon as I got home,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.620
I saw sleeping pills
scattered on the floor.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.620
I never thought I'd been living in a fog

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.550
and end up hurting Mengmeng.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.820
Don't think that way.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.860
Mengmeng wouldn't either.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.380
She only wants you to be okay.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.940
You didn't see her then.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.230
I was so scared.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.620
If she stays like this forever,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.670
what will we do?

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.150
I'm wondering if she's in pain.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.230
She's so little right now.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.620
Will it hurt more as she grows up?

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.150
I even thought

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.990
maybe we should just
end it all together.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.500
If we both died,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.590
maybe we'd both be free
from this suffering.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.620
But when I look at her

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.860
(Fear's okay)
trying so hard to call me "mom",

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.180
and she smiles at me

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.260
to cheer me up.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.230
Then another voice appeared in my mind.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.900
I think

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.620
maybe she can be cured.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.420
What if she gets cured.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.350
So I think

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.420
don't leave.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.300
Just stay.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.060
At least...

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.620
At least Ma Weicheng
can still pay for Mengmeng's treatment.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.860
It doesn't matter if he controls me.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.420
For Mengmeng, I can do anything.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.350
I just tell myself not to
think about it.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.230
Just live a bit more numb.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.820
Anyway, time will pass quickly.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.500
Mr. Carnegie once said,

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.820
if you want both happiness and success,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.710
you must find joy in your work.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Zhang Yan

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.180
has found joy in her work.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.500
She is the best example of this.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.740
That's why she has achieved so much.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.340
(Gold Sales Champion)

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.940
Let's give her a round of applause.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.790
Miss, could you help me find Ma?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.110
I have something urgent.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.910
Aunt, Mr. Ma is not here.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.470
Maybe come back another day.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.260
- Or could you call him?
- Godmother.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.420
Why are you here?

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.430
Kid.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.030
Hurry and help me find Ma.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.230
It's urgent.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.110
I called him,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.470
but he wouldn't pick up.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.740
Relax, what happened?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.230
What's wrong?

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.150
My husband fell in the bathroom

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.740
this morning.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.740
And he broke his femoral head.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.060
The doctor said
he needs surgery right away.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.990
But my money...

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.060
I invested it all into your shop.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.940
I need to withdraw it.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.500
I need my money back.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.110
What investment?

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.300
When did our store ask for investments?

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.420
You... you didn't know?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.550
Ma approached me privately.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.230
He said about the new branch.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.030
Since I've spent so much
on membership cards

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.620
and I'm a long-time customer,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.260
he asked
if I wanted to be a shareholder.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.500
He said shareholders can

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.910
get discounts on products.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.420
And I could also receive dividends.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.470
Ma gave me dividends for two months.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.790
But now,
but now my husband is in trouble.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.380
I need to use money.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.230
I have to hurry...

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.380
Kid, help me figure this out.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.260
I can only count on you.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.180
Okay.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.180
Then I'll go ask.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.740
- Wait for me.
- Alright, alright.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.230
I'll wait for your news.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.580
Come in.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.300
(Welcome to Jiankanglu)

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.910
Mr. Ma.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.590
Ms. Li is here.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.470
She said her husband needs surgery
and requires money.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.500
She had invested in our business before.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.860
It was handled by you.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.230
She's asking
if she can get her money back.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.020
You really think
you're her real daughter?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.070
Mengmeng's condition means

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.990
we'll need more money later.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.070
Who has time for other people's affairs?

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.140
Just say something

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.540
to send her away.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.380
Mr. Ma.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.790
Go ahead.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.990
You can do it.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.740
Kid, how is it going?

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.950
Godmother,
maybe you should go home for today.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.110
I'll think of another way.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.310
What's wrong?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.990
Ma refused, didn't he?

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.780
Tell me, is he inside?

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.900
No, I'll go find him myself.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.590
- That's my own money.
- Godmother.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.950
I must get that money back!

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.020
Ms. Li.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.220
Come here.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.830
Ms. Li.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.900
The money you invested

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.950
cannot be returned.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.710
I was very clear with you
from the start.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.660
This money

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.740
was for our new branch in Zhangzhou.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.660
The branch is already open.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.990
How can we return the money?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.140
Wait,
I don't want the dividends anymore.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.430
Ma, just return my principal to me.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.540
I don't need the full amount.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.190
Keep whatever you've spent.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.260
Just give me back
a couple hundred thousand, please.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.430
Ms. Li, Ms. Li.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.230
How about you think it over again?

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.860
After all, this investment

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.710
gives you thousands
in dividends each month.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.230
Where else get a deal this good?

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.190
If I had another way,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.430
I wouldn't be here.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.900
- Wait, don't do this.
- Get up first.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.260
I treated you all like family.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.350
- Please!
- We can't take this.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.190
- Get up first.
- Save my husband, okay?

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.230
Get up first, get up.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.190
No, if you don't agree, I won't get up.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.310
Alright, I promise you.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.710
Come on, get up now.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.580
Then...

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.460
Ms. Li.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.780
If this company were mine,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.540
I'd give you the money right now.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.760
- So...
- But I am just an agent.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.190
How about this.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.350
Give me some time.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.230
Trust me.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.660
I'll call headquarters.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.470
See if there's a special procedure

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.430
we can apply for.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.620
Then we return your shares to you, okay?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.070
Alright, then my spouse can be saved.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.470
But, but...

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.780
Headquarters is overseas.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.070
There's a time difference.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.930
Once they start work,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.380
I will give them a call.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.220
Alright?

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.900
Go back and take care of uncle.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.070
Don't overthink.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.910
Here, Manager Zhang.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.900
See Aunt out.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.110
Alright.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.260
Ma, I'll wait for your news.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.830
Ma, let me know as soon as
you have news.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.780
Okay.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.190
Have you eaten?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.660
Yes, you go ahead.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.620
Alright.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.030
What's wrong?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.500
Need money?

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.590
For Mengmeng's recovery,

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.070
the hospital needs payment.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.430
Don't use that card.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.830
That card has no money.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.780
What does the hospital need money for?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.230
You can ask them to contact me directly.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.860
You've already spent so much
on Mengmeng.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.140
From now on,
let's manage our own expenses.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.500
Give me my money.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500
Your money.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.190
You don't have any money left.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.140
Don't think I don't know.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.700
You...

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.020
just want to use my money

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.780
to pay back your so-called godmother.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.070
You never intended to refund her.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.740
That's her spouse's life-saving money.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.020
How can you be so cruel?

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.860
We don't have the Zhangzhou store.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.710
You kept all that money for yourself.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.140
You need to understand

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.310
who is really on your side.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.270
Is it your dad?

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.380
Your mom?

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.780
Or that ex-husband?

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.020
Did any of them care
if you lived or died?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.070
Now you're taking my money for them.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.540
How can you be so shameless?

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.310
You'd better
keep your mouth shut about this.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.470
What if one day

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.430
Mengmeng gets in trouble

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.320
and we need money.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.780
What will we do?

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.690
(Kid, when will I get my refund?)

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.540
(The hospital is urging me again)

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.780
(I went to your store)

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.780
(You weren't there, and neither was Ma.)

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.260
(Are you guys lying to me)

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.990
Did you see that?

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.830
She's back at work.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.500
I thought she had resigned.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.990
Probably thinks
the old lady's problem is over.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.870
So she came.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.740
What happened to that old lady?

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.670
I don't know.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.430
Those days she came making a scene.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.630
No one dared to deal with her.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.100
Better not to ask too much.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.060
You're Zhang Yan, right?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.150
(Police)
There is a case.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.390
Please come with us

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.260
for the investigation.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.100
Li Bingmei was your client, right?

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.260
Yes.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.820
She bought some health products
at our store.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.580
I was the one who served her.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.390
Did you know your store

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.780
planned to open a new branch?

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.910
Did you know Ma Weicheng
tricked customers into investing

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.500
in the name of opening a new store?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.230
Just say whatever you know.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.580
Don't hold back.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.470
Li Bingmei invested 200,000 yuan.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.670
This is her mobile phone.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.340
Her last text message

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.500
and phone call

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.780
were both to you.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.820
Since we called you over,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.100
it means we already have

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:55.990
certain leads.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.190
Did Ms. Li call the police?

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.230
She jumped off a building.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.630
Now you understand how serious this is?

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.020
How is Aunt Li now?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.020
Still in hospital, critical care.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.190
We don't know if she'll wake up.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.430
I didn't expect
it would turn out like this.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.270
Officer.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.470
I really didn't expect this.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.230
When her son reported it,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.430
he said his dad passed away
before getting surgery.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.540
All because the money was stolen.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.470
His mom couldn't live with the guilt.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.630
Right after his dad's funeral,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.260
she jumped.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.420
Zhang Yan.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.990
What's done is done.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.670
Feeling sad or guilty won't help.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.020
Because the amount
involved in this case is large

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.950
and the victim was seriously injured,

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.630
the circumstances are extremely bad.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.340
The only thing you can do now

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.820
is to assist the police.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.950
To bring the criminal to justice.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.780
And give the victim justice.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:16.860
Do you understand?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.260
Ma Weicheng, right?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.950
You are suspected of fraud.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.300
Come with us.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.950
Sorry, no time today.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.470
When the cop first questioned me,

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.780
I didn't dare say anything.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.260
Officer.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.500
- But Ms. Li's family is destroyed.
- You got it wrong.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.060
I felt if I were so selfish,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.060
letting Ma Weicheng get away with it.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.190
How am I any different from him?

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.500
So I told the police

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.780
everything I knew.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.670
My mind went blank then.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.390
My only thought was to
take Mengmeng and run.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.340
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.950
It's okay now. It's okay.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:56.790
Mommy is here.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.580
But Hong,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.190
I'm really scared.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.060
You're scared he'll show up again.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.380
Right?

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.140
Yes.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.260
And sometimes I can really see him.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.950
I just see him at my doorstep.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.580
Sometimes it's on the street.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.190
I don't dare take the bus.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.230
I'm afraid to go out.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.580
Sometimes I don't even dare
let people see my face.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.950
Even though I clearly know

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.100
he has already been sentenced.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.670
But you are still afraid.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.340
Because you can't tell
if what you're seeing is an illusion

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.300
or real.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.150
This kind of fear

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.500
constantly hangs over you.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.470
Suffocating you.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.390
Yes.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.540
Because I felt the same way.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.780
You know...

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.670
when I saw Kaifu...

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.020
Seeing Kaifu lying there,

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.710
I felt like my world fell apart.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.020
I didn't have any other thoughts then.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.860
I just thought

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.630
I should go with him.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.740
I might as well die too.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.870
But I couldn't.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.990
I must take revenge.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.430
I was insane back then.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:00.430
Just wanted revenge.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.300
I was going to kill Huang Shuquan.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.470
After I killed him

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.540
I thought I would feel

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.870
relief.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.580
Justice served.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.780
But it's not.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.580
Killing is not bravery.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.990
During my year and a half on the run,

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.870
I also seem to always see him.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.430
Sometimes

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.990
I'd see Kaifu.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.900
I...

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:02.750
really...

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.470
really miss him.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.910
But what's even scarier is

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.870
I'd also see Huang Shuquan.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.780
Saw him while eating.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.950
Saw him while sleeping.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.990
Saw him when I was doing hard labor.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.230
Sometimes, sleeping under a bridge,

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.190
I'd turn around and see his face.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.340
This fear

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.340
suffocated me.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.990
So I know what you're saying.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.500
I understand how you feel.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.150
Until I met Danshun again.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.710
Saw you,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.710
Mengmeng,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.390
and all these beautiful things.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.430
Thank you.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.190
During the time I was with Danshun,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.020
I also felt saved by him.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.100
I thought I could finally

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.390
get out of that pain.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.910
But he still didn't let me go.

(Star Special Education Center)

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.100
A few months ago,

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.390
I went to pick up Mengmeng.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.270
Teacher,

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.940
where's Mengmeng?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.990
Your friend is with her
in the rehab room.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.820
What friend?

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.190
That man said he is your friend.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.260
Come on, Mengmeng.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.230
Go, Mengmeng.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.500
Yes, a little higher.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.910
Come on, Mengmeng.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.780
Mengmeng.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.940
- Mengmeng.
- Go.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.940
Mengmeng.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.580
Mengmeng.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.670
Didn't I tell you

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.060
not to play on this?

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.310
Let's go.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.230
Long time no see.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.100
Not even a greeting?

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.740
I have nothing to do with you anymore.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.020
Nothing?

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.870
Mengmeng has improved so much.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.340
You've changed too.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.940
Confident.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:46.990
Beautiful.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.140
Independent.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.230
Nothing like the old you.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.340
Don't come near us again.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.740
You were the one
who gave the police evidence, huh?

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.020
Our fate isn't over yet.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.830
We'll meet again.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.550
Bye bye, Mengmeng.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:20.750
Danshun.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.150
I want to discuss something with you.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.550
Go ahead.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.630
I took Mengmeng for a check-up today.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.950
The doctor said
a hospital in Xiamen

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:34.950
is very suitable for her.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.540
How about we move to Xiamen?

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.470
Maybe wait a bit longer.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:45.780
Wait for what?

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.390
We've just started to
make some progress here.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.870
The cost of living in Xiamen
is also high.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.950
Then how long do we have to wait?

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.230
Let me save up a bit more money.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.670
So you and Mengmeng
won't have to struggle there.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.740
What's wrong?

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.430
You seem distracted lately.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.060
Is something going on?

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.470
Nothing.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.100
Let's sleep.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.580
Coming.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.430
You forgot your keys today?

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.910
It's fine. It's fine.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.020
Don't be nervous.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.380
I just say something.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.420
Then I'll leave.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.340
Not bad.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.430
Living comfortably.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.430
Even has a balcony.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.870
Very cozy.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.510
Mengmeng.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.780
Miss uncle?

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.620
Mengmeng.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.560
Mengmeng.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.950
Let's go inside and play.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.630
Mengmeng.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.870
Play with the bunny first.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.870
Don't come out.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.740
Your boyfriend doesn't smoke?

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.340
What exactly do you want to do?

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.060
You're in a hurry?

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.670
Let me show you something.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.430
What's wrong?

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.910
You're shameless!

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.780
It was hard to record this.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.740
I know you'll leave me someday.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.740
Without something in my hand,

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.990
I can't feel at ease.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.580
You know?

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.300
After I came out, I really had nothing.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.100
This is all your doing.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.230
You should at least give me
some compensation.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.710
I have no money.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.190
I'll ask your boyfriend.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:02.390
You can't.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.340
Okay.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.660
I won't go to him.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.500
I also know

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.920
you need to pay for
Mengmeng's illness.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.740
I'm not asking for much.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.740
Fifty thousand.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.870
Ten days.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.950
If I can't get it after ten days,

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.990
I will send it to

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.470
Lyu Danshun.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.580
Right?

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.340
I'll be waiting.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.300
He asked for it more than once, huh?

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.780
After he was released from prison,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.780
he completely lost that

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.390
superior attitude he had before.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.190
No more acting.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.820
Just a total scumbag.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.630
Every time he asks for money,
he says it's the last time.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.950
With that last video,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.870
he kept squeezing close to

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.430
100 grand out of me,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.870
half threatening, half swearing.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.100
Holding so many videos in his hand.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.670
When you were with him,

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.950
if you ever disobeyed him,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.150
he could use the videos to control you.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.500
Now that he sees you've moved on.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.230
So he uses these videos to threaten you

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.020
to get what he wants.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.630
Last week,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.340
he asked me for thirty thousand again.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.740
I really have no money left for him.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.190
Let him do whatever.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:00.870
I have it.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.070
I'll give it to him.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.020
But on one condition.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.100
You help me get him to come out.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.270
What do you want to do, Hong?

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.350
Nothing.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.350
Just eliminate a scumbag
for the greater good.

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.950
No, no.

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.350
You have a case hanging over you.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.750
- It's too dangerous.
- Dangerous?

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.100
Me, a murderer, dangerous?

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.540
Or a fraudster dangerous?

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140
Don't worry.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140
If he meets me,

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.140
he's the one in danger.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.220
I'll handle this scoundrel for you.

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.580
We're even.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.140
If you help me like this,

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.500
I don't know how to repay you.

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:50.950
Actually,

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.060
you have a way to repay.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.990
Do me a favor.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.270
My mom lives in a nursing home.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.700
Send her some money

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.540
in your name.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.220
I want my mom

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.310
to have a worry-free old age.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.950
Don't worry.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.990
You rest assured too.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.990
I'll deal with this scumbag.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.220
Only after dealing with him

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.140
can I leave with peace of mind.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:35.750
Come on.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.700
Give me Feiyu's phone number.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.350
It's Feichuan.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.100

you have to give me the phone too.

Fifty thousand buys the videos.

Wanna call the police?

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.020
I, Ma Weicheng,

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.310
asked Zhang Yan for fifty thousand yuan.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.540
But I deserve it.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.830
She had no one to love her as a kid.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.060
I was the one who saved her.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.140
I took her in

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.040
like a stray dog.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.100
But now she's turning on me.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.500
Go ahead, call the police.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.950
At most they'll arrest me again.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.310
A few more days inside.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.950
I've been there before.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.100
I'll come to you after I get out.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.310
You'll never get rid of me.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.500
- Hello.
- Hong.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.700
Try this password.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.100
18881124.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.140
But he found out I was recording.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.220
He's on his way back now.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.060
What?

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.980
(Local Disk)

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.060
(Mine)

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.620
(Delete)

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.380
(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.580
(Cut)

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.740
(Copying)

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.340
(Copying, 60 seconds remaining)

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.260
(Copying, 45 seconds remaining)

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.460

(Luxury Private Room)

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.060
(Power on)

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.500
Why did we come here?

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.700
I want to show you something.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.830
I don't want to look, just delete it.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.750
Every time I see Mengmeng,

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.660
I think of you with another man.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.870
The way you were together.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.790
This is really too cruel.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.540
Mengmeng.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:39.670
Look.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.500
Stop crying!

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.270
No crying allowed.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.950
Stop crying, do you hear me?

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.310
Stop crying!

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.620
Stop crying!

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.860
Stop crying!

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:07.470
Zhang Yan.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:12.620
Your child is just too noisy.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.270
I really can't get a minute of rest.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.870
It's really killing me.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.430
However,

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.180
I thought of a good idea.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.270
This idea

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.310
should help her fall asleep, right?

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.020
If this still doesn't work,

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.500
then I really have no other way.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.470
Does anyone in your family
take sleeping pills?

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.060
The Lab Test Results
came out.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.390
It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.240
- Her fever lasted so long
- Mengmeng.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.750
- that she got brain damage.
- Mengmeng.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.250
- It can lead
- Don't cry, milk time.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.180
- to developmental regression.
- Milk time.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.100
Hold it.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.870
Let go of me!

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.390
Let me go!

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.990
Let go of me!

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.580
Let me go!

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.420
Zhang Yan.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.540
Zhang Yan.
