THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:54.242
-Honey!
-Hi.

00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:55.952
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.005
Excuse me.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.592
Mr. Kim Nak-su?

00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:40.956
Should I get a refill?

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:43.875
-No, thanks.
-Okay.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.253
Shall we start talking?

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:48.755
Sure, let's talk.

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:54.177
Which company do you--

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.221
You know I work for a credit card company.

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:59.266
Right. A credit card company.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.226
Then what school did you--

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:03.103
Just a junior college.

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:04.312
-Next.
-Next.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.065
Then…

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.153
-Par--
-My parents?

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.029
No.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:14.948
Don't you want to know anything about me?

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:16.491
Of course I do.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.452
I really do, but…

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:21.997
I…

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.585
I need to use the restroom for a second.

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:28.879
Excuse me.

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:40.015
Damn you, Loafer.
I didn't know that, did I?

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:44.728
I thought I'd be able to talk smoothly,
like I did at job interviews.

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.980
Stop with the nagging.
Do you have any tips?

00:02:48.607 --> 00:02:49.483
Zodiac sign?

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:51.860
I don't know anything about that stuff.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.621
I HOPE YOU MEET SOMEONE NICE

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:19.012
BUS STOP

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:07.060
First of all, I apologize.

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:08.186
I'm sorry.

00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:11.147
It's Sunday today.

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:12.941
The one day we get to rest.

00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:14.484
Cut to the chase.

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:15.902
Right.

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:19.948
What good does it do to you
to just leave after an hour?

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.659
Considering all the time
and energy you spent preparing for this,

00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:25.078
it would be a huge loss for you.

00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:26.037
A loss?

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.122
Yes.

00:04:27.747 --> 00:04:32.252
If I were you, I'd at least treat it
as practice for the next blind date

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:33.712
and sit through it.

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:35.463
Since you came out on the weekend,

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:37.924
you should at least
get something out of it.

00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:42.053
We weren't done with the fries,
but you cleared the table.

00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:43.555
I finished them.

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:45.849
How greedy of you.

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.267
DEBIT CARD RECEIPT

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.978
Even college students
have credit cards these days.

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:50.937
How come you don't?

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:52.814
I…

00:04:53.565 --> 00:04:55.650
I really am getting a free bike, right?

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:58.320
Jeez, what would I gain from scamming you?

00:04:58.403 --> 00:04:59.696
Can I really use

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.282
the landline and the internet
at the same time with this?

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:03.241
Of course.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.076
-Do you play Fortress?
-Yes.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.495
You don't have to
go to internet cafes now.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.956
Once you install this,
Fortress runs great at home.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.291
-Really?
-Yes.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:13.793
I'm done.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:16.087
-Me too. Thank you.
-Okay.

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:19.090
This month's sales competition is no joke.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.176
I was sweating bullets.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.514
See? Good thing you didn't go home, right?

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.392
Well, I did get something out of this.

00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:33.229
Why didn't you talk like this before?

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:37.525
It's been a month
since I joined the company,

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:42.322
and this is actually my first time
meeting people outside of work.

00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:45.158
My gosh. You must work overtime every day.

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.576
Yes.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.828
-Here's your pen.
-Okay.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:03.259
Do you enjoy your work?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.180
Not really.

00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:09.766
Then why not have some fun
instead of overworking yourself?

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.601
Otherwise, what's the point of living?

00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:12.811
What do you mean?

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:16.731
I need to get promoted, buy a house,
and get married. I should work hard.

00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:18.358
When you get married,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.778
are you going to take it easy at work?

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:30.537
You are so beautiful.

00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:34.332
Come on now.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.377
Are you trying to get me
to buy something else?

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:54.227
What's so great, Dad?

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.479
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:59.315
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.375
Where are you going?

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:24.257
I'm going to sleep somewhere else tonight.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.675
Why?

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.809
Because I think it's only fair.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:38.938
I know Dad isn't coming home
because of me.

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:43.318
I'll call him tomorrow and apologize.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:46.488
I can at least do that much for him.

00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:49.949
I won't mean it, though.

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:53.119
Good night.

00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:55.455
Su-gyeom.

00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.336
On your way out,

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:03.755
please throw away the boxes
by the front door.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:11.471
Is there anything else?

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:15.767
And…

00:08:19.062 --> 00:08:21.231
go buy me one more of these, please.

00:08:25.568 --> 00:08:26.778
Come on.

00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:37.580
Do you know

00:08:37.664 --> 00:08:39.749
how I feel

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:42.502
after giving your dad an earful?

00:08:44.963 --> 00:08:46.589
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

00:08:46.673 --> 00:08:50.510
Your dad is absolutely
in the wrong from start to finish.

00:08:50.593 --> 00:08:51.761
And yet,

00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:54.430
after 10 or 20 minutes,

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:57.892
I'm the one who feels worse.

00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:04.315
He always manages to make me apologize,
even when I don't mean it.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.153
"Okay, honey. I'm sorry."

00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:10.905
"I think I was wrong."

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.837
I'm sorry, son.

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:27.672
I've really

00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:30.800
spoiled your dad.

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:35.555
You sure have.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.640
Why did you do that?

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:42.312
I don't know.

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:46.357
I guess

00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:51.821
I wanted our home to be the one place
where your father wouldn't feel small.

00:09:55.533 --> 00:09:58.077
Also, think about
your dad's face, you know?

00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:00.997
When his eyebrows droop like that
and he's all sulky,

00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:04.834
he looks so pitiful.

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:09.130
So,

00:10:09.214 --> 00:10:12.258
are you giving up on
the real estate license exam too?

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:25.813
I should just mop the floor myself.

00:10:25.897 --> 00:10:29.609
What luxury was I hoping for, really?

00:10:29.692 --> 00:10:33.196
Goodness, why's this thing
acting up again?

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:36.532
Don't be like me.

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:39.244
You do what you want.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.163
It's okay for children to do that.

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.792
You're allowed to do that, Su-gyeom.

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:56.636
EPISODE 3
MVP

00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:57.762
I've been using

00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:59.097
ACT's fastest

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.141
and most expensive Super Giga
Internet Plan for the past two years.

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:03.101
But its actual speed

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:06.521
wasn't even a hundredth
of the speed I'm supposed to get.

00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:09.524
I'm sure many other users have experienced

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:11.401
the same issue, not just me.

00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:15.238
Until ACT gives a reasonable response,

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.240
I'll make sure to get
to the bottom of this.

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:18.324
HEAD OF SALES
HWANG TAE-SAN

00:11:18.408 --> 00:11:20.451
This has been your IT-BOY.

00:11:20.535 --> 00:11:21.869
IT-BOY WILL GO ALL THE WAY

00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:23.288
Turn on the lights.

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.052
Is he well-known?

00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:40.680
EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT
YOUTUBER'S EXPOSÉ ON ACT'S INTERNET SPEEDS

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:42.682
-He has over two million subscribers.
-My gosh.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:44.809
How many articles have been published?

00:11:44.892 --> 00:11:46.644
Two online outlets have covered it so far,

00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:49.647
but it hasn't hit the main pages
on the web portals yet.

00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:52.775
Isn't this an issue
for the Infrastructure Team and not us?

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.777
That's true for the YouTuber case,

00:11:54.861 --> 00:11:57.447
but our sales division also needs
a full investigation.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.615
If there were any instances
of us proposing contracts

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:01.451
knowing there was no Giga coverage,

00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:04.078
we could be sued
for illegal business practices.

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:10.084
The quote was based on Super Giga,
but this area isn't covered yet.

00:12:10.168 --> 00:12:11.252
SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST 2025

00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:13.629
Get it installed.
It's just a few months at most.

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:18.801
It just made it to the main page.

00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:23.514
ACT SLAMMED FOR "FASTEST SPEED" CLAIM

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.149
Okay, everyone.

00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:36.903
This was supposed to be my day off,
but I came in because of this.

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.237
But seeing the state of things,

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.866
it doesn't seem like something
that requires my presence.

00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:45.995
So, I'd like for you to follow
Mr. Baek's orders

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.664
and respond to this issue proactively.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.043
-But, Mr. Hwang--
-Please take a seat.

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.879
All right, then. Have a good day.

00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:05.473
Who's taking the meeting notes right now?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.309
I am, sir.

00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:11.896
I don't think there's any need
to include my name in the attendees list,

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:12.939
don't you think?

00:13:13.022 --> 00:13:15.316
I was only here for ten minutes.

00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:18.111
Understood, sir.

00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:20.321
Have a good day.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.040
Let's take ten.

00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:49.267
Mr. Kim.

00:13:50.184 --> 00:13:51.310
What is it? Let's talk later.

00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:53.146
-I need to go.
-Just one minute, sir.

00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:54.480
What is it?

00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:59.610
To be honest,
I recorded our conversation that day.

00:14:00.153 --> 00:14:01.028
What?

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:03.489
I recorded it when I told you
about the Yangpyeong case.

00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:06.993
It is a bit ambiguous,
so I'd like for you to take a look.

00:14:09.537 --> 00:14:12.331
You scary bastard.
Why would you record that?

00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:14.500
I always do it when I report something.
Just in case.

00:14:14.584 --> 00:14:17.378
-I have to watch my back.
-Wow, you're unbelievable.

00:14:18.963 --> 00:14:20.923
But that's not what's important.

00:14:21.007 --> 00:14:24.177
Before the meeting,
I listened to the recording again,

00:14:25.178 --> 00:14:27.680
and Mr. Baek was there
with us at the time, right?

00:14:28.431 --> 00:14:29.307
Listen to this.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.349
ACT HEADQUARTERS 10

00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:32.810
Yes, but we have to start
the service next week.

00:14:32.894 --> 00:14:34.812
What? Is there a problem?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.732
No, sir.

00:14:39.484 --> 00:14:41.194
What's there to worry about?

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.114
What are you saying?

00:14:46.616 --> 00:14:50.369
So, if Mr. Baek decides
to make an issue of this,

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:53.998
shouldn't he also bear
part of the responsibility?

00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:01.631
Yes, Mr. Baek. I'll be right there.

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:06.010
Delete that, you punk.

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:11.140
You little…

00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:12.767
-Delete it.
-Okay.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.851
-Jeez.
-Okay.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.858
Why would I?

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.071
Jeong-tae.

00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:27.657
Come on. Lighten up.

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:30.493
You know Hwang Tae-san's
survived three years

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:31.953
just by knowing when to back out.

00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:34.539
Gosh, that little weasel.

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.085
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:40.294
The nails that stick out

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:43.172
get hammered down
during performance review season.

00:15:43.256 --> 00:15:46.300
So it's a bit risky for me
to make any big moves right now.

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:50.721
If Hwang Tae-san tells me to crawl,
I have to crawl.

00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:53.766
Every time I see him,
he asks me why I played golf

00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:56.519
with the directors last time.
It's driving me crazy.

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:03.943
Nak-su.

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:08.030
You don't have anything

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:10.866
they can hold against you, do you?

00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:16.205
No, I'm good.

00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:17.206
Then…

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.377
can you take the lead
and try to sort it out?

00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:24.297
Me?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.717
This could actually be
an opportunity for you.

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:29.802
Don't you think so?

00:16:30.344 --> 00:16:32.138
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.

00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:38.311
You can't do it?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.273
I can. It's a good opportunity.

00:16:42.356 --> 00:16:43.232
Understood.

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:46.402
Let's make it work.

00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:13.220
Yes.

00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:14.180
Goodbye, sir.

00:17:14.263 --> 00:17:16.223
Hello.

00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:17.183
Hi.

00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:23.314
How's that going?

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:24.815
What?

00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:27.943
How's what going?

00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:31.489
The bomb that dropped today.

00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:35.534
I heard some YouTuber totally lost it
over the slow internet speed.

00:17:35.618 --> 00:17:37.662
Oh, that one?

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:39.789
It's nothing serious.

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:42.833
It seems pretty serious.
I even saw an article on it online.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.712
No, it's not a big deal.

00:17:47.338 --> 00:17:48.756
Our very own…

00:17:49.632 --> 00:17:50.716
Nak-su…

00:17:51.342 --> 00:17:53.135
will handle it without a problem.

00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:54.095
I will.

00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:56.514
I see.

00:17:57.056 --> 00:17:59.558
After all, you do have
25 years of experience.

00:18:00.643 --> 00:18:03.187
Show us what you got.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.233
Show us what you got.
Show us what you got.

00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.320
I will show you.

00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:13.322
I didn't mean to tease you.

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:18.494
Mr. Baek.

00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:27.670
Don't you think they're going to try
to pin the blame on the subcontractors?

00:18:28.546 --> 00:18:30.005
-Jeez.
-You think so?

00:18:30.923 --> 00:18:32.591
That will just make people more upset.

00:18:32.675 --> 00:18:35.386
And yet, that's the kind of choice

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.431
our company always makes.

00:18:56.115 --> 00:18:57.283
I should sit there.

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:05.374
As per Mr. Baek's direction,

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:08.377
I'll be taking charge of this case.

00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:11.130
So, let's hear
what everyone thinks, shall we?

00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:13.632
-Go on.
-As I mentioned earlier,

00:19:13.716 --> 00:19:17.219
the issue is recommending Giga Internet

00:19:17.303 --> 00:19:19.388
in areas where it's not available.

00:19:19.472 --> 00:19:21.724
But my team has not made
such recommendations,

00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:24.477
and we haven't had
any customer complaints about it either.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:28.814
But if Team 1 has in fact done that,

00:19:28.898 --> 00:19:31.442
then we'll step in
and help out as much as we can

00:19:31.525 --> 00:19:32.610
to get it sorted--

00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:34.987
Sorry to cut you off, Jin-woo.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.491
I appreciate your concern for my team.

00:19:38.574 --> 00:19:41.368
But we're still figuring out
the exact situation,

00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:45.414
so let's save the hypotheticals for now
rather than rushing in, shall we?

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:47.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:48.709
Anyone else?

00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:51.712
Anyone from my team?

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.757
For now,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.220
maybe we should pass this
over to the Infrastructure Team.

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:03.224
The most important thing right now
is a fast response,

00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:04.809
-and also--
-I don't think

00:20:04.892 --> 00:20:07.770
we can solve this that way.

00:20:31.085 --> 00:20:32.837
Let's not make things difficult.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.631
Let's focus on the core issue here.

00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:39.927
A famous YouTuber said he was paying
top money for the best internet plan

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.973
from Korea's best telecom company,

00:20:44.056 --> 00:20:46.559
only to go, "The service was terrible

00:20:46.642 --> 00:20:48.811
and not worth what I paid."
So he called us out.

00:20:48.894 --> 00:20:50.729
-Yes.
-I've said it again and again.

00:20:50.813 --> 00:20:54.191
A direct approach is necessary
in situations like this.

00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:56.694
Be open and honest.

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:58.112
You're right, Mr. Kim.

00:20:58.195 --> 00:20:59.405
The simplest way is

00:20:59.488 --> 00:21:01.866
to just admit what happened
and deal with it by the book.

00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:02.908
Song-hee.

00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:05.035
Yes, Mr. Kim.

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.371
Get in touch with the YouTuber
and tell him

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.874
to take down all the videos.

00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:15.087
Go on.

00:21:15.754 --> 00:21:17.715
All the videos. Okay.

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:20.801
All…

00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:22.219
A refund?

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:23.846
Yes.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:25.431
GET A REAL ESTATE LICENSE IN A YEAR

00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:26.557
INTENSIVE COURSE INFO SHEET

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.641
Okay.

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:32.104
May I ask

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.523
why you want to get a refund?

00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:37.610
I gave it some thought, and--

00:21:37.693 --> 00:21:39.612
Don't lose your confidence.

00:21:39.695 --> 00:21:42.656
It's the kind of exam
even grandmas can pass.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.034
It's not that I'm not confident--

00:21:45.117 --> 00:21:48.245
The one or two million won tuition fee
is not what's important.

00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:52.207
You're shaping your next 50 years,
the second phase of your life.

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:54.501
Let me explain.

00:21:54.585 --> 00:21:55.920
It's not about money.

00:21:56.003 --> 00:21:58.923
-Look at them. Tell her.
-They started with no prior knowledge.

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:00.799
And they passed in just six months.

00:22:00.883 --> 00:22:02.051
FASTEST EXAM PASSERS

00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:05.179
If you pass both exams in one go,
we offer a scholarship.

00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:07.848
Look over there. "The 2024 Hall of Fame."

00:22:07.932 --> 00:22:09.934
How wonderful is that?

00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:13.103
No wonder so many students
enroll at this academy.

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:14.813
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.900
Let me speak.

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:33.707
What?

00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.709
You're out. Where are you?

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.920
Jongno. On my way back home.

00:22:38.003 --> 00:22:40.130
You're nearby.
Do you want to come join us?

00:22:40.214 --> 00:22:42.341
-Have you eaten?
-What are you up to?

00:22:42.424 --> 00:22:45.511
We're having lunch at Namdaemun Park View.

00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:48.722
We can add one more person for free
with our membership.

00:22:48.806 --> 00:22:51.350
Don't bother.
Enjoy your date with your husband.

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:52.434
Come quickly.

00:22:52.518 --> 00:22:55.396
If not now,
when will you ever eat at a hotel?

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:59.108
I had dinner with your brother-in-law
at the Hyatt two years ago!

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:01.652
Okay. Good for you.

00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:02.695
Come quickly.

00:23:02.778 --> 00:23:04.863
Sang-cheol has something to tell you.

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:07.866
Why would your husband
have anything to say to me?

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.076
Lure her with the king crabs.

00:23:09.159 --> 00:23:10.285
-King crabs?
-Yes.

00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:12.997
The king crabs here are holy crabs.

00:23:13.747 --> 00:23:16.166
These king crabs are in-crab-ible!

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.377
-Come over!
-See you in a bit.

00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:22.548
I'll ask for support, and…

00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:24.842
That little punk is trying to play me?

00:23:27.594 --> 00:23:30.597
You're lucky you have
a team leader like me.

00:23:30.681 --> 00:23:32.975
If you take Do Jin-woo's bait
on a day like this,

00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:36.020
you'll end up dancing
to Team 2's tune forever.

00:23:36.103 --> 00:23:38.230
So, you really think

00:23:38.313 --> 00:23:41.275
a YouTuber with two million subscribers

00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:43.736
will just take the video down
because we asked?

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:45.446
You think I was born yesterday?

00:23:46.405 --> 00:23:47.364
Then?

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.451
We're going with a counterattack strategy.

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:52.536
Now's the time to go hard.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:55.539
Then he'll be like, "What's going on?"

00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:59.668
Then we can negotiate
from a more advantageous position.

00:23:59.752 --> 00:24:02.379
They don't make nuclear weapons
to actually use them.

00:24:04.006 --> 00:24:07.259
We really need to think carefully here.

00:24:07.342 --> 00:24:09.428
This might take away
any room left for negotiation.

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:10.929
What do you mean?

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:12.389
Instead of "What's going on?"

00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:16.060
he might go, "They want me to take
the videos down without even apologizing?"

00:24:16.143 --> 00:24:18.145
"Are they insane?"

00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:21.273
It might provoke him even more.

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:23.484
Those guys make a living
off ads and sponsorships.

00:24:23.567 --> 00:24:25.861
Would he go that far against
a major corporation like ours?

00:24:25.944 --> 00:24:27.446
That's the point.

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:28.739
"What the heck?"

00:24:28.822 --> 00:24:31.658
"A major corporation is abusing its power
against an influencer."

00:24:31.742 --> 00:24:33.494
He could very much react like that.

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:39.875
Song-hee,
you've been quiet this whole time.

00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.085
This concerns you too.

00:24:41.168 --> 00:24:42.086
Sorry?

00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:43.545
I'm asking what you think.

00:24:45.672 --> 00:24:46.548
What I think--

00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:48.967
What do you suggest we do?

00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:52.054
If it were up to me,

00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:56.183
I wouldn't have handled it like this.
Not in a million years.

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:03.107
Let's put the idea on hold for now. Then…

00:25:03.607 --> 00:25:06.193
But I've already sent the email.

00:25:13.158 --> 00:25:14.493
-Unsend it.
-Unsend?

00:25:29.133 --> 00:25:30.384
SENT MAIL

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:32.136
"IT-BOY" VIDEO DELETION REQUEST
SALES TEAM 1

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.471
READ RECEIPT

00:25:35.806 --> 00:25:36.765
STATUS: READ

00:25:40.936 --> 00:25:43.397
Why did you choose now,
of all times, to be efficient?

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:45.732
You guys too.

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:48.485
You should've stopped me at the meeting
if it was such a bad idea.

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:49.611
I'm sorry.

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:52.114
Seriously. You should've
tried harder to stop me.

00:25:52.197 --> 00:25:55.409
It's so hard to work with you guys.

00:25:56.577 --> 00:25:58.453
My gosh.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.958
Sung-gu.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.716
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.052
How did your call
with Yangpyeong go this morning?

00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:16.513
I begged and pleaded,

00:26:16.597 --> 00:26:19.141
so I think we can get away with it.

00:26:19.224 --> 00:26:20.225
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:21.393
Remember, we have…

00:26:24.563 --> 00:26:26.815
What do you expect me to do with it?

00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:28.275
Go away.

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:30.611
Jeez.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.324
Today's ACT incident
reminded me once again

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.619
of just how pathetic the mindset
of major Korean corporations really is.

00:26:38.702 --> 00:26:39.912
It's not surprising at all.

00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:41.330
So starting now, we--

00:26:52.341 --> 00:26:55.385
You guys even have a CEO's office.

00:26:56.428 --> 00:26:59.973
With our new Chief Destruction Officer
over there, Kim Su-gyeom,

00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:02.309
we'll thoroughly break
all conventional rules.

00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:04.019
Let's start with that.

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:06.104
Give him a round of applause.

00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:08.482
-Welcome.
-Su-geon.

00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:10.692
-It's Su-gyeom.
-I haven't made up my mind yet.

00:27:13.695 --> 00:27:16.782
I still can't quite tell
what kind of company this is,

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:20.661
so let me watch you work a bit
before I make a decision.

00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:28.252
Go on.

00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:34.424
Okay. If that's the case…

00:27:34.508 --> 00:27:35.968
What? Let go of me.

00:27:36.927 --> 00:27:37.844
Are you sure?

00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:42.808
Ta-da!

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:45.352
I'm a pro.

00:27:48.563 --> 00:27:52.234
I'll get some more of those king crabs
that my sister loves so much.

00:27:52.317 --> 00:27:53.568
Get the legs, will you?

00:27:53.652 --> 00:27:55.696
Plenty of legs. Got it.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.030
A lot of them, honey.

00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:07.249
So you see,

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:09.918
I'm planning to quit my job

00:28:10.002 --> 00:28:12.212
and fly solo.

00:28:12.296 --> 00:28:13.255
Fly solo?

00:28:13.338 --> 00:28:16.466
Not exactly solo.
There'll be about three of us as co-CEOs,

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.136
and we're planning
to try and get into fintech.

00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:21.888
She doesn't know all that jargon.
Dumb it down for her.

00:28:21.972 --> 00:28:23.348
-Dumb it down?
-Yes.

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:25.350
Anyway, go on.

00:28:25.434 --> 00:28:29.438
As you know, I've been
a software developer all my life,

00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:30.814
so I'm terrible at sales.

00:28:31.773 --> 00:28:32.691
He's a nerd.

00:28:33.317 --> 00:28:34.192
I see.

00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:36.361
If Nak-su, with 25 years…

00:28:36.445 --> 00:28:37.446
-Is it 25 years?
-Yes!

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:38.613
If Nak-su joins us,

00:28:38.697 --> 00:28:41.033
with his experience
at a major telecom company,

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:45.287
it would be like putting wings on a tiger.

00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:50.625
I actually have a few connections
over at ACT,

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:54.379
and I asked around to see
what kind of offer it would take

00:28:54.463 --> 00:28:56.757
to bring in someone
with Nak-su's level of experience.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.719
I'm used to developer salaries,
so when I looked, I was honestly like,

00:29:00.802 --> 00:29:01.762
"Huh?"

00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:05.015
It was lower than I expected.

00:29:09.394 --> 00:29:10.645
I'm sorry.

00:29:10.729 --> 00:29:14.191
That came out wrong.
That's not what I meant.

00:29:14.274 --> 00:29:15.817
Anyway, I believe I can make him

00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.111
a better offer than what he currently has.

00:29:19.404 --> 00:29:20.447
Right.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.282
He's basically saying

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:26.328
he can give Nak-su a bigger salary.

00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:28.038
I understand that perfectly.

00:29:28.914 --> 00:29:31.291
Can you casually ask him

00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:34.503
if he has a plan B
in case there's any issue

00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:36.880
with his executive promotion this year?

00:29:36.963 --> 00:29:38.840
ACT has a bit of a reputation

00:29:38.924 --> 00:29:41.718
for not being flexible in how it operates.

00:29:41.802 --> 00:29:45.263
Honestly, I think his talent
is kind of wasted at ACT.

00:29:45.347 --> 00:29:46.890
Just look at what happened today.

00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:49.893
You saw how ACT handles issues that arise.

00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.228
Goodness gracious.

00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:53.271
You saw it too, didn't you?

00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:55.524
In what world
is that a reasonable response?

00:29:55.607 --> 00:29:57.275
That was pathetic.

00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:00.278
How can they handle it like that
in this day and age?

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:03.448
Didn't you say you were friends
with that YouTuber?

00:30:03.532 --> 00:30:06.952
We're not super close.
He's an acquaintance.

00:30:07.035 --> 00:30:08.328
-An acquaintance?
-Yes.

00:30:08.412 --> 00:30:09.454
What's going on?

00:30:09.538 --> 00:30:11.957
Did something happen
at my husband's company?

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.083
You don't know?

00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:15.752
I actually got an email
from ACT's Sales Team 1,

00:30:15.836 --> 00:30:17.337
asking me to take the video down.

00:30:17.421 --> 00:30:18.964
Why should I take down my video?

00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:20.799
Why should I? Why?

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:21.925
Gloves are off.

00:30:22.008 --> 00:30:24.094
I'll put everything I've got
as IT-BOY on the line

00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:25.971
and see this through to the end.

00:30:26.054 --> 00:30:28.557
And I just got a report

00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:32.310
about a public facility
in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province.

00:30:32.394 --> 00:30:35.105
Whether intentionally or not,
ACT went ahead

00:30:35.188 --> 00:30:38.191
and forced the completion of construction,

00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:41.486
even though Super Giga Internet service
isn't available in the area.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.447
That's corporate abuse.

00:30:44.072 --> 00:30:47.451
If you've been affected by this,
let me know.

00:30:47.534 --> 00:30:49.244
I'll step up and handle it.

00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:51.371
This has been IT-BOY.

00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:54.166
Support me by liking,
subscribing, and enabling notifications.

00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:55.625
LEGAL TEAM LEADER
HAM HYEON-GYEONG

00:30:55.709 --> 00:30:57.335
Are there any other links up yet?

00:30:57.419 --> 00:30:59.796
You can assume most of them
have already been posted.

00:31:08.346 --> 00:31:12.559
2ND EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT
YOUTUBER'S EXPOSÉ ON ACT'S INTERNET SPEEDS

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:13.727
How many views so far?

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.354
The first video has surpassed
two million views,

00:31:16.438 --> 00:31:18.190
and the second one,
uploaded just recently,

00:31:18.273 --> 00:31:20.150
has surpassed five hundred thousand.

00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:21.776
It's all over social media,

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.070
and even the office worker forums
are buzzing.

00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:25.238
ACT VIDEO TAKEDOWN REQUEST

00:31:25.322 --> 00:31:28.074
It seems like our request
to have the video taken down

00:31:28.158 --> 00:31:29.659
is becoming quite an issue.

00:31:34.498 --> 00:31:35.874
Kim Nak-su.

00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.960
-Yes, sir.
-Did you really think

00:31:39.044 --> 00:31:42.005
he'd just say, "Yes, sir,"
and take it down?

00:31:43.215 --> 00:31:45.842
Don't you have any empathy?

00:31:45.926 --> 00:31:49.971
I didn't exactly order my team
to make him take it down.

00:31:50.055 --> 00:31:52.641
I just floated the idea
that we could try--

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.103
What's done is done.

00:31:57.187 --> 00:31:59.898
Let's post a corrective order notice
on our website now

00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:01.608
and a separate apology statement.

00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:03.485
Even if we end up paying a fine,

00:32:03.568 --> 00:32:05.946
we need to respond quickly from now on

00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:07.697
to minimize the damage to our image.

00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:08.823
I agree.

00:32:08.907 --> 00:32:11.451
We'll take care of that
on our side right away.

00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:14.621
-Okay.
-I need to check something.

00:32:14.704 --> 00:32:19.000
Where's the public facility in Yangpyeong
that was mentioned in the recent video?

00:32:19.084 --> 00:32:20.794
Who's in charge of that?

00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:26.967
You need to be honest about
whether this was intentional or a mistake.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.052
We need to know in order to respond.

00:32:29.135 --> 00:32:30.595
If we get an administrative sanction,

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:33.932
worst case, we could have
our business suspended

00:32:34.015 --> 00:32:35.684
or even be barred from public bidding.

00:32:37.018 --> 00:32:38.853
We'll easily lose tens of billions.

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:42.440
One person's idea
turned into an official company order.

00:32:42.524 --> 00:32:44.568
We must investigate
and compensate properly.

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:47.237
Okay. I'll get to the bottom of this.

00:32:52.867 --> 00:32:54.828
Do I need to tell you right now?

00:32:56.997 --> 00:32:57.872
No.

00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:01.251
You can tell us
when you're ready, Mr. Baek.

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:07.924
We'll discuss it
within the sales division first.

00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:26.568
-Team 2.
-We were not in charge of this.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.612
You're excused.

00:33:32.616 --> 00:33:34.784
-Good work in there, Mr. Do.
-Thanks.

00:33:34.868 --> 00:33:36.703
Myung-heon and So-yeon, keep an eye on it.

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:37.954
Yes, sir.

00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:39.289
Was it you guys?

00:33:40.624 --> 00:33:42.250
Of course it was you guys.

00:33:42.334 --> 00:33:43.293
Where is it?

00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:48.757
Shall I tell him?

00:33:52.344 --> 00:33:54.262
It's Yangpyeong Dream Cultural Center.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.223
The Giga Internet
will be installed in August,

00:33:57.307 --> 00:33:59.267
but we signed the contract
without any prior noti--

00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:01.019
My gosh.

00:34:03.438 --> 00:34:04.314
Kim Nak-su.

00:34:05.607 --> 00:34:07.525
What on earth were you thinking?

00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:12.739
I'm asking what you were thinking
when you did that!

00:34:17.911 --> 00:34:19.120
I apologize.

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:21.498
Leave me with Nak-su.

00:34:28.505 --> 00:34:30.757
What the hell were you thinking?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.718
What goes on in that head of yours?
You really--

00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:40.767
Let's do what we can.

00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:49.150
Nak-su.

00:34:50.068 --> 00:34:50.944
Yes.

00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:54.656
We've been stuck in this company
for over 20 years.

00:34:55.407 --> 00:34:57.242
At this point, it's safe to say

00:34:58.368 --> 00:35:00.954
no one here actually likes us.

00:35:02.414 --> 00:35:05.750
The higher-ups hate us for not quitting.

00:35:05.834 --> 00:35:09.212
Our subordinates hate us
and wonder why we haven't been fired.

00:35:10.088 --> 00:35:11.798
You need to know

00:35:11.881 --> 00:35:15.135
what you can actually do
from where you stand.

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:18.722
If you can't handle it yourself,
the company won't handle it for you.

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:20.640
They won't wait for you!

00:35:23.476 --> 00:35:24.894
Do you feel wronged?

00:35:25.603 --> 00:35:26.646
No.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.274
If you can't handle it,
just tell me already.

00:35:29.357 --> 00:35:30.567
What's it going to be?

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:34.779
Just say it. If you can't handle it,

00:35:34.863 --> 00:35:38.408
I'll tell Do Jin-woo to do it,
whether it's the YouTuber or Yangpyeong.

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:41.661
I'll take care of it, sir.

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:47.083
Nak-su.

00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:49.127
Yes.

00:35:54.799 --> 00:35:56.551
You really are running out of time.

00:35:57.177 --> 00:35:58.470
You have to change.

00:35:59.554 --> 00:36:01.681
You have to take responsibility

00:36:02.849 --> 00:36:04.768
for all the choices you made.

00:36:19.324 --> 00:36:20.200
Okay.

00:36:26.414 --> 00:36:27.582
Yes.

00:36:27.665 --> 00:36:29.918
I'll connect you
to the Technical Support Team right away.

00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:31.419
SCAMMED BY ACT FOR TWO YEARS

00:36:31.503 --> 00:36:32.837
Wow. Over three million views.

00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:34.047
3.01 MILLION VIEWS

00:36:35.632 --> 00:36:38.051
Are you actually laughing now?

00:36:38.843 --> 00:36:41.554
A person with real class laughs
through the hard times.

00:36:44.516 --> 00:36:45.809
The Yangpyeong case…

00:36:45.892 --> 00:36:48.937
If what the Legal Team said is true,
this is a major incident.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.105
I won't get dragged into it, will I?

00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:54.442
Here he comes.

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:04.369
For you, sir.

00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:13.503
-Ik-hyeon.
-Yes, sir.

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:14.963
Let's step outside for a moment.

00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:18.007
Shall I join you?

00:37:40.238 --> 00:37:41.114
Mr. Kim,

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:43.825
let's work with Team 2 for now.

00:37:45.743 --> 00:37:49.747
We don't have time to deal with both
the YouTuber and Yangpyeong right now.

00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:51.583
Let Team 2 handle the YouTuber,

00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:54.002
and we'll head to Yangpyeong right now

00:37:54.502 --> 00:37:55.962
and beg for forgiveness.

00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:59.424
We'll tell them

00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:01.676
we'll waive next year's fees.

00:38:02.677 --> 00:38:06.014
I'll talk to the Customer Support Team.
They'll make it happen.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:13.229
If you feel uncomfortable asking
Do Jin-woo about the YouTuber, I'll do it.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.358
It's not that I feel uncomfortable
about it.

00:38:18.526 --> 00:38:20.695
Can't we handle the YouTuber case

00:38:21.362 --> 00:38:23.239
and let Do handle the Yangpyeong case?

00:38:24.032 --> 00:38:24.949
Why?

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:26.784
What do you mean, why?

00:38:26.868 --> 00:38:28.786
The Yangpyeong case
is clearly our responsibility.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.122
Why would we make Team 2 clean it up?

00:38:31.205 --> 00:38:33.249
Do Jin-woo's close with the Tech Team.

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:34.709
I even saw him earlier

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:36.502
-talking with Jun-seop--
-We can't do that.

00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:38.504
Right?

00:38:38.588 --> 00:38:40.340
-I guess we can't.
-No, sir.

00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:44.385
You really think so?

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.305
Do Jin-woo might actually prefer that.

00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:48.264
Even if…

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.350
even if that were the case,

00:38:51.017 --> 00:38:53.061
we need to clean up our own mess.

00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:55.939
-Right?
-It's the right thing to do.

00:38:56.022 --> 00:38:57.607
Yes, I know.

00:38:58.566 --> 00:39:00.485
But…

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:04.697
All eyes in the company
are on us right now.

00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:08.409
The Yangpyeong incident
is just a minor mix-up with the client.

00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:10.328
Right now,
whoever fixes this YouTuber mess

00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:12.288
becomes the MVP.

00:39:12.372 --> 00:39:14.499
Ik-hyeon, you don't understand.

00:39:14.582 --> 00:39:18.670
I can't afford to take it slow
and go step by step right now.

00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:21.714
I need to show off tangible results.
That's the position I'm in.

00:39:22.465 --> 00:39:24.300
You don't know the half of it.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.136
What?

00:39:27.887 --> 00:39:28.972
What is it?

00:39:30.306 --> 00:39:32.392
Come on. You know this is how I am.

00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:34.519
You've known me for over a decade.
You know me.

00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:35.979
-You--
-Mr. Kim.

00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:41.567
Fine. Don't look at me like that.

00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:43.528
Okay. Let's go.

00:39:44.529 --> 00:39:45.613
You think

00:39:46.447 --> 00:39:48.199
we shouldn't handle
the YouTuber case, right?

00:39:48.282 --> 00:39:49.325
We shouldn't.

00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:51.703
-Are you sure?
-Definitely.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.539
-Wouldn't Jin-woo prefer that?
-We can't, sir.

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:12.784
The weather's really nice.

00:41:19.207 --> 00:41:20.917
Have you sorted out your thoughts?

00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:28.466
I'm sorry. I'm getting more confused.

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.843
Still?

00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:34.847
I don't want to live like my dad.

00:41:34.931 --> 00:41:36.682
That's for sure.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.105
Do you honestly think
I'm a good fit for this company?

00:41:44.357 --> 00:41:45.233
You're not.

00:41:47.819 --> 00:41:49.445
Then why did you recommend me?

00:41:50.696 --> 00:41:52.448
Do you remember back in middle school?

00:41:54.575 --> 00:41:55.576
Middle school?

00:41:56.452 --> 00:41:58.412
Back in eighth grade,

00:41:58.913 --> 00:42:00.998
they took my earrings
during a random bag search.

00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:04.210
You were the class president.

00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:06.838
After it was over,
you went to the teacher's office and said,

00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:10.842
"Han-na wasn't wearing them.
She just had them in her bag."

00:42:10.925 --> 00:42:14.095
"Confiscating them seems a bit harsh."

00:42:14.762 --> 00:42:16.389
And you got them back for me.

00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:17.348
I did?

00:42:19.016 --> 00:42:22.979
Do you remember what you said to me
as you were handing me back my earrings?

00:42:23.938 --> 00:42:26.816
You told me not to bring
stuff like that to school,

00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:30.695
saying it would be my loss
if I got a bad school record.

00:42:30.778 --> 00:42:32.947
That's the Kim Su-gyeom I remember.

00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:36.159
A kid with a peculiar rebellious streak

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:38.953
and a stubborn, by-the-book nature.

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:46.377
I knew it. I don't belong here.

00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:49.672
I recommended you because you don't.

00:42:50.298 --> 00:42:54.385
Your by-the-book nature
could help keep us grounded.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.599
Thanks to you, I ended up
with a clean school record back then.

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:11.986
We'll go to Yangpyeong
and handle it ourselves.

00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:15.865
As for the YouTuber case, I think
it's better to explain face-to-face.

00:43:15.948 --> 00:43:17.909
I already asked the Tech Team for support.

00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:20.620
I've prepared all the tech materials,

00:43:20.703 --> 00:43:22.830
and we'll tidy it up
with the PR Team later.

00:43:22.914 --> 00:43:25.458
-Mr. Kim, I have the car ready.
-Sure. Let's do that.

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:27.752
If you're ready,
we can head to Yangpyeong now.

00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:28.920
Okay.

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:33.007
Song-hee.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.551
What are you doing?
You're coming with us, right?

00:43:36.844 --> 00:43:37.762
Me?

00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:43.351
-Of course, I should.
-Okay.

00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:46.938
It's better if several of us
apologize together.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:48.814
Okay.

00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:53.194
Once we're done, I know a restaurant
that does great griddle jjajang.

00:43:53.277 --> 00:43:54.737
It'll be my treat.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.156
That sounds delicious.

00:43:59.533 --> 00:44:02.578
We'll be heading out first, Mr. Kim.

00:44:02.662 --> 00:44:04.330
Okay.

00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:07.250
I'll bring Jun-seop
and a member of the Tech Team with me.

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:08.834
We'll keep you posted.

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:11.879
Are you going to the YouTuber's house?

00:44:11.963 --> 00:44:14.507
No, we're meeting
his agency's CEO first for now.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.718
The YouTuber seems reluctant
to meet us himself.

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:20.554
Okay. Good luck.

00:44:20.638 --> 00:44:22.598
I'll make sure to take care of it.

00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:26.727
Thank you.

00:44:28.813 --> 00:44:30.106
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:33.150
There's heavy traffic, so it'll take
about an hour and 40 minutes.

00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:35.361
-We should hurry.
-Okay. Jeez.

00:44:35.444 --> 00:44:37.238
Let's go, Song-hee.

00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:38.698
Okay.

00:44:40.324 --> 00:44:41.325
Hello.

00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:42.493
Hello, it's me.

00:44:43.703 --> 00:44:45.037
Who…

00:44:45.663 --> 00:44:46.664
It's me, Sang-cheol.

00:44:46.747 --> 00:44:48.666
Don't you have my number saved?

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:49.917
Sang-cheol…

00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:51.794
Oh, hi! What's going on?

00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:54.797
What?

00:44:58.968 --> 00:45:00.386
Hang on.

00:45:00.469 --> 00:45:02.305
Give me a second.

00:45:02.388 --> 00:45:05.349
-What? Yes.
-The YouTuber, the IT-BOY.

00:45:05.433 --> 00:45:06.767
He's an acquaintance of mine.

00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:07.893
Really?

00:45:07.977 --> 00:45:10.688
Yes, we've had drinks
together a few times.

00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:14.400
If it's all right with you, I'll organize
a meeting and arrange a time.

00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:16.610
Really? Can we do that today?

00:45:16.694 --> 00:45:19.322
Of course! He's my friend's best friend.

00:45:19.822 --> 00:45:21.449
Is that so?

00:45:21.532 --> 00:45:22.408
Yes.

00:45:22.491 --> 00:45:25.661
Honestly, this shouldn't have
escalated this far.

00:45:25.745 --> 00:45:28.497
I got frustrated just seeing
how things were unfolding.

00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:30.750
Tell me about it.

00:45:31.292 --> 00:45:34.295
That's why I contacted you.

00:45:34.378 --> 00:45:37.381
I thought maybe I could be
of some help to you.

00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:43.054
By the way, who was it?

00:45:43.137 --> 00:45:44.889
What kind of idiot

00:45:44.972 --> 00:45:47.266
tells a YouTuber to take their video down?

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.186
Just some idiot. A totally crazy idiot.

00:45:50.269 --> 00:45:52.313
Okay. Give me a minute.

00:45:52.396 --> 00:45:54.607
I'll get back to you right away.

00:46:00.279 --> 00:46:01.364
Thank you.

00:46:01.447 --> 00:46:03.783
Have some of this. Have some coffee.

00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:08.537
-Where did Jin-woo go?
-Sorry?

00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:09.830
Jin-woo.

00:46:09.914 --> 00:46:11.290
Which way did he go?

00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:12.792
-This way or that way?
-Over there.

00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.126
-There.
-This way?

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.253
Where are you going, Mr. Kim?

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:19.465
What's his deal now?

00:46:50.663 --> 00:46:51.705
Jin-woo!

00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:54.458
Wait!

00:46:56.669 --> 00:46:58.921
What's going on, Mr. Kim?

00:46:59.755 --> 00:47:00.631
I don't think

00:47:01.132 --> 00:47:03.342
we need to contact the agency.

00:47:04.009 --> 00:47:05.344
What do you mean?

00:47:05.428 --> 00:47:08.931
I've got a direct line to the YouTuber.

00:47:09.014 --> 00:47:12.309
I think I can meet him
one-on-one and sort this out.

00:47:12.393 --> 00:47:14.103
Great. If you give me his contact,

00:47:14.186 --> 00:47:16.105
-I'll reach out and handle--
-No.

00:47:16.188 --> 00:47:18.607
You don't need to trouble
yourself with that.

00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:20.860
My team will handle this matter. Okay?

00:47:20.943 --> 00:47:21.944
But we should--

00:47:22.027 --> 00:47:24.572
No, I feel bad as it is.
I know how busy you are.

00:47:24.655 --> 00:47:26.866
You really don't need
to concern yourself with this.

00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:27.867
We'll handle it.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:31.245
Since he's a tech YouTuber,

00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:33.289
the Tech Team should join
to explain the details.

00:47:33.372 --> 00:47:36.876
You can sum it up in a document
and give it to us.

00:47:36.959 --> 00:47:38.085
That will do.

00:47:38.169 --> 00:47:41.630
What's that? Is that the document?
Give it to me.

00:47:41.714 --> 00:47:43.966
Let me have that.

00:47:44.675 --> 00:47:46.969
I can read it
and explain it to him, right?

00:47:47.636 --> 00:47:49.680
Your resources are too valuable
to waste on this.

00:47:49.763 --> 00:47:51.807
Go rest up. What's that? A gift?

00:47:52.558 --> 00:47:53.726
Give me that.

00:47:54.768 --> 00:47:57.730
Head back in. We'll handle this.

00:47:58.355 --> 00:47:59.648
See you.

00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:02.735
Sorry?

00:48:02.818 --> 00:48:04.778
Mr. Kim? Hello?

00:48:05.404 --> 00:48:06.530
Was that Mr. Kim?

00:48:06.614 --> 00:48:08.157
-Yes.
-What did he say?

00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:13.370
He said to go on head
to Yangpyeong by ourselves.

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:17.291
-What the…
-I'll be monitoring it

00:48:17.374 --> 00:48:18.709
-in real time.
-Ik-hyeon.

00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:20.377
You got the news, right?

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:22.129
What is going on?

00:48:22.213 --> 00:48:24.340
Mr. Kim said he'll meet the YouTuber
and resolve this.

00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.799
It's better this way.

00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:27.551
I'm sorry.

00:48:27.635 --> 00:48:29.220
Please. You didn't do anything wrong.

00:48:30.262 --> 00:48:31.889
Keep up the good work.

00:48:31.972 --> 00:48:32.848
Good luck.

00:48:32.932 --> 00:48:34.892
Thank you.

00:48:40.564 --> 00:48:43.776
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I got it.

00:48:48.614 --> 00:48:50.407
Yes, I talked to him.

00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:52.910
I'll text you the address.
We'll meet you there.

00:48:52.993 --> 00:48:54.620
Don't worry about it.

00:48:55.287 --> 00:48:56.413
Take your time.

00:48:56.914 --> 00:48:58.999
Thank you so much.

00:48:59.083 --> 00:49:00.459
Please. No need to worry now.

00:49:00.543 --> 00:49:02.294
You came through big-time.

00:49:02.378 --> 00:49:04.296
I'll see you at home, Ha-yeong.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.881
-See you.
-Okay.

00:49:05.965 --> 00:49:06.924
Bye, Ha-jin.

00:49:07.007 --> 00:49:08.133
-Bye.
-I'll get going then.

00:49:08.217 --> 00:49:09.593
-Thank you.
-See you.

00:49:09.677 --> 00:49:10.719
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

00:49:13.013 --> 00:49:16.100
You really have
the best sister in the world.

00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:19.979
It would be great if your husband
could start working with Sang-cheol.

00:49:20.062 --> 00:49:23.399
In times like these,
family should stick together.

00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:26.277
That wasn't free lunch today.
I've given you a mission.

00:49:27.444 --> 00:49:30.698
I was so distracted earlier
that I didn't quite catch it.

00:49:30.781 --> 00:49:32.658
So what is it that Sang-cheol does?

00:49:34.743 --> 00:49:38.038
See? Even if we tell you,
you don't get it.

00:49:38.872 --> 00:49:40.624
It's fintech.

00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:43.335
Then elaborate on what it is for me

00:49:43.419 --> 00:49:45.254
and stop treating me like a fool.

00:49:50.426 --> 00:49:51.635
It's like…

00:49:52.261 --> 00:49:54.054
It's fintech.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.017
So what the heck is that? Jeez!

00:49:58.559 --> 00:49:59.727
He's so…

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.229
He's super annoying.

00:50:02.813 --> 00:50:03.897
Shall we play some music?

00:50:03.981 --> 00:50:04.857
Good idea.

00:50:06.358 --> 00:50:08.736
How can a person be this annoying?

00:50:08.819 --> 00:50:11.155
You think he's like this at home?
His wife must go crazy.

00:50:11.238 --> 00:50:14.074
Just listen to the music.

00:50:14.158 --> 00:50:15.868
Focus on the rhythm and the tempo.

00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:18.996
Let's pick up some refreshments
for the staff on our way there.

00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:20.497
We can't go empty-handed.

00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:21.582
Good idea.

00:50:21.665 --> 00:50:23.292
Am I the only one who's annoyed?

00:50:23.375 --> 00:50:25.461
-Hello?
-I'm always the only one who's annoyed!

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.964
-Hello, Nak-su.
-Hello.

00:50:29.048 --> 00:50:30.674
-How long has it been?
-How are you?

00:50:30.758 --> 00:50:31.967
-Here.
-For me?

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.429
This is the friend I told you about.

00:50:35.512 --> 00:50:36.972
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

00:50:37.056 --> 00:50:39.016
I'm Kim Nak-su from ACT Sales Team 1.

00:50:39.099 --> 00:50:40.225
It's nothing big, but…

00:50:40.768 --> 00:50:43.062
I won't ever forget the favor
you did for me.

00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:44.605
Oh, please.

00:50:44.688 --> 00:50:47.524
It'll be nice to see IT-BOY after so long.

00:50:47.608 --> 00:50:49.985
How is he? Has he calmed down a bit?

00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:51.695
I've buttered him up a bit.

00:50:51.779 --> 00:50:54.740
From what I saw,
it seemed like a simple technical issue.

00:50:54.823 --> 00:50:57.826
Exactly. It's just a simple issue.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:01.080
This would have been prevented
with better communication.

00:51:01.163 --> 00:51:02.706
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.542
I'll explain everything
and clear up any misunderstandings.

00:51:05.626 --> 00:51:07.670
-Okay. Let's go.
-Thank you so much.

00:51:07.753 --> 00:51:09.004
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:12.383
-How are things at ACT these days?
-We're barely scraping by.

00:51:12.466 --> 00:51:14.843
Come on. I know how competent you are.

00:51:14.927 --> 00:51:16.762
-Let me take that.
-It's fine. Let me.

00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:17.763
-I can…
-This way.

00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:22.726
This is Mr. Kim Nak-su,
a general manager at ACT.

00:51:26.897 --> 00:51:27.773
This is for you.

00:51:27.856 --> 00:51:30.526
-Goodness.
-You shouldn't have.

00:51:31.944 --> 00:51:33.153
I feel bad.

00:51:33.696 --> 00:51:36.615
The red areas indicate
completed Giga network construction,

00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:40.369
and the blue areas indicate
planned construction, as you can see.

00:51:40.452 --> 00:51:42.079
But if you look here…

00:51:42.162 --> 00:51:44.206
I can't believe a major Korean corporation

00:51:44.289 --> 00:51:47.835
would stoop so low to cheat
a small public facility!

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.837
-We are very sorry.
-We apologize

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.714
-We're sorry.
-Hold on.

00:51:51.797 --> 00:51:53.465
The person in charge didn't come?

00:51:55.384 --> 00:51:56.677
Regardless of the reason,

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.387
I once again express my deepest apologies.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.305
Okay.

00:52:00.389 --> 00:52:01.807
-All right.
-I mean it.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:03.058
Anyway,

00:52:03.142 --> 00:52:06.311
we're truly grateful to you, IT-BOY.

00:52:06.395 --> 00:52:09.857
You bringing this issue to light
keeps us on our toes

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.234
and pushes us to make our service better--

00:52:12.901 --> 00:52:14.194
-Gosh.
-Let me.

00:52:14.278 --> 00:52:15.946
-Let me.
-No, please. Here.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.823
Here.

00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:20.451
The person in charge should've come!

00:52:20.534 --> 00:52:22.119
What are you all doing here?

00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:23.454
Is this some joke?

00:52:23.537 --> 00:52:24.621
We're sorry.

00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:25.831
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

00:52:25.914 --> 00:52:28.542
By the way, whose idea was it
to have me take down the video?

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:30.210
It caught me off guard

00:52:30.294 --> 00:52:32.755
when I was told
to take the video down out of nowhere.

00:52:32.838 --> 00:52:36.508
The bastard who was dumb enough
to ask you to take it down…

00:52:37.217 --> 00:52:39.011
I mean, the employee…

00:52:39.094 --> 00:52:42.097
I will take responsibility
and ensure that the employee

00:52:42.181 --> 00:52:44.183
faces appropriate disciplinary action.

00:52:44.892 --> 00:52:45.893
I'm sorry.

00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:47.603
We'll make the service free for a year

00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:49.229
as a token of our apology--

00:52:49.313 --> 00:52:51.732
I don't need that.
Just hand me the contract.

00:52:51.815 --> 00:52:53.108
Here.

00:52:54.276 --> 00:52:56.820
-I'm so sorry.
-Goodness.

00:52:56.904 --> 00:52:59.072
Can we…

00:53:12.085 --> 00:53:13.337
What are you still doing here?

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.005
We're very sorry.

00:53:15.088 --> 00:53:16.298
Go!

00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:18.926
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

00:53:36.902 --> 00:53:39.404
Call Mr. Baek Jeong-tae.

00:53:39.488 --> 00:53:41.114
Okay. Calling.

00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:44.076
Hello, Nak-su.

00:53:44.159 --> 00:53:47.204
Sir, it's all taken care of.

00:53:47.287 --> 00:53:48.455
Okay. Well done.

00:53:48.539 --> 00:53:51.166
I gave a proper apology

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:55.003
and explained
the technical issues in detail.

00:53:55.087 --> 00:53:57.965
He agreed to upload
a follow-up video right away,

00:53:58.048 --> 00:53:59.925
and I've handled everything.

00:54:00.008 --> 00:54:02.010
It all went well.

00:54:02.094 --> 00:54:05.597
-How about Yangpyeong?
-As for Yangpyeong…

00:54:06.223 --> 00:54:09.226
It went well in Yangpyeong too.

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:10.227
It did?

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:14.064
I made sure my team knew what to do.

00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:15.232
Okay.

00:54:15.315 --> 00:54:17.609
Are you at the office?

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.279
I'm almost there.

00:54:20.362 --> 00:54:23.073
If you haven't eaten,
shall we grab dinner?

00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:24.074
No.

00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:26.034
I'm actually with someone now.

00:54:26.577 --> 00:54:29.121
Are you? Okay.

00:54:29.621 --> 00:54:31.081
Good job today.

00:54:31.164 --> 00:54:32.541
-Jeong-tae!
-What?

00:54:33.417 --> 00:54:35.586
I'm sorry. I'll do better.

00:54:36.128 --> 00:54:37.254
Okay.

00:54:37.337 --> 00:54:39.256
-I'll do better!
-Okay.

00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:40.257
I--

00:54:47.598 --> 00:54:50.559
What's the point
of nagging him over and over

00:54:50.642 --> 00:54:52.436
when he just doesn't get it?

00:54:56.648 --> 00:54:58.525
He's still stuck with the mindset

00:54:58.609 --> 00:55:01.778
of a student waiting
for his homework to be checked.

00:55:01.862 --> 00:55:04.489
I'm seriously fuming.

00:55:05.741 --> 00:55:06.825
Let me.

00:55:13.874 --> 00:55:16.251
Should we order some more tuna belly?

00:55:16.335 --> 00:55:17.252
Sounds good.

00:55:17.878 --> 00:55:19.254
Ms. Woo.

00:55:20.422 --> 00:55:22.049
I'm just glad things worked out well.

00:55:24.509 --> 00:55:25.928
Where were we?

00:55:27.262 --> 00:55:30.223
MVP.

00:55:30.891 --> 00:55:31.850
Right.

00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:33.352
SONG IK-HYEON

00:55:33.435 --> 00:55:35.520
-Hello, Ik-hyeon.
-Mr. Kim.

00:55:35.604 --> 00:55:37.481
We're just leaving Yangpyeong now.

00:55:37.564 --> 00:55:38.982
Okay. How did everything go?

00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:41.443
It's been taken care of for now.

00:55:41.526 --> 00:55:43.487
I don't think they'll take it to court.

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:45.322
What a relief.

00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:47.532
It went well with the YouTuber too.

00:55:47.616 --> 00:55:48.867
I told you.

00:55:48.951 --> 00:55:51.703
People who live off ads and sponsorships
will always fold.

00:55:51.787 --> 00:55:54.164
I showed up, frowned, and pointed out

00:55:54.247 --> 00:55:56.667
that it clearly says
"construction planned."

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.086
He panicked
and said he'd delete the video,

00:55:59.169 --> 00:56:00.087
then apologized.

00:56:01.213 --> 00:56:02.839
You should have seen it.

00:56:03.757 --> 00:56:04.633
Well done, sir.

00:56:04.716 --> 00:56:08.261
What did they say when you told them
we'd waive their fees?

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.057
They declined and asked
to cancel the contract,

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.059
so we canceled it
without the termination fee.

00:56:14.142 --> 00:56:15.727
I see.

00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:17.604
That was the best we could do.

00:56:18.313 --> 00:56:19.398
Okay.

00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:20.857
I'm sorry about today.

00:56:22.734 --> 00:56:23.610
Don't worry about it.

00:56:23.694 --> 00:56:26.738
It's not like they were
a major client or anything.

00:56:26.822 --> 00:56:27.864
You know?

00:56:27.948 --> 00:56:30.951
Let's just work hard
and find us more clients, okay?

00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:33.036
Okay. Have a good night, sir.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.456
You guys must be hungry.
Let's have dinner.

00:56:37.207 --> 00:56:38.083
Dinner?

00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:40.669
You've done so well today.

00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:42.546
We should have a company dinner.

00:56:42.629 --> 00:56:44.297
Everyone's coming, right?

00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:46.174
Yes, but…

00:56:46.258 --> 00:56:47.801
Let's go to Ttokdari Diner.

00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:50.387
Days like this call for a drink.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.431
Let me ask them first.

00:56:52.514 --> 00:56:54.433
What do you mean? Aren't you on speaker?

00:56:54.516 --> 00:56:56.351
Come if you're free.

00:56:56.435 --> 00:56:58.854
I'm almost there. I'll order first.

00:56:58.937 --> 00:57:00.022
Pork neck for you, Song-hee.

00:57:00.105 --> 00:57:01.106
That's right!

00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:03.316
We'll call you back, Mr. Kim.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.110
No need to do that!

00:57:05.193 --> 00:57:07.612
Just come if you're free.
Don't force yourself if you're tired.

00:57:07.696 --> 00:57:09.156
I'll see you all soon.

00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:10.407
Mr. Kim.

00:57:12.409 --> 00:57:15.078
Great.

00:57:15.162 --> 00:57:16.913
Do you two

00:57:17.414 --> 00:57:18.457
have plans tonight?

00:57:20.459 --> 00:57:22.335
Dinner with my boyfriend.

00:57:22.836 --> 00:57:24.713
I made a reservation a month ago.

00:57:25.464 --> 00:57:28.383
It's on a whole different level
from Ttokdari Diner.

00:57:29.176 --> 00:57:30.635
And you, Sung-gu?

00:57:30.719 --> 00:57:33.138
The fifth round of the wedding dress hunt.

00:57:33.722 --> 00:57:35.140
The fifth round?

00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:38.351
Are there even
any dresses left for her to try on?

00:57:38.435 --> 00:57:39.853
What do you say?

00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:46.526
I'll set course for Ttokdari.

00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.111
Why is there no end to my work?

00:57:48.195 --> 00:57:49.696
-Why?
-Seriously.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.323
I hate this.

00:57:51.406 --> 00:57:53.658
-Babe.
-Hi, honey.

00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:55.285
-I…
-I'm sorry, but…

00:57:55.368 --> 00:57:57.829
Why is everybody apologizing?

00:58:04.336 --> 00:58:05.212
Okay.

00:58:06.129 --> 00:58:07.964
Hello. Table for four, please.

00:58:08.882 --> 00:58:10.383
-Drinks?
-One soju and two beers.

00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:13.095
Will you order the meat
after the rest of your party arrives?

00:58:13.178 --> 00:58:14.763
No, they'll be here any minute.

00:58:14.846 --> 00:58:16.640
Four pork belly and two pork neck.

00:58:16.723 --> 00:58:18.558
-Okay.
-Please be quick.

00:58:19.392 --> 00:58:21.269
I'm starving.

00:58:32.864 --> 00:58:34.074
So sweet.

00:58:34.783 --> 00:58:37.369
The soju sure tastes sweet tonight.

00:58:40.997 --> 00:58:42.749
You've got mail.

00:58:58.306 --> 00:58:59.558
Good work today, sir.

00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:01.351
-Good work today, sir.
-Good work today, sir.

00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:04.062
-Hi. Good job today. Sit down.
-Ma'am! One soju and a beer!

00:59:04.146 --> 00:59:07.440
We happened to be hungry
right when you called to invite us to eat.

00:59:07.524 --> 00:59:08.525
We were so excited.

00:59:14.573 --> 00:59:16.283
Let's go for a single today.

00:59:16.366 --> 00:59:17.701
I'm still hungover.

00:59:18.326 --> 00:59:20.287
Still? We all drank together.

00:59:21.121 --> 00:59:22.831
Someone got a hole-in-one.

00:59:22.914 --> 00:59:24.040
You're right.

00:59:24.124 --> 00:59:25.792
That's one lucky guy.

00:59:25.876 --> 00:59:27.169
The guy in the middle got it?

00:59:27.252 --> 00:59:28.503
CONGRATULATIONS
HOLE-IN-ONE

00:59:28.587 --> 00:59:29.796
Looks like it.

00:59:30.463 --> 00:59:31.339
Wait.

00:59:32.674 --> 00:59:34.342
That's Choi Sang-pil, isn't it?

00:59:34.426 --> 00:59:35.844
You're right.

00:59:35.927 --> 00:59:37.596
Choi Sang-pil of LK Telecom!

00:59:37.679 --> 00:59:39.598
That one is the managing director of ACT.

00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:42.058
They're the sales directors
from the three major telecoms.

00:59:42.142 --> 00:59:43.476
You're right.

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.687
Why would those pricks all gather here?

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:47.772
Come on. Let's just go.

00:59:47.856 --> 00:59:50.400
-Let's go.
-Hang on a minute.

00:59:56.156 --> 00:59:57.324
Mr. Choi Sang-pil.

00:59:57.866 --> 01:00:00.911
It's been a while. What's with your tone?

01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:02.454
I'm hurt.

01:00:03.288 --> 01:00:04.831
It's not like we're cops.

01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:08.835
Me? I'm at Suwon Country Club.

01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:12.464
I just saw your photo.

01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:13.590
KIM NAK-SU

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:15.258
Korea Fair Trade Commission?

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:17.510
I guess he happened to see

01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:19.429
that hole-in-one photo from back then.

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:20.472
And?

01:00:20.555 --> 01:00:22.933
He just made some small talk and hung up,

01:00:23.016 --> 01:00:24.434
but I know that bastard.

01:00:24.517 --> 01:00:26.561
He's not the type
to call without a reason.

01:00:29.147 --> 01:00:32.400
Are you saying
he caught a whiff of something?

01:00:32.484 --> 01:00:35.570
One hundred percent.
He's a total Fair Trade Commission whiz.

01:00:35.654 --> 01:00:37.864
I was just on the phone
with Mr. Yoon from TU.

01:00:37.948 --> 01:00:40.033
We should lay low for the time being.

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:42.535
We don't want
to be suspected of colluding.

01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:44.537
They're like Dobermans.

01:00:44.621 --> 01:00:46.456
Once they bite, they never let go.

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:48.416
Okay. I understand.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.377
I can't believe that hole-in-one

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.545
is coming back to bite us like this.

01:00:54.339 --> 01:00:56.925
-I'm sorry.
-Let's be careful for now.

01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:34.421
Fine dust hit 185 micrograms
in Daegwallyeong, Gangwon Province,

01:01:34.504 --> 01:01:36.381
and 209 in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province.

01:01:41.303 --> 01:01:44.389
I've done my part.

01:01:45.307 --> 01:01:48.435
Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gangwon,
as well as Chungcheong and Jeolla…

01:01:57.986 --> 01:02:00.572
ASAN FACTORY SAFETY MANAGEMENT
TEAM LEADER RECRUITMENT NOTICE

01:02:00.697 --> 01:02:03.450
POSITION: GENERAL MANAGER OR ABOVE
20+ YEARS EXPERIENCE PREFERRED

01:02:05.368 --> 01:02:06.619
IF THERE ARE NO APPLICANTS

01:02:06.703 --> 01:02:08.580
MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT MAY BE ISSUED

01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:10.582
I'm going to Ulleungdo Island.

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.584
They told me to go manage the facilities.

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:15.920
-Show us what you got.
-You really are running out of time.

01:02:16.004 --> 01:02:19.049
Those bastards never planned on sending me
to Ulleungdo in the first place.

01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:20.425
You have to change.

01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:22.010
-They want me to quit on my own.
-Nak-su!

01:02:22.097 --> 01:02:23.970
If we get an administrative sanction…

01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:27.140
-We'll easily lose tens of billions.
-The company won't handle it for you.

01:02:27.223 --> 01:02:28.391
They won't wait for you!

01:02:28.475 --> 01:02:30.818
Living a long life
would be a disaster for me.

01:02:30.894 --> 01:02:32.643
Just say sorry and be done with it.

01:02:32.735 --> 01:02:34.655
Why is your team falling
so far behind Do Jin-woo's?

01:02:34.731 --> 01:02:38.068
-…I'd make him managing director.
-I don't think we can solve this that way.

01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:39.610
You must have thought about it too.

01:02:39.736 --> 01:02:42.072
Why weren't you answering, Mr. Kim?
Please take care of…

01:02:42.155 --> 01:02:43.782
-Have a great life!
-…enter this room…

01:02:43.865 --> 01:02:45.575
-What's so great, Dad?
-…ashamed as a mother.

01:02:45.658 --> 01:02:46.973
You have to take responsibility…

01:02:47.123 --> 01:02:50.580
-…lose my chance at becoming an executive?
-…for all the choices you made.

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:53.792
We decided to send him to Asan.

01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:58.046
I'm the one who made the call.

01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:03.968
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:22.529
MISSED CALL
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

01:03:22.862 --> 01:03:23.738
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

01:03:39.629 --> 01:03:40.672
FINE DUST LEVEL
VERY HIGH

01:04:20.003 --> 01:04:24.883
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:04:55.079 --> 01:04:57.957
You know better than anyone
how hard I've worked at ACT

01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.375
for the past 25 years.

01:04:59.459 --> 01:05:01.294
I'm still useful to the company.

01:05:02.295 --> 01:05:04.631
Executives are always
on the company's side.

01:05:04.714 --> 01:05:07.091
You're not in a gang.
It's not about loyalty and betrayal.

01:05:07.175 --> 01:05:09.234
Let's go make some sales.
Let's get out there.

01:05:09.302 --> 01:05:11.137
It's been a while, hasn't it?

01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:14.265
I'll shatter it.
Like a bird breaking out from its shell,

01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:15.975
I'll break your company's shell

01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:18.228
so that you guys can fly.

01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:20.396
Is Nak-su

01:05:21.105 --> 01:05:22.565
out of the office again?

01:05:23.858 --> 01:05:26.444
Isn't Nak-su going to be an executive now?

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:30.782
I guess having experience
really does make a difference.

01:05:30.865 --> 01:05:31.991
Help me out, guys.

01:05:32.534 --> 01:05:33.409
If you do,

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:36.496
I promise to give you
great performance reviews.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.962
