[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.910
[Episode 17]

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.229
So, Senior,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.310
you're not here to arrest Mr. Tang?

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.509
To prevent any leaks,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.820
only the Sword Master,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.680
Master Puzhu,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.880
and I know about this.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.630
You're too honest.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.490
I was worried you might expose us.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.759
Then why

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.610
did you want to arrest Mr. Tang
outside the city?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.150
By catching him,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.640
I could bring him to Biluo Palace

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.920
and use him as leverage

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.350
to request an audience
with Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.950
That would

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.310
make everything more convincing.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.039
Then why did Mr. Tang try to escape?

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.039
Did he?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.010
He was just traveling with me.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.610
Cheng Yunpao's target

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.120
was never Tang Lici.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.830
Tang Lici was just a pretext

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.430
for him to achieve

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.280
his real purpose—

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.640
secretly getting inside

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.470
Biluo Palace.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.150
So,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.210
you believe Mr. Tang is a good person?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.020
He may not be evil,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.850
but that doesn't make him
a good man either.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.079
He deliberately made himself conspicuous

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.960
to attract Fengliu Shop

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.190
and the swordsmen hunting him,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.000
all to hold back his strength for today

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.630
and force Palace Chief Wanyu

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.120
to aid the Sword Alliance.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.490
Maybe the reason

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.600
Palace Chief Wanyu

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.680
sheltered those from Fengliu Shop

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.820
was that Tang Lici's methods
were too extreme

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.950
and displeased him.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.150
I see.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.360
Currently, there's no need

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.890
for Master Cheng to act yet.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.430
Tonight,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.580
our biggest problem

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.300
is Xifang Tao.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.190
That girl's cunning

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.120
is no less than Liu Yan's.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.520
At present,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680
I haven't yet formed a true alliance

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.960
with Biluo Palace,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.440
which means Fengliu Shop

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.380
still has a chance to act.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.180
Tonight,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.490
she's sure to make her move.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.550
Even if that's true,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.190
we...

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.840
we are not allowed to fight

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.170
in Biluo Palace anyway.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.910
What...

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.910
can we do in here?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.320
You'll have to ask Palace Chief Wanyu

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.960
what he wants

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.430
and why he's housing us

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.840
separately.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.190
Also...

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.310
there's the hint

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.630
Bi Lianyi just gave us.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.240
The hint?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.150
There are 7 of them,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.079
but only 5 of you.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.740
This isn't fair to you.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.790
The Palace Chief
doesn't only care about the outcome,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.390
but also your performances.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.030
After nightfall,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.630
that's when we get our chance to act.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.769
But aren't there guards
patrolling at night?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.959
How can we act?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.390
Perhaps...

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.870
he wants us to avoid these guards

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.160
when we act.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.390
The reason Palace Chief Wanyu

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.560
deliberately separated us

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.510
must be that

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.310
he wants us

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.570
to do certain things

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.790
in Zixiao Courtyard.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.340
And these things

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.100
are his test for us.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.690
If we do them right,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.240
he'll cooperate with the Sword Alliance.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.170
If we fail

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.270
and make Palace Chief Wanyu

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.400
think we're idiots,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.360
Biluo Palace

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.470
will side with Fengliu Shop.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.520
So what should we do?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.240
Before we do anything,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.310
we need to understand

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.510
the rule of this game.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.830
Isn't the rule

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.159
that we can't fight?

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.410
Perhaps...

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.350
that's not really a rule,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.270
but a loophole.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.159
Where's that drum sound coming from?

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.310
It's giving me a headache!

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.360
Now is the time.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.190
Morning bells and evening drums.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.190
Night has fallen.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.460
The show is about to begin.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.840
Madam, what do you mean?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.890
If you want to survive,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.310
don't go outside.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.830
These evil people

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.310
won't just sit and wait for death.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.260
Now that night has fallen,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.830
I'll find out what they're planning.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.040
We'd better reach

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.680
Palace Chief Wanyu before they do.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.430
Stay here

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.750
and don't act rashly.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.680
Wait for my news.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.190
Okay.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.960
If you encounter danger,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.440
just call out.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.560
Why such a hurry?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.250
Isn't Senior Brother a bad navigator?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.190
Being alone, how can he...

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.680
Senior!

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.070
Senior!

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.070
Senior!

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.710
Palace Chief,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.770
six people have left their rooms.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.390
As you predicted,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.010
they've started to act.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.510
I've checked.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.390
Xifang Tao and Fucui

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.540
have left their rooms.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.310
There are only 16 guards

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.640
patrolling the entire Zixiao Courtyard.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.950
Too few.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.010
It seems Xifang Tao

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.310
has also noticed the key.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.390
The one who noticed the key

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.540
is the opposition's critical target.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.070
Which directions did they head?

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.160
Xifang Tao went west,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.290
and Fucui went east.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.430
The Zixiao Courtyard
is laid out like a chessboard,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.360
with long corridors and many rooms.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.680
But they can't use
the Shadow Concealment Technique.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.340
Checking every room thoroughly

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.140
won't be easy.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.720
Good.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.270
I'll go after Xifang Tao,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.590
and you follow Fucui.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.120
Let's do this according to the plan.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.510
Okay.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:01.870
Senior!

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:03.950
Senior!

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.030
Just waiting here

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.360
is so boring!

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.260
I want to go out to find them too.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.600
My lightness skill

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.200
is clearly most useful here.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.440
Chi, I know you

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.640
want to find Miss Bai.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.120
Thank you for protecting me.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.730
I can still tell what's most important

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.390
and what can wait.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.670
We're on the move,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.390
and they definitely are too.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.960
Right now, the rear

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.960
is the weakest point for both sides.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.230
Forget it.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.120
In Sword King City,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.250
I was careless once.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.750
This time,
I'll make sure to keep you safe.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.880
That's a good thing.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.410
Why did Biluo Palace

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.750
build so many

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.000
identical houses?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.960
Senior!

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.200
Senior!

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.360
Mr. Tang?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.620
Don't speak so loudly.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.550
Be careful not to reveal our location.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.350
What's wrong?

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.900
Isn't fighting forbidden

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.100
inside Biluo Palace?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.250
It is,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.250
but what if no one finds out?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.910
Tonight, there will be patrols

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.240
in Zixiao Courtyard.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.440
While they're patrolling,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.900
we can't be seen fighting.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.200
If we are caught,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.070
we'll be locked up.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.390
If the patrollers don't see it,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.630
it doesn't count as fighting.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.330
Palace Chief Wanyu surely knows

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.240
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.900
and Fengliu Shop are enemies.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.200
He separated all of us

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.950
into different rooms

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.720
to see

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.550
who on each side

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.200
could identify the key points

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.390
and take charge,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.350
and whether teammates
have any tacit understanding

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.710
to help each other.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.870
The guards here

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.150
are surprisingly few.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.630
His goal

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.000
is to watch us fight each other.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.150
How will he determine the results?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.840
The side

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.200
with more people down

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.670
will be the loser.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.530
What should we do then?

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.490
I'll go find Master Cheng.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.680
Chi Yun's room

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.350
is in the second column from the east,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.810
second row from the north.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.630
You...

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.550
Master Cheng,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.870
you must be very careful.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.760
Why did he suddenly go quiet?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.690
What are you doing?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.590
The Tai'e Sword!

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.340
Good people are always so well-behaved.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.070
Presumptuous!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.340
Where is she hiding?

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.660
I'll find you.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.270
It's you,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.150
Tang Lici?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.440
That enchantress from Fengliu Shop

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.020
broke the rule.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.870
She used force.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.960
Master Cheng, who are you planning

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960
to report this to?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.270
As long as we aren't caught,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.400
it doesn't count as breaking the rule.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.440
But...

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.270
the Sword Master's token,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.130
the Tai'e Sword, was taken by her.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.440
Gu Xitan—

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.360
he's in the first room on the left

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.670
after passing two pavilions to the east.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.870
He's with Chi Yun.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.270
You go find them first

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.690
and save your strength.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.750
I'll go retrieve the Tai'e Sword.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.670
Can I trust you?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.440
If you don't trust me,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.770
who else can you trust?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.950
Master Cheng.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.270
Master Cheng!

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.560
East is that way.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.680
I don't need you to tell me.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.000
Palace Chief,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.030
who do you think will win?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.860
Steward Bi,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960
observe the stars

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.440
with your eyes

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.440
and perceive them with your heart.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.670
The rooms in Zixiao Courtyard

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.320
are arranged in 6 rows and 6 columns.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.270
In total there are 3600 of them.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.000
When I found Gu Xitan

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.800
in the 1st corridor to the north,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.480
Cheng Yunpao and Xifang Tao

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.200
were fighting at the pavilion

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.930
where the 4th and 5th corridors
to the north meet.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.880
Xifang Tao took the Tai'e Sword
and escaped.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:19.870
Cheng Yunpao met me

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.320
at the intersection
of the 2nd corridor to the north

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.120
and the 4th corridor to the east.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.470
North of there

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.740
is the courtyard wall.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.360
To the east, she'd have to go past Chi Yun

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.240
and Shui.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.030
The only possibility is...

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.490
There are many rules
in the martial arts world.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.240
When we first enter
the martial arts world,

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.440
we knew there were things we mustn't do,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.850
like rape, robbery,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.200
murder, and arson.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.510
Some people ignore these rules,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.360
but they have their own.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.030
For example, Chi Yun is a master thief,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.120
but he only steals from the unrighteous.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.030
Shen Langhun

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.200
only takes contracts
to kill people in jianghu

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.960
and doesn't harm the weak, the elderly,
women, or children.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.840
Indeed.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.480
But there are always some people

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.010
who don't follow the rules.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.080
Like Fengliu Shop.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.750
Those who follow the righteous path

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.560
all wish to eliminate them.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.380
In jianghu, besides rules,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.510
there are other things.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.440
There's a blurry line.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.510
Some people

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.390
can exploit loopholes in the rules

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.030
without breaking them.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.270
Those are the ones who ultimately survive.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.000
And these people

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.270
will eventually become
a different kind of person.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.070
Palace Chief, are you saying...

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.770
the ones who make the rules?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.570
They are the ones

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.360
Biluo Palace should ally with.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.490
The ones who make the rules

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.790
are the ones

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.930
Biluo Palace should ally with.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.109
Madam,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:05.680
when did you

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.740
join Fengliu Shop?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.270
You don't need to know

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.819
what you're not supposed to know.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.680
Fine.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.069
I just want to know

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.200
when

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.839
Sword King...

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.400
I know

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.850
what you're thinking.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.450
You're starting to suspect...

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.030
your father.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.210
You think it's a secret?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.400
In fact, Fengliu Shop

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.200
has known it all along.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.640
Acting City Lord Yu,

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.590
it doesn't matter

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.240
whether your father

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.570
joined Fengliu Shop

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.350
or whether

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.640
he was really selling

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.900
the Blood Ghost Pills.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.440
What matters

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.570
is the outcome.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.270
And the outcome is that

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.680
when the truth was exposed,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.200
Sword King City's reputation

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.590
was ruined,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.950
the Tianyan Sword Wall was destroyed,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.310
and your father

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.640
died at Tang Lici's hands.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.520
Oh, right.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.550
Are you wondering

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.080
why I dare

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.770
to use force against you here?

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.410
When doing bad things,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.520
as long as you're not caught,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.380
it doesn't make you a bad person.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.720
Where did these bastards

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.280
go?

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.750
Good!

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.110
Here you are.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.410
The second row from the north?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.690
Who is it?

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.240
Gu?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.600
Brother Chi,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.330
Miss Shei, you're really here.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.070
Now you call me Brother?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.730
Well, my Senior isn't here.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.920
I see.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.590
Your Senior isn't here?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.310
Then aren't we

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.240
in great danger?

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.960
Exactly.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.350
Found them.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.920
They're here.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.230
Taking down 3 at once.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.750
Don't run!

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.720
You're the one getting taken down.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.450
Hold him.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.540
Don't hit my face.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.090
Get lost!

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.200
Stop!

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.720
Foxy Tang was right.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.300
You're just an idiot.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.270
All muscle,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.720
no brains.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:52.830
Fucui,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.030
you broke the rule.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.830
Come with us.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.640
Didn't you see?

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.200
They used force too!

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.890
We didn't see that.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.110
We only saw you use force

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.040
and injure them.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.400
You set me up!

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.930
That's exactly what we did.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.510
You dare use force in front of us

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.910
and offend Biluo Palace?

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.000
I don't dare!

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.760
Take him away.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.270
You'll all pay for this!

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.850
Are you alright?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.610
I'm perfectly fine.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.200
Thank you for your hard work.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.000
Foxy Tang's plan really worked.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.810
We've already taken one down.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:46.910
It's three actually.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.830
Before coming here,

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.230
I found Hua Wuyan's room,

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.440
and Lady Qingchan was in there too.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.750
By now, Tang Lici

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.560
should have captured them.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.680
Tang Lici?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.790
So Fengliu Shop

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.920
only has Bai Suche

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.050
and Xifang Tao left?

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.990
You did a good job acting just now.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680
It's Xifang Tao.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.940
Shen, let's encircle her!

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.790
Shen?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.760
Miss Shei,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.490
let's hide inside first.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.680
Why is there a floral scent?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
I don't smell it. What floral scent?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.720
Bai Suche?

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.030
Chi,

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.790
you really came?

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.480
Miss Bai,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.150
why are you...

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.480
Such a fool.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.600
Looks like West Palace Chief was right—

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.050
men

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.680
are always so easy to trick.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.670
Stay away from me from now on.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.290
Don't let me see you again.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.250
Foxy Tang, why are you here?

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.360
I was chasing Xifang Tao.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.030
She's not here?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.680
I came here

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.010
chasing Xifang Tao too.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.730
Shen even lost track of her.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.510
Xifang Tao's rouge?

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.830
Hide Yu Furen

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.560
and then wander around

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.880
to lure Chi Yun out.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.300
I'll go catch the people in the rooms.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.890
This rouge

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.030
will make them think you're me.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.030
We got trapped.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.110
Foxy Tang!

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.750
We lost Gu Xitan,

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.880
Yu Furen, and Shei;

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.480
captured Bai Suche,

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.610
Lady Qingchan,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.720
and Hua Wuyan;

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.930
and took down Fucui.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.310
We're one person ahead of Fengliu Shop.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.370
But Xifang Tao

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.960
took the token that Master Shao

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.400
gave to Master Cheng—

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.720
the Tai'e Sword.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.110
This is a significant achievement.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.240
Even though

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.100
they lost one more person than us,

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.160
in reality,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.200
they have the upper hand.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.590
Yes.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.360
Forget about Chi Yun.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.750
This time I acted impulsively

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.830
and failed to protect Shei and the others.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.640
Forget about me? What does that mean?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.770
It's not your fault.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.550
Xifang Tao targeted Chi Yun

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.480
just like we targeted Fucui.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.950
We'd all tend to go after

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.560
the most naive member
in the opposing camp.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.510
I've let everyone down.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.840
It's already 3 a.m.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.160
There's less than 2 hours

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.510
before we meet Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.240
Given the size of Zixiao Courtyard,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.790
as long as Xifang Tao

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.000
keeps moving,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.190
it'll be hard for us to catch her.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.480
Interesting.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.460
Besides finding Xifang Tao

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.060
and retrieving Tai'a Sword,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.680
I also have a way

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.010
to rescue all the captured people.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.550
Xifang Tao can hide,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:29.920
but those she caught

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.180
cannot.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.240
She must have,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:34.280
like us,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.590
hidden them in a room.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.000
And that room

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.670
is one we wouldn't check,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.400
because it originally

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.750
housed one of our own.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.380
This person is rigid

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.310
and lost something valuable.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.240
While searching for the lost item,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.350
they might have also lost themselves.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.010
You're talking about Cheng Yunpao,
aren't you?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.830
Exactly.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.750
They must be in Master Cheng's room.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.180
Why did I not only fail
to find the enchantress

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.310
but end up back here?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.550
I thought

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.210
the one who came was Tang Lici.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.970
Since you're here,

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.920
he must be searching
all over Zixiao Courtyard

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.590
to find me.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Once dawn breaks,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.230
I'll win.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.940
Let me tell you a secret.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.200
Actually, Tang Lici

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.540
never actually

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.680
wanted to kill Liu Yan.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.720
You're just a pawn

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.310
he's been using.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.510
A wooden bell?

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.110
It's time.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.030
This is a wooden bell

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.440
I made with my own hands.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.310
It makes a sound

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.390
that only I can hear.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.310
Mr. Tang, it seems

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.480
you are not only exceptional
in martial arts and intelligence,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.010
but also in craftsmanship.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.550
A good hunter

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.000
often

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.300
disguises himself as prey.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.750
Miss Xifang,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.400
we meet again.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.790
Miss Xifang?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.350
The Tai'e Sword

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.810
has returned
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.400
Mr. Tang, you only won a small round.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.200
This is not a victory.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.750
It's not dawn yet.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.180
Mr. Tang,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.610
don't get separated from those around you.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.830
Enchantress,

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.670
give me back the Tai'e Sword!

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.760
Master Cheng!

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.760
You got the Tai'e Sword back?

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.650
This is my room.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:09.960
Why is everyone here?

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.090
Where is Bandit Chi?

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.280
Master Cheng,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.550
you'd better

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.240
not leave

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.300
this room anymore.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.400
The Tai'e Sword

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.300
has returned
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.870
Everything's settled.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.410
Dawn should be breaking soon.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.030
Looks like

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.510
Tang Lici and Xifang Tao

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.940
have already decided the winner.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.720
Master Cheng,

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.550
Mr. Tang.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.060
Congratulations.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.510
The Palace Chief will only see one person.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.510
Which one of you is going to meet him?

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.550
I'm just the middleman.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.199
Master Cheng is here

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.070
on behalf of
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.590
So,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.880
Master Cheng should be the one to go.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.260
Please.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.250
I'll go right away.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.320
I'm Cheng Yunpao from Camellia Island,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.920
a branch
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.870
Greetings, Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.480
Why is the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.840
visiting Biluo Palace?

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.030
What?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.680
The negotiation failed?

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.480
Rigid Cheng, you...

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.130
Who are you talking to, Bandit Chi?

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.190
I'm talking to you!

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.960
We worked all night

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.280
and finally got a chance

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.740
to meet that palace chief.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880
And you messed it up?

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.440
What if he allies with Fengliu Shop

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.370
and kills us to show his sincerity?

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.150
Foxy Tang,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.290
don't you agree?

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.010
Where are you going?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.000
I've fulfilled my promise,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.840
so I'll leave.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.000
Wait.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.400
Biluo Palace

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.280
didn't agree

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.480
to ally with the Sword Alliance, did it?

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.800
So what?

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.780
My agreement with Master Puzhu

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.960
was only to introduce
the envoy of the Sword Alliance

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.560
to the chief of Biluo Palace.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.070
Whether

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.960
an alliance is formed

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.740
is none of my concern.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.670
If Biluo Palace

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.190
is going to ally with the Sword Alliance,

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.650
Liu Yan would surely come.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.110
He won't let this happen.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.600
Master Cheng,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.040
how did you negotiate

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.450
with Palace Chief Wanyu?

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.190
Why is the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.590
visiting Biluo Palace?

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:18.960
The Wanyu clan

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.280
was framed by Yique Yinyang

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.080
and fled here.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.520
You've lived in seclusion for 30 years.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.150
Now, Fengliu Shop
is wreaking havoc in jianghu.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.860
The Blood Ghost Pills they are spreading

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.660
are a poison Yique Yinyang left.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.770
This Tai'e Sword

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.320
was left by Jiangnan Feng,
the ancestor of the Sword Alliance.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.630
It represents the authority
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.070
I,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.840
entrusted by Master Shao

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.110
and bearing this sword
as a token of sincerity,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.630
earnestly request the Wanyu clan,
the former Imperial Preceptor,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.820
for the sake of your past vengeance

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.930
and present justice,

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.060
to join forces with the Sword Alliance

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.770
to oppose Fengliu Shop
for all under heaven.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.550
Is this

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.480
the sincerity
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.030
I am truly disappointed.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.060
Palace Chief Wanyu...

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.320
Invite Miss Xifang here.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.960
Yes.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.350
Master Cheng,

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.320
you're really naive.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.070
It's no surprise at all

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.070
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.600
can't defeat Fengliu Shop.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:51.760
Mr. Tang,

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.840
why are you being so sarcastic?

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.050
Forming an alliance

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.030
is simply exchanging your conditions

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.630
for those of the other party.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.190
Did Master Shao mention

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.370
any conditions

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:02.590
the Sword Alliance

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.480
could offer Biluo Palace before you left?

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:04.960
No.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.030
He only told me to form an alliance

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.860
with Biluo Palace no matter what.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.260
Then what should I do now?

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.410
What conditions

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.590
should I offer

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.930
Palace Chief Wanyu?

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.000
You should consider

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.150
what Palace Chief Wanyu

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.840
needs.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:23.910
Doesn't Biluo Palace

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.130
just want to return to the Central Plains?

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.550
I'm Xifang Tao, Palace Chief

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.480
of the West Palace of Fengliu Shop.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.120
Greetings, Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.110
In Biluo Palace,

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:48.290
only the Palace Chief can be addressed
as Palace Chief.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.300
I apologize for my rudeness.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.400
I, Xifang Tao,

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.090
pay my respects to Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.730
You requested to enter Biluo Palace.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.060
What do you want to say?

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.320
Fengliu Shop is willing to offer

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.760
one-third of the martial arts world

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.190
to invite you

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.510
to join Fengliu Shop.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.600
The world
doesn't belong to Fengliu Shop yet.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.360
If you agree,

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.710
who in this world

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.730
could possibly stop the alliance

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.930
of Biluo Palace and Fengliu Shop?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.510
But last night, Fengliu Shop's

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.370
performance in Zixiao Courtyard

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.440
was not enough to prove this point.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.280
Palace Chief Wanyu, perhaps you should

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.070
focus on more practical matters.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.920
Xifang Tao,

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.880
mind your words.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.760
The fall of the former dynasty

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.840
was closely related to

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.710
the old Palace Chief's recommendation

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.710
of Yique Yinyang.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.400
Now that the dynasty has changed,

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.820
no one can stop Biluo Palace

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.700
from returning to the Central Plains,

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.510
but people still vividly remember

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.070
the suffering of those years.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.070
Will the people

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.360
truly not hold the Wanyu clan accountable?

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.260
Presumptuous!

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.840
If you help the Sword Alliance,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.960
Biluo Palace will remain Biluo Palace,

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.230
never greater
than the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.690
this righteous alliance.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.760
You may even

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.820
be constrained

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.960
by your past mistakes.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.750
But joining Fengliu Shop is different.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.760
If Biluo Palace joins Fengliu Shop,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.700
Fengliu Shop promises

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.440
to give one-third
of the martial arts world

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.170
under Biluo Palace's control,

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.320
and Fengliu Shop
will not interfere in the slightest.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.400
Palace Chief Wanyu,

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.120
why don't you lead Biluo Palace

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.050
to dominate the martial arts world

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.930
and restore the Wanyu clan's honor?

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.500
Master Cheng brought the Tai'e Sword.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.910
And what did you bring?

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.290
to prove your promised conditions?

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.840
What I brought are my words,

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.170
spoken with authority.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.380
No proof is needed.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.630
Miss Xifang,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.360
please return to Zixiao Courtyard to rest.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.070
I...

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.520
will give you my answer later.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.630
Mr. Tang.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.190
Fucui

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.460
has been released.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.780
Master Cheng

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.270
requested
to meet Palace Chief Wanyu again.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.090
But Palace Chief Wanyu refused to see him.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.090
Wanyu Yuedan won't see Master Cheng,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.550
because

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.910
the current Sword Alliance

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.230
cannot offer Palace Chief Wanyu

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.190
what he wants.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.800
What about Fengliu Shop?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.480
Miss Shei, please have a seat.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.280
What kind of person

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.360
do you think Wanyu Yuedan is?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.510
A master.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.510
He is not a master.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.760
He's a king.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.000
A king?

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.810
He's a king of jianghu,

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.490
who bows to no one

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.320
and submits to no threat.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.630
When weak,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.680
he flees to the ends of the earth.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.610
When strong,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.360
he rules the world.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.990
Biluo Palace was destroyed

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.190
when Wanyu Moru was ruling,

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.150
yet it was reborn

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.880
under Wanyu Yuedan's control.
