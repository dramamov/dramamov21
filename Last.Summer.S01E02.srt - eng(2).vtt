00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:35.390
This way.

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:36.891
Thank you.

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:39.269
Do-ha.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:41.563
Ta-da!

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.232
This is your room.

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:07.297
Do-ha, today
is your big architectural debut.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.176
Now go on, do whatever you feel like.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.095
For real?
So I can just drill anywhere I want?

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.432
Not anywhere, wait.
That won't do. Hold on for a second.

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:26.774
What is this?

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:34.824
I first met Song Ha-gyeong
in the summer when I was 12.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.535
By age 12,

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:39.704
she was already crazy.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.625
I'm pretty sure it was genetic.

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:46.836
This peanut house
was built by crazy grown-ups.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:51.132
I don't want to.
Dad, I seriously almost lost my vision.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.176
Why the room next to hers?

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.386
Ha-gyeong did that because she's shy.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.972
She's cute once you get to know her.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:01.184
Dad's judgment hasn't been reliable.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:03.686
That's refreshing.

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.481
It's okay, eat up.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:10.318
-Our daughters are so cute, right?
-Yes.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.821
No, they're fake daughters.
I'm your only real daughter!

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:16.491
You're lying.
You're the one who's super ugly.

00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:18.743
-Stop.
-It's true. She's ugly.

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.913
-Ha-gyeong.
-You can't do that.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:22.997
Hey.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.584
-Stop!
-Why?

00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:28.920
-Stop it.
-Hey, you.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.130
-Hey!
-You two, stop it already!

00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:32.757
-Man!
-Do-ha!

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.554
Ha-gyeong.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:42.433
Our very first war
started at the dining table.

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:49.065
You two can't come out
until you sincerely make up.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.049
Hey, that's a wooden wall,
your head can't smash it.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.054
I guess it might, with that thick head.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:23.558
You jerk!

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:30.273
Is this Yong-e Hyeoltu?
You suck so bad.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.903
Hey, lose a round,
and you'll be calling me "boss" forever.

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.865
Hold up.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:43.036
If I lose,
are you sure you can deal with me?

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.787
I thought she sounded crazy.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:53.296
PERFECT VICTORY

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.756
-Okay!
-Seriously!

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:57.425
PERFECT VICTORY

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.554
-You can't beat me.
-One more round.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:02.722
START FIGHT

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.016
If you go easy on me, I'll kill you.

00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:10.480
Are you kidding me?

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:13.983
PERFECT VICTORY - WIN

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:16.694
After losing 60 rounds straight,

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:21.407
she yelled all night
that she'd kill me if I went easy on her.

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:27.997
I won! Did you see that?
That's how I do it.

00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:31.959
When she finally got her first win,
I passed out tired.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:37.673
Our first truce happened
while we were both too tired to function.

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:39.092
JOHN'S TREE STORY

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:43.346
She said the main character resembled me

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:45.139
and tried to name the tree.

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:47.725
-It's Jong-man.
-No, it's Baek Do-ha.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.186
No, it's Jong-man…

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:52.772
That sparked our second war…

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:56.359
Forget it. Fine, let's go with Jong-man.

00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:58.778
What? You got no backbone?

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.155
Our second truce was reached
in the silliest way.

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:03.116
I'll name it Su-bak. Su-bak.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.784
That's so tacky.

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.619
Remember the first time we saw him?

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.414
He ate watermelon till his fur turned red.

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:12.500
You're so naive,
that's why you're never first.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:18.881
-What?
-You're always throwing stuff.

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.800
You're picking a fight, huh?

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:22.718
For the next 15 years…

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:23.928
Su-bak.

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:29.725
…we went through 99 wars and 99 truces.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.022
SU-BAK

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:39.193
Hey, you're officially Su-bak from now on.

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:44.448
Did Ha-gyeong know?
I've always, every single time,

00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.118
let her win eventually.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.161
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:49.620
How could you do that?

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:51.038
And…

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:52.623
Say something, Do-ha.

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:54.292
In the summer of 2022…

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.794
Make an excuse, at least!

00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:00.798
…our 100th war broke out.

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:03.718
Get lost.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:06.554
Back then, I didn't realize…

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:07.972
Let's never see each other.

00:06:09.098 --> 00:06:10.349
…that our war…

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.268
You bastard.

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:16.105
…would last this long.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.818
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.448
Do you still hate me so much?

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.075
I never realized…

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.622
you'd hate me so much.

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:41.005
Sadly, it seems Ha-gyeong still does.

00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:49.555
Yes, sir. I'm heading to my desk.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.474
I'll email you right away.

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:53.976
Yes, it can be completed by today.

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:57.772
Are you kidding me?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.358
You haven't updated him?

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.568
It's okay, I'll explain.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.946
How exactly will you do that?

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.490
Don't you know Mr. Oh's temper?
He'll freak out.

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:09.700
I'm telling you, just trust me.

00:07:12.453 --> 00:07:14.956
What's going on in that head of yours?

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:20.670
It's sturdy.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:24.340
How great is this? Neat and classy.

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:29.303
This is exactly how I wanted it.
See? This way works much better.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:32.848
Isn't it amazing how open it feels?

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:35.601
So it's true,
you eventually end up giving in.

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:38.479
What was that? Your company motto.

00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:42.441
-"A home is where people live."
-That's true.

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:47.280
I wanted my house my way, and you did
an amazing job making it happen.

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:54.912
I love it.

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:03.504
Wait, what's up with the railing?
It's completely opposite!

00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:09.176
Right? You wanted this railing in metal,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.513
and the wall over here in glass.

00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:17.059
You knew that, and still did this?
People can see into the house!

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:22.398
They can't, and you get a great view.

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:28.696
What do you think?

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:33.909
I love it.

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:37.913
It took me two whole months.

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:42.668
If this railing was metal,
like you requested,

00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:45.713
you wouldn't be able
to enjoy the view here.

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:52.303
If the whole second-floor wall is glass,
people outside can see in much easier.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.348
When you hired me to build this house,

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:57.683
it was to enjoy your retirement here.

00:08:58.225 --> 00:08:59.352
I did.

00:08:59.894 --> 00:09:05.733
From now on, you can enjoy the landscape
through all four seasons.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.781
Well done.

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:21.165
You could've ended up
getting sued this time, okay?

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:25.419
How did it turn out?
He'll even refer us to his friend.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:28.422
-You didn't catch that, huh?
-You…

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.097
I said just do one thing.

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:39.308
Either just make it how the client wants,

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:41.852
or explain a little and leave it at that.

00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:46.732
I can't. I've got to fight
to convince the resident.

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:49.026
Why are you always fighting?

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.363
Sometimes you just have
to let things go and move on.

00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:55.741
How can I just let things go?
I'm the architect here.

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:58.911
If you keep giving in, you'll regret it.

00:09:58.994 --> 00:10:01.747
No matter how long or how difficult,

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.708
we have to push through, right?

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.794
You're as stubborn as a mule.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.006
-Talk about being stubborn.
-I'm not, I'm being sincere.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.189
Do you still hate me so much?

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:35.948
Don't fool yourself. Why would I hate you?
There's nothing between us.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:42.121
Mr. Baek, to hate someone,
you have to care first.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.331
And there's nothing left between us.

00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:46.333
That's a lie.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.506
No, I don't feel anything
even when I see you.

00:10:56.343 --> 00:10:57.344
That's a lie.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.680
If that were true,

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:01.974
why would you sue
because I'm in the house?

00:11:05.186 --> 00:11:07.354
You're seriously mistaken.

00:11:07.438 --> 00:11:09.732
It's not that I hate you,
it's just ridiculous.

00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.319
How can you claim any rights to the house?

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:15.613
I've lived in it, taken care of it.

00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:18.699
What do you think you can do now?

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:22.328
Curious? About how I really feel,
even hiring a lawyer?

00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:23.871
No, not even a little.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.082
I couldn't care less about you.

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:38.802
What happened with Ha-gyeong?

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:43.807
She's been silent for an hour now,
driving me crazy.

00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:47.102
Hey.

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:52.525
"Baek Do?" You have him saved as Baek Do,
Mr. Oh Seung-taek.

00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:55.653
You must be so close. Giving him updates.

00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.279
Are you Do-ha's minion?

00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:58.280
Give it back.

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:02.910
I'm not a minion. What's that for?

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:05.412
-Just call me "hey."
-How could I do that?

00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:08.374
You're close to Mr. Baek,
and I'm suing him.

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:12.920
That's why you met him behind my back

00:12:13.754 --> 00:12:15.714
and introduced him to Mr. Seo?

00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:20.177
Why? You have that lawyer friend.

00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:22.555
The youngest son of S&J, 99% win rate,

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:24.348
who flipped the Factory case.

00:12:25.933 --> 00:12:29.270
Look, I didn't know
Su-hyeok would take the case.

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:32.231
He handles celebs and big-money clients.

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:35.109
When he took the case, I was shocked too.

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:37.861
Either way, you introduced them.

00:12:39.613 --> 00:12:41.949
This is where it ends for us.

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:43.742
Have you talked to Do-ha?

00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:47.913
-It's been two years.
-That stupid "two years."

00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:51.917
Seung-taek, it's driving me nuts.

00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:56.463
I'm telling you,
it's the same as always between us.

00:12:56.547 --> 00:12:58.507
There's nothing between us.

00:13:04.513 --> 00:13:06.807
But you know me.

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:10.603
I don't back down from a fight.

00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:14.773
Hey, what are you up to now?

00:13:16.942 --> 00:13:19.695
This security footage shows Mr. Kim Gi-man

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:23.657
spent about 11 minutes in the hotel room.

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:28.120
That's not enough time to sleep
or have sex,

00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:30.873
but plenty of time to inject a drug.

00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:36.128
It's very likely he administered drugs
in the hotel room

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:38.964
alongside his acquaintances.

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:43.010
The prosecution recommends a sentence
of two years and six months.

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:48.140
-Bingo.
-Defense counsel, you may begin your case.

00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:52.561
Why do you think

00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:56.231
the defendant couldn't
have had sex in 11 minutes?

00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:59.068
That's ridiculous.
Didn't you see the footage?

00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:03.822
The defendant was in a fencing uniform
at the hotel room.

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:07.701
That uniform takes at least eight minutes
to put on and take off.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:11.372
That means it happened
in just three minutes.

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:12.873
In three minutes.

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:15.501
Sorry?

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:18.962
-What is he talking about?
-Right.

00:14:19.797 --> 00:14:22.925
As you said, taking the uniform on and off

00:14:23.008 --> 00:14:25.636
leaves only about three minutes.
However…

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:29.348
that's more than enough for the defendant.

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.102
He's finished in a minute.

00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:37.398
If you doubt it,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.530
we're ready to submit a report
stating he has medical issues.

00:14:48.492 --> 00:14:49.618
If still in doubt,

00:14:50.494 --> 00:14:52.496
we'll submit prescriptions showing

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:54.957
he has been taking medication

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.543
for over three years.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.171
That's all.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.596
You lunatic,
almost the entire audience was reporters!

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:19.940
You told me to do whatever it took.
I did my part.

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:22.443
You can compete in the Olympics.

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:23.944
Who cares about that?

00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:28.240
All the headlines
are full of "three minutes."

00:15:28.323 --> 00:15:29.700
This is defamation.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:33.871
For just 30 minutes,
put your phone down.

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:37.916
Soon, basketball player Go's wedding
and air quality will bury this.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:42.254
People really don't care about
others' business.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.883
COURT

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:48.886
I hear your fee is 100 million won
for this case.

00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:51.889
You normally take big cases.

00:15:51.972 --> 00:15:55.684
Why would you take
the tiny peanut house case?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.604
With the Haerim Construction case,

00:15:58.687 --> 00:16:01.440
you must be swamped with court hearings.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.359
You've done plenty of research.

00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:06.820
You enjoy making the defendant look bad.

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.572
I tried to benchmark that.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:13.077
What did Do-ha say when he hired you?

00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:15.913
What are the conditions and purpose?

00:16:17.706 --> 00:16:19.833
Why should I tell you that?

00:16:23.587 --> 00:16:25.923
Why did you take the peanut house case?

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:28.801
-It's a tiny case. Makes no sense.
-It's fun.

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:30.969
Sorry?

00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:33.138
-That's all?
-Yes.

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:41.772
Give that to me.
That's why you were waiting for me.

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:49.988
Case number 2022164.

00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:53.367
Look the case up.
It's the one where S&J lost.

00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:56.161
I defended the case.

00:16:57.037 --> 00:17:00.124
You'd better back out
before it gets messier.

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:05.295
The correct way to refer to it is
Case Number 2022-Gohap-164.

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:09.591
Then you can look it up properly.
The correct term is "represented myself,"

00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:11.426
not "defended the case."

00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:15.722
I'll take a look.
It'll be fun seeing your writing again.

00:17:16.765 --> 00:17:20.477
As you know,
appeals are my area of expertise.

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:23.730
My client is thinking about
taking this to appeal.

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:25.482
You'd better brace yourself.

00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:28.318
Besides, I'm not planning to back off yet.

00:17:29.528 --> 00:17:30.612
Well then.

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:44.168
You've only lived in the house
for 21 days a year,

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:46.503
and yet you claim to know its value,

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:48.922
because you only recall the good parts,

00:17:49.006 --> 00:17:52.926
not the nightmare parts. Plus…

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.344
Is there no next part?

00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:56.680
As you said, she showed up in court.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.519
She realized I wouldn't budge,
so I figured she'd go to you.

00:18:04.313 --> 00:18:07.441
Looks like
you know everything about Ms. Song.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.320
Take a look at this too.

00:18:11.904 --> 00:18:13.739
Here's a file with the details

00:18:13.822 --> 00:18:16.909
of how Ms. Song managed the house
the last two years.

00:18:16.992 --> 00:18:19.036
She claims that because you neglected

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:22.623
your duty to manage the house,
she has more rights.

00:18:22.706 --> 00:18:26.627
She attached every receipt
to show she's been handling repairs

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.378
and maintenance alone.

00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:32.799
This part could be used
to our disadvantage.

00:18:32.883 --> 00:18:36.011
No, this part
definitely won't work against us.

00:18:42.226 --> 00:18:46.063
There were over 200 complaints in a day
during the monsoon.

00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:48.899
The word "rain" makes me feel sick.

00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:51.026
I'm worried about this year.

00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:53.612
People are worried that without the fence,

00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:56.073
the farmland will get wiped out.

00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:58.242
Headquarters called and said

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:03.288
the fence project lead needs to attend
a meeting tomorrow due to the complaints.

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:07.042
They said we need to make some adjustments
to the project.

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:11.797
And, Ms. Song,
you're the first in standby team one.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.176
If a heavy rain advisory comes in,
go and reassure the residents.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.261
This psycho!

00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:23.433
Sorry about that.

00:19:26.478 --> 00:19:28.480
Baek Do-ha, you really wanna die?

00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:35.904
What? The money you sent every month
was actually for maintenance?

00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:39.825
You think I'll buy that?
Do you really take me for a fool?

00:19:39.908 --> 00:19:43.036
You think the notices you sent make sense?

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:45.664
You exaggerated a bit too much.

00:19:47.332 --> 00:19:49.251
I only wrote the truth.

00:19:49.334 --> 00:19:51.545
You know how hard it was to manage?

00:19:52.963 --> 00:19:55.173
Forget it. Cut the crap.

00:19:55.257 --> 00:19:58.176
Why did the money for Su-bak
turn into fees?

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.095
I sent money every month.

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:01.430
What?

00:20:01.513 --> 00:20:04.641
But you still failed to do the repairs.

00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:06.101
I can't believe this.

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.729
What did I fail to do?

00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:10.981
Jong-man.

00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:17.112
On top of that, it's my private property.

00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:19.531
What happened to my tree? Explain.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.661
You know the neighbor's mulberry tree?

00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:27.247
Leaf blight got to it.

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:31.293
Trees, once they get sick,
lose leaves fast.

00:20:31.376 --> 00:20:33.712
You didn't take care of it properly.

00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:35.881
Hey, Ha-gyeong.

00:20:35.964 --> 00:20:39.426
Since coming back,
I've found many things against you.

00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:43.722
You wanna keep fighting?
If this goes to court, you'll lose.

00:20:44.264 --> 00:20:45.098
What?

00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:49.519
You damaged the fence, our common property
and cut this without consent.

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:51.480
Ha-gyeong, you won't win…

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:54.358
this time.

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:57.944
I'm not letting you win.

00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:01.323
-Letting me win?
-You didn't know?

00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:06.036
I've always, every single time…
ended up letting you win.

00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:08.497
-Why?
-Why?

00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:12.209
You ask because you don't know?

00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:22.594
Why are you doing this?
You didn't come for the house, did you?

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:30.352
You finally want to know?
You want me to tell you?

00:21:30.936 --> 00:21:32.020
No, don't tell me.

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:36.191
I don't care to hear
or know anything from you anymore.

00:21:37.234 --> 00:21:38.402
You're lying.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.154
You want to know.

00:21:47.702 --> 00:21:50.580
How would I believe what you say?

00:21:52.082 --> 00:21:55.919
You're basically a scammer,
you shameless being.

00:21:57.003 --> 00:21:58.505
Do you not feel sorry?

00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:04.678
You should've been put in jail for fraud
two years ago.

00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:10.684
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:14.563
Like I said back then,

00:22:16.064 --> 00:22:18.024
I don't feel sorry at all.

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:22.446
Ask me a hundred times, I'll say the same.

00:22:28.034 --> 00:22:31.538
Yeah, I guess that's why you did that.

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.919
Thanks for proving you're garbage
till the end.

00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:42.966
I tried to end this nicely
with lame childhood memories,

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:46.595
but fine, let's drag each other
through the mud.

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:49.848
That's the ending that suits us.

00:23:21.504 --> 00:23:22.547
Leave, leave

00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.634
Disappear

00:23:27.886 --> 00:23:29.262
Please just leave

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:31.598
Please

00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:34.893
Su-bak… isn't she really cute?

00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:39.731
She's doing the same thing as high school.

00:23:39.814 --> 00:23:42.150
She still hasn't grown up.

00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:45.695
Please get out of my sight

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:46.905
ARCHITECTURAL TEAM

00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:59.542
We're getting swamped with complaints,
you couldn't get consent forms.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:01.044
That's where we're at.

00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:04.047
I'm actively dealing with the complaints.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.925
I've got over 40% of the consent forms.

00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:09.844
You're being optimistic
when it's less than half.

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:13.598
If I sign, does it make it 41%?

00:24:30.198 --> 00:24:33.159
JEON NAM-JIN

00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:38.081
As someone living in Pacheon
and as a public architect, I agree.

00:24:38.164 --> 00:24:41.126
I'll fully agree and support

00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:43.878
whatever Ms. Song does on this project.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.009
I'll get all the consent forms.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.678
Please do that.

00:24:55.932 --> 00:24:56.975
Ms. Song.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:02.856
Hey, Ha-gyeong!
I'll give you a ride. Just hop in.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:07.777
Ha-gyeong, I've forgiven you.

00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:12.365
Even though you sued me and
I had to pay a fine using my savings,

00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:15.702
I think of it as the price of loving you.

00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:20.999
Right, you know how much people at HQ
are still badmouthing you?

00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:24.669
Every time, I've defended you.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.921
You didn't know, did you?

00:25:28.506 --> 00:25:29.632
Mr. Jeon.

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:33.011
When did you say you bought the car?

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:36.389
This, Coco,
has only been around for six months.

00:25:37.682 --> 00:25:38.767
Hop in.

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:44.564
If Coco's side mirror gets smashed,
you'd be really sad?

00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:46.358
Yeah.

00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:49.861
-You want me to make you sad?
-No, wait.

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:52.238
Hold on.

00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:54.532
Get your hands off.

00:25:55.575 --> 00:25:56.576
You'll go, right?

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.621
I should.

00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:02.415
Bye.

00:26:11.508 --> 00:26:14.594
See you around, Ha-gyeong!

00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:44.207
I'll find your treat.

00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:49.546
Where's the treat?

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:52.966
Is it over there?

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:55.927
There it is.

00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:03.768
ZOLPIDEM

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:26.958
Your phone's been ringing forever.
From Grandpa, heart?

00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:31.463
Don't be ridiculous.
My grandpa would never call me.

00:27:32.046 --> 00:27:33.214
It's ringing again.

00:27:33.715 --> 00:27:36.926
Maybe there's something wrong?
Look. It says "Grandpa."

00:27:55.445 --> 00:27:57.530
Grandpa, what's going on?

00:27:58.448 --> 00:27:59.407
Ms. Iseul?

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:01.784
Yes?

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:05.079
I've heard a lot about you
from your grandfather.

00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:08.249
I work at Daeguk Bank. I'm Yoon Jeong-han.

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:17.258
I'm sorry,
but I don't understand what's going on.

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.511
Did Grandpa take a loan…

00:28:21.095 --> 00:28:23.431
or are we having a blind date?

00:28:23.515 --> 00:28:25.475
Yes, it's not about a loan.

00:28:25.558 --> 00:28:28.186
It's a blind date. He didn't mention it?

00:28:29.854 --> 00:28:30.897
No.

00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:35.401
I'm really caught off guard right now.

00:28:36.611 --> 00:28:38.571
I have a boyfriend! I'm so sorry!

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.622
How could you do that?

00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:51.459
I've been with my boyfriend
for over ten years.

00:28:51.543 --> 00:28:54.504
I said I'd never approve of that guy.

00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:57.882
You either cut ties with me

00:28:57.966 --> 00:29:00.885
or go to that guy. Make a choice!

00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.679
I'm holding my ground

00:29:02.762 --> 00:29:06.724
by not cutting ties with you
and I'm not marrying him either.

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:09.519
I'm trying to find middle ground!

00:29:11.646 --> 00:29:13.648
Can't you see how much I'm trying?

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:17.861
And honestly, what's wrong with him?

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:22.490
He's good-looking, smart, well-educated,
from a prosecutor's family.

00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:26.703
Not that that's why I like him.

00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:30.373
Someone like him
is more than enough for me!

00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:34.168
Enough? How can he be enough for you?

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:43.011
OH SEUNG-TAEK

00:30:06.951 --> 00:30:08.036
Let's run!

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.166
ONE SHOT ONE GOAL!

00:30:13.249 --> 00:30:14.876
Oh Seung-taek!

00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:17.337
You got this!

00:30:20.548 --> 00:30:22.050
So handsome!

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:31.726
Baek-do, sit one seat away.

00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:35.563
-Why are you like this?
-Keep a proper distance.

00:30:36.522 --> 00:30:38.066
My last loyalty to Song.

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:40.443
The last loyalty.

00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:48.701
That final line is kind of short.

00:30:48.785 --> 00:30:50.995
I always settle for middle ground.

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:53.998
You and Ha-gyeong.

00:30:55.708 --> 00:30:57.085
Grandpa and Seung-taek.

00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:09.389
What?

00:31:10.807 --> 00:31:12.725
Hey, how did you get in?

00:31:13.977 --> 00:31:16.270
I came in through the common area.

00:31:16.354 --> 00:31:18.439
Don't you know the house is linked?

00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:24.237
There's a big window in the living room,
and you've got blackout curtains?

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.656
-Sleep in the room.
-Why do you care?

00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:28.783
I can sleep anywhere.

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:32.370
Of course I care.
You slept in my room too.

00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:42.797
You're welcome to sleep there.

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:47.593
What? No. Why would I sleep in your room?

00:31:47.677 --> 00:31:50.847
Yes, you did. Quite often at that.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.348
No, I didn't.

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:56.811
-Where did you get that?
-The basement.

00:32:01.816 --> 00:32:03.943
-Get out.
-What? Hey!

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:06.904
-Get out. Hey, you should go.
-What's with you?

00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:09.615
Don't come in.

00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:51.741
What?

00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:57.914
Don't you know
every house has a master key?

00:33:00.917 --> 00:33:03.586
I've been wondering about this forever.

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:08.549
How'd you pass the exam
and get into med school?

00:33:09.717 --> 00:33:10.802
Hey.

00:33:24.148 --> 00:33:25.191
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:29.028
You want the house?

00:33:30.863 --> 00:33:32.073
What's this bull?

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:34.784
Bull? We're turning 30 next year.

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:38.871
There are better words like "suggestion,"
"mercy," or "kindness."

00:33:41.624 --> 00:33:42.834
On one condition.

00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:47.755
Let's go find Jong-man together.

00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:56.013
Mr. Baek.

00:33:56.889 --> 00:34:00.143
I stayed up all night for three days
to make this.

00:34:05.106 --> 00:34:06.732
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:12.488
They have three kids.
Everything goes but the walls.

00:34:14.157 --> 00:34:15.158
Sorry?

00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:16.409
What are you doing?

00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:25.001
-Changing the design.
-Turn down Professor Kim's.

00:34:26.127 --> 00:34:27.128
CEO Choi's too.

00:34:28.254 --> 00:34:29.672
CEO Choi's…

00:34:30.631 --> 00:34:33.593
How can we reject that?
That's worth a fortune.

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:34.677
Turn it down.

00:34:39.307 --> 00:34:42.685
The completion date stays the same?

00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:47.190
This is unrealistic. Why's he doing this?

00:34:47.732 --> 00:34:50.067
I think I'm dying.

00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:54.197
The contest hasn't even been announced.
Why are we doing this?

00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:58.075
I'll settle this.

00:35:05.041 --> 00:35:06.500
PERMIT LIST
TIMELINE?

00:35:06.584 --> 00:35:09.128
Hey, Do-ha, we need to talk.

00:35:09.212 --> 00:35:12.048
Two private
and one public project left, right?

00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:13.841
Why's this taking so long?

00:35:15.009 --> 00:35:16.302
Well…

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:19.263
the person in charge went on long leave--

00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:21.307
-I know, to Jeju Island.
-Yeah.

00:35:25.228 --> 00:35:28.105
My fiancée's dress fitting is next week.

00:35:28.189 --> 00:35:31.692
I've been looking for loans,
my pride's at an all-time low.

00:35:31.776 --> 00:35:32.944
Stop that.

00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:34.070
FLIGHT BOOKED

00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:35.905
I booked the earliest one.

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:38.532
Been dumped thrice,
putting up three buildings.

00:35:38.616 --> 00:35:42.078
-She's my last chance.
-Get the permit, no matter what.

00:35:42.161 --> 00:35:44.622
Then, we should start the Patan project.

00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:48.876
I'll book the hotel too.
One day should be enough, right?

00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:51.337
Are you even human?

00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:56.968
If this Patan project doesn't work out,
you and I are done.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.514
It will work out, for sure.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:04.976
I designed it,
you went all out carving it.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.062
Summer's my lucky season.

00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:11.315
Don't look for me. I've done my bit.

00:36:12.692 --> 00:36:16.070
Make sure you eat something.
It'll be around lunchtime.

00:36:16.153 --> 00:36:17.196
ASH TREE

00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:28.499
It had thicker branches than those.

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:34.338
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

00:36:34.422 --> 00:36:38.509
Weren't we supposed to meet in front?
You should've said you came in.

00:36:38.592 --> 00:36:40.636
Sir, how much is this?

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.516
No, this one's a different variety.
Jong-man was an ash tree from Jirisan.

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:48.561
Let's go to another one.

00:37:02.074 --> 00:37:03.617
The leaves are too small.

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:10.708
The stem's kind of thick.

00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:17.214
The stem needs to be thin

00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:20.134
with the leaves spread out
for more shade.

00:37:21.844 --> 00:37:23.220
Wanna see another shop?

00:37:27.683 --> 00:37:29.769
The leaf veins are different.

00:37:30.394 --> 00:37:33.105
Jong-man's leaf veins looked really bold.

00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:37.318
You said they're like fingerprints.
How do we find the same veins?

00:37:38.444 --> 00:37:40.529
You can. There are twin trees.

00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:43.240
These trees are twins.

00:37:43.324 --> 00:37:45.493
I took the cuttings from one tree

00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:47.578
and just put it out to sell today.

00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:49.080
How about these?

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.502
-Shall we look over there?
-Shall we?

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:56.087
We'll come back.

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:02.968
Let's just get a big one.
This one looks similar.

00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:07.598
Build a childish tree house with this,
though you're 29.

00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.975
No, I'll get a small one.

00:38:10.643 --> 00:38:13.104
The same one like 17 years ago.

00:38:14.939 --> 00:38:16.607
Fine, then get a small one.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.776
Hey, this one looks the same.

00:38:20.027 --> 00:38:22.321
No, a bigger one might be better.

00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:25.908
What should I pick? I can't decide.

00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:27.535
Cut the crap, just buy it.

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:33.791
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Did you forget why we're here?

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:38.003
-Let's do our best.
-I'm already doing my best.

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:40.131
I took a half-day off for this.

00:38:40.214 --> 00:38:41.841
Who said to kill that tree?

00:38:46.178 --> 00:38:47.721
You never raised anything.

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:51.725
I did the raising while you were gone.

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.520
I took care of Su-bak and Jong-man.

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.813
You did nothing.

00:38:57.314 --> 00:38:58.524
Don't you remember?

00:38:58.607 --> 00:39:01.694
I took pictures
and sent them to you every year.

00:39:05.489 --> 00:39:06.657
You need to see it.

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:10.119
I sent this photo of Jong-man in 2013.

00:39:11.036 --> 00:39:12.788
This is in 2014.

00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:33.893
Let's hurry. Traffic's bad.

00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:40.065
-Is this from Jirisan?
-That's a different variety.

00:39:49.742 --> 00:39:52.119
Next time, let's go to a plant market.

00:39:53.454 --> 00:39:55.080
It's hard to find Jong-man.

00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:00.711
Still, we've got those.

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:04.715
They purify the air, soothe your mind,

00:40:05.424 --> 00:40:08.969
and help with insomnia.
They're especially good for insomnia.

00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:11.639
-I'll put a few in your room.
-Delete my photos.

00:40:14.058 --> 00:40:16.477
No, you sent all those Jong-man's photos.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.645
Not them.

00:40:19.063 --> 00:40:20.898
-Why?
-"Why?"

00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.691
Those are my photos.

00:40:22.775 --> 00:40:24.693
Hey, they're my photos of you.

00:40:24.777 --> 00:40:28.197
Didn't you see it on my phone?
Looks good, unlike you.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.325
-Want me to send it? For a profile pic?
-Forget it.

00:40:32.493 --> 00:40:36.080
Stick to your word.
The buyers are barely holding on.

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:37.957
Don't you say otherwise.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.919
Why do you only talk about
selling the house every time we meet?

00:40:42.002 --> 00:40:45.798
Not easy to get a buyer like that.
They won't renovate the house.

00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:49.468
If you're eager to sell it,
why turn down every single offer?

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.555
What?

00:40:56.308 --> 00:40:58.769
Well… you know…

00:40:59.728 --> 00:41:01.564
I'm close with Mr. Koo.

00:41:02.314 --> 00:41:06.068
I've heard about every buyer
who got rejected over the years.

00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:08.362
It's just that I have to

00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:11.532
sell it to a decent person
who'll keep things clean.

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:13.993
Fine, if you say so, then so be it.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.915
Let's come separately,
choose what we want, and text.

00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:23.711
And don't talk to me from now on.

00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:38.350
Does Ha-gyeong have trouble sleeping?

00:41:38.434 --> 00:41:41.645
OH SEUNG-TAEK, ONE SHOT ONE GOAL!

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.857
Did it start two years ago?

00:41:50.321 --> 00:41:51.989
Ever since then, right?

00:41:54.575 --> 00:41:55.701
She can't sleep…

00:41:57.077 --> 00:41:58.871
so she goes to a sleep clinic.

00:42:00.956 --> 00:42:03.042
I managed to get her off the pills.

00:42:03.584 --> 00:42:07.463
After her mom passed away,
her dad started wandering abroad.

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:10.090
She became the only one left.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.718
How could she get any sleep?

00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:32.363
Rosemary really works wonders.

00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:43.707
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.335
I've been watching you.

00:42:49.838 --> 00:42:51.298
Since the last time I saw you…

00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:54.343
What? Why?

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:57.680
You've really aged.

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:01.642
At our age, we need to use eye cream,
firming cream.

00:43:01.725 --> 00:43:03.352
You turn 30, too late.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.314
Get off.

00:43:15.406 --> 00:43:16.407
Ha-gyeong!

00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:27.000
Who's that?

00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:30.504
None of your business. Go on in.

00:43:31.255 --> 00:43:34.007
What are you doing here?

00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:40.973
There's no cafe around here.

00:43:41.724 --> 00:43:44.476
Hey, your neighborhood
hasn't really changed.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.439
There's nothing around, so quiet at night.

00:43:51.108 --> 00:43:52.192
Mosquito.

00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:53.819
What brings you here?

00:43:53.902 --> 00:43:56.780
-Who's he?
-Who's the guy with the attitude?

00:43:56.864 --> 00:43:59.032
Who's this rude guy?

00:43:59.116 --> 00:44:04.037
Ha-gyeong. Is he your boyfriend?

00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:08.083
You should go.
If you want to talk, just email me.

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:09.501
-Leave.
-Email? Wait.

00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:13.172
Hold on. Didn't you block me yet? Why?

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:16.800
You haven't gotten over me yet?

00:44:17.885 --> 00:44:21.096
Ha-gyeong, why do you keep giving me
a hard time?

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.932
No wonder I kept thinking about you.

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:28.061
All right, why don't we talk inside,
if that's okay?

00:44:28.145 --> 00:44:30.814
I need to talk to you.

00:44:33.776 --> 00:44:35.027
Say bye and come in.

00:44:36.612 --> 00:44:38.947
Where do you think you're going?

00:44:43.118 --> 00:44:45.245
-Who are you?
-None of your business.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.832
You should leave now.
And don't come back.

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:49.958
Stop it.

00:44:52.127 --> 00:44:54.046
Hey. Hey.

00:44:54.796 --> 00:44:59.092
Who do you think you are?

00:44:59.176 --> 00:45:03.305
Who asked you to butt in?
Ha-gyeong, is he your boyfriend or what?

00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:04.765
Stop it.

00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:06.517
You don't get it.

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:08.894
Hey! Unbelievable.

00:45:10.354 --> 00:45:12.523
Let go. Hey, let go.

00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:15.567
Let go on three or you'll regret it.

00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:16.985
One, two…

00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:27.037
I didn't fall down.
I'm just warming up.

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:29.206
Seriously.

00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:30.624
You're in big trouble.

00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:41.093
My back hurts.

00:45:43.679 --> 00:45:48.058
It's not like I wanted
to wait outside at this late hour.

00:45:48.141 --> 00:45:52.020
There are tons of mosquitos too.
See? I'm covered in sweat.

00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:54.481
I was just standing there.

00:45:54.565 --> 00:45:57.609
I saw a familiar face, so I said hi…

00:46:01.154 --> 00:46:03.490
And I ended up like this.

00:46:03.574 --> 00:46:08.495
After your breakup,
did he keep coming to see you?

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:11.498
Well, not really.

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:15.586
I know what's going on here.
You think I'm a stalker?

00:46:17.045 --> 00:46:19.673
I wasn't going to bring this up,

00:46:19.756 --> 00:46:23.719
but I'm the head of
a local architectural firm in Pacheon.

00:46:24.886 --> 00:46:25.721
So?

00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:27.598
You don't get it.

00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:31.852
My cousin is a section-chief
government official,

00:46:31.935 --> 00:46:34.021
my uncle is the township head.

00:46:34.104 --> 00:46:38.066
My aunt was just promoted
to director of construction at City Hall.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.361
I'm embarrassed to say this,

00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:44.990
but in Pacheon,
I'm a bit of a celebrity.

00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:47.576
So why would I…

00:46:49.036 --> 00:46:51.955
the 27th descendant
of the Pacheon Jeon Clan,

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:54.458
commit a crime in Pacheon…

00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:57.085
How would I dare commit a crime, Officer?

00:46:57.169 --> 00:47:00.213
Cut it out.
The officer doesn't like those antics.

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:02.090
Is your surname really Pi?

00:47:02.174 --> 00:47:05.761
Yes, I'm the 30th descendant
of the Hongcheon Pi Clan.

00:47:06.345 --> 00:47:07.638
Pleased to meet you.

00:47:10.432 --> 00:47:15.062
In this neighborhood, Song Ha-gyeong
isn't more famous than me, is she?

00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:20.359
I think it'll be quicker for me to talk.

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:23.695
I think he came
to get some closure with me.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:28.784
As you can see, he's a man of gestures.

00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:31.036
-He tripped himself.
-Song Ha-gyeong.

00:47:34.748 --> 00:47:36.124
Whose side are you on?

00:47:36.708 --> 00:47:38.794
Don't do me like that.

00:47:38.877 --> 00:47:41.296
I stayed on your side.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.964
Mr. Jeon, that's enough.

00:47:43.048 --> 00:47:44.424
Hey, Ha-gyeong.

00:47:44.508 --> 00:47:48.053
Why are you doing this?
You said so before.

00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:50.430
You couldn't stand it, wanted it cut.

00:47:50.514 --> 00:47:55.852
You'd always say that when we'd meet,
so I cut down all your trees.

00:47:55.936 --> 00:47:57.562
I told you to cut it out!

00:47:58.438 --> 00:48:00.357
-Stop it.
-For real!

00:48:01.024 --> 00:48:03.527
-Stop talking!
-Hold on, hold on.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:04.820
One second!

00:48:06.905 --> 00:48:08.073
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:48:08.865 --> 00:48:13.745
Do you know how much I spent
to cut down those trees?

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.997
How much, you son of a bitch?

00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:23.171
About 250,000 won…

00:48:23.964 --> 00:48:25.298
Are you okay?

00:48:46.778 --> 00:48:50.031
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:48:57.372 --> 00:48:58.832
Is what he said true?

00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:03.670
Yeah. I told him to cut it.

00:49:06.631 --> 00:49:09.885
Why are you overreacting?
They're just trees.

00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:13.430
They'll be nothing when the house is sold.

00:49:14.473 --> 00:49:15.432
You mean that?

00:49:16.767 --> 00:49:18.477
Can selling the house erase…

00:49:19.644 --> 00:49:21.146
17 years of our memories?

00:49:23.565 --> 00:49:27.611
Memories? What are we, children?

00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:31.072
We have bills,
you're talking about memories?

00:49:34.868 --> 00:49:36.912
Because we kissed there one time?

00:49:38.497 --> 00:49:40.540
Then, my ex and I would kiss

00:49:40.624 --> 00:49:42.417
every time at the bus stop.

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:45.420
And the ex before that, at the beach.

00:49:45.504 --> 00:49:47.339
Are those all memories?

00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:50.842
If your heart races every time,
how do you live?

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:54.596
Don't force your memories on me.

00:49:56.014 --> 00:49:58.391
You were here 21 days out of the year.

00:49:59.935 --> 00:50:01.686
You stayed briefly in summer.

00:50:04.147 --> 00:50:06.191
Who are you to say anything to me?

00:50:11.571 --> 00:50:14.199
Your words can have a lot interpretations.

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:15.909
So what?

00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:19.955
Were you disappointed?
Are you saying you felt hurt?

00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:22.749
You want me to stay longer?

00:50:37.639 --> 00:50:38.473
Hey.

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.893
You just come briefly on vacation,
then leave.

00:50:41.977 --> 00:50:44.771
You may think this place
is your vacation home.

00:50:44.855 --> 00:50:46.189
But for me…

00:50:47.482 --> 00:50:48.817
it's terrible.

00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:52.696
There's so much stuff in every corner.

00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:58.743
This space is huge.
It's like a condensed version of my life.

00:50:59.536 --> 00:51:01.162
I'm so sick of it!

00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:06.251
If you don't leave, I will.

00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:56.384
PET EXCLUSIVE TAXI
RUFF RIDE

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.033
What in the world is going on?

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:24.537
If you'd explain the context first,
I'd appreciate it as the owner.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.333
Drink more.

00:52:30.502 --> 00:52:33.004
Su-bak!

00:52:33.088 --> 00:52:35.632
Why did you come out?

00:52:42.347 --> 00:52:43.682
It's scary, right?

00:52:47.978 --> 00:52:51.648
Heavy rain advisory is issued
for the entire metropolitan area.

00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:53.900
Particularly in Patan of Pacheon,

00:52:53.984 --> 00:52:57.278
a rate of 100 ml per hour
of heavy rain is anticipated.

00:52:57.362 --> 00:52:58.822
Hence the warning.

00:53:00.156 --> 00:53:05.870
Due to the sudden heavy downpours,
there's a risk of flooding and landslides,

00:53:05.954 --> 00:53:09.624
so nearby residents
should evacuate to a safe area.

00:53:30.311 --> 00:53:31.730
I don't know.

00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:35.442
I think something happened with Baek Do.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:40.238
Seung-taek, talk to Baek Do
and call me back.

00:53:41.364 --> 00:53:44.909
I'll find out what happened
from Ha-gyeong.

00:53:45.994 --> 00:53:47.037
Song?

00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:50.123
Wanna have a beer?

00:53:53.585 --> 00:53:55.211
Where did she go?

00:54:51.976 --> 00:54:53.019
No.

00:56:25.653 --> 00:56:27.363
I called it a stupid memory.

00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:32.911
So this is how I'll die?

00:56:56.684 --> 00:56:57.685
Song Ha-gyeong!

00:57:24.837 --> 00:57:25.964
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:57:27.298 --> 00:57:29.050
Are you okay? Feeling better?

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.939
The box. What about the box?

00:57:44.732 --> 00:57:45.817
Why do you…

00:57:50.405 --> 00:57:51.447
Move.

00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:09.048
Got a death wish?

00:58:10.675 --> 00:58:13.803
What is it?

00:58:15.513 --> 00:58:19.267
You said those are useless.
You said you were sick of it.

00:58:23.313 --> 00:58:25.106
You risked your life for that?

00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:28.860
BAEK DO-YOUNG

00:58:32.697 --> 00:58:35.116
We have a box

00:58:37.076 --> 00:58:38.745
that should never be opened.

00:58:40.496 --> 00:58:43.041
Especially not for Ha-gyeong.

00:58:48.463 --> 00:58:50.006
I knew it.

00:58:53.134 --> 00:58:55.303
I knew it the second you showed up.

00:59:00.099 --> 00:59:02.143
This happens every time I see you.

00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:05.271
I'm barely holding it together.

00:59:05.355 --> 00:59:08.024
I'm barely holding it in, but every time…

00:59:08.107 --> 00:59:09.150
Every time what?

00:59:15.448 --> 00:59:17.367
We end up a mess like this.

00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:27.043
We really need to end this.

00:59:29.003 --> 00:59:31.047
Let's get out of each other's life.

00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:41.808
You said that two years ago.

00:59:50.441 --> 00:59:51.818
Go ahead, say the rest.

00:59:56.364 --> 00:59:57.448
Sure.

00:59:58.282 --> 00:59:59.867
You and me…

00:59:59.951 --> 01:00:03.454
when I think it can't get any worse,
it gets worse.

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:07.792
I'm scared of how much worse
it could become.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.508
I won't sell the house.

01:00:16.592 --> 01:00:18.010
So you should stop too.

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:21.097
Don't come back.

01:00:24.183 --> 01:00:27.311
Let's not be involved
with each other for good.

01:00:28.646 --> 01:00:29.772
So…

01:00:32.233 --> 01:00:33.276
get lost.

01:00:38.322 --> 01:00:39.365
Fine.

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:42.618
I'll get out of your life.

01:00:44.787 --> 01:00:46.539
Just like you want, for good.

01:00:47.999 --> 01:00:49.250
I'll never come back.

01:00:51.836 --> 01:00:53.421
I'll disappear for good.

01:00:58.676 --> 01:00:59.927
I would've said that…

01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:03.514
ten years ago.

01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:06.476
And…

01:01:09.228 --> 01:01:10.605
two years ago as well.

01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:15.485
But not anymore.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.696
I won't listen to you.

01:01:21.157 --> 01:01:22.450
Song Ha-gyeong.

01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:25.119
Do you know why I came back?

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.958
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

01:01:35.254 --> 01:01:36.631
That's why I came back.

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:40.301
I'm not leaving.

01:01:41.803 --> 01:01:43.179
I won't get lost.

01:01:48.392 --> 01:01:49.602
I know.

01:01:50.978 --> 01:01:53.064
For us to face the summer together,

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.359
we'll have to open that box.

01:01:58.611 --> 01:02:01.447
I came back this summer

01:02:02.865 --> 01:02:04.742
to open the box.

01:02:18.923 --> 01:02:22.969
BAEK DO-YOUNG

01:02:34.856 --> 01:02:36.983
Mr. Baek, so what's your next plan?

01:02:37.066 --> 01:02:40.570
It's renovating the abandoned school
into an observatory.

01:02:40.653 --> 01:02:42.113
The architect's from New York.

01:02:42.697 --> 01:02:44.240
What are you doing here?

01:02:44.323 --> 01:02:46.200
-You really won't get lost?
-Ha-gyeong.

01:02:46.868 --> 01:02:48.828
-You like Mr. Baek that much?
-I do.

01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:50.037
If you confess

01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:51.956
under the Summer Triangle

01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:54.458
on July 7th, you'll never break up.

01:02:54.542 --> 01:02:58.504
Why do you keep appearing before me
when I want to forget you?

01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:02.174
-Hate me all you want, by my side.
-Hey!

01:03:02.258 --> 01:03:04.886
I'm going to like you all summer long.

01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:08.014
Are you really gonna live here with me?

01:03:08.097 --> 01:03:11.392
Who do you think you are?
What gives you the right?

01:03:11.475 --> 01:03:13.769
If anyone has the right, it's not you.
