Dear Your Honor.

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:54.075
Hello.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.620
I'm Song Ha-gyeong, plaintiff
in the co-owned property case.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.336
Your Honor,
how familiar are you with Pacheon?

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.798
You may not be familiar with it at all.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:12.260
I haven't met anyone in the legal field
who lives here.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.345
Maybe because we're near the DMZ.

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:16.306
Hey, Dr. Song.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:18.516
-Good morning.
-Have a good day.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:36.951
People believe Pacheon

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:40.330
would be the first place to be hit
if a war ever started.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:44.334
But for me,
every single day already feels like a war.

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.837
Son of a… 18.

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.214
I'm not cursing.

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:52.175
I should probably introduce Bus 18.

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:56.846
The bus comes every 40 minutes,
stops at five villages, and has 18 seats.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.273
Back when I was 18, 11 years ago,
it was even worse.

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:09.484
Hey, the bus is here!

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:14.239
It only came every 80 minutes
and made stops in ten villages.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:17.200
Sir! Sir!

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:21.579
I had to throw myself onto the road
just to catch the bus.

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm sorry.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.333
Come on, get on.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:29.045
The place where I had to risk my life
every day just to get to school

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:31.339
is Pacheon's northernmost point,

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:32.632
Patan.

00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:34.175
Let's get on.

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:42.058
For the past 17 years, Patan…

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:44.602
has slowly…

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:50.650
shaped me into
a pretty wrecked human being.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.402
Say something.

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:55.113
Get lost.

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.200
Let's not see each other again.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.371
I really hate Patan.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:05.373
PATAN WHERE YOUTH ARE HAPPY!

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.919
If you help me
get out of this miserable village,

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:11.838
I'll never cause any trouble

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.590
or file any complaints.
I'll live quietly from now on.

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:16.384
Your Honor.

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:21.222
Please have some compassion
for this wrecked soul.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.790
Oh, Patan

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:53.254
You've truly ignored me, Patan

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:56.549
We have no bribes to give
So we cannot reach you

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:57.675
NO BUS ROUTE CHANGE!

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.469
ADMINISTRATIVE MESS

00:03:59.552 --> 00:04:02.013
Oh, Patan

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.224
Patan's administration is wrecked,
wake up!

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:06.142
Wake up!

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.102
GO, PATAN!
STRONG AS EVER

00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.105
26TH PACHEON SOYBEAN FESTIVAL

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.610
Good morning, sir.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.532
TOWN REVITALIZATION TEAM
SONG HA-GYEONG

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:26.287
You've truly ignored me, Patan
We have no bribes to give

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:28.373
EXPENSE FORM
SCREEN SAVER PASSWORD

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.338
Oh, Patan

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:37.882
-Hey, Ms. Song.
-Yeah?

00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:41.552
That elder leader
was your dad's classmate, right?

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:46.182
To be precise,
the seniors' association secretary

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:48.559
went to school with my dad's cousin.

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:54.399
Perfect. Go calm them down.
It's so loud, I can't get anything done.

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:57.068
Use your own school connections.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.362
-Isn't he your senior too?
-Oh, man!

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.910
I should be able to handle it
after 2:00 p.m.

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:09.580
You told me to submit this
by 2:00 p.m. today.

00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:13.960
But at exactly 2:00 p.m.,
a reporter from Domin Ilbo is coming.

00:05:14.043 --> 00:05:16.003
What's more urgent, the report or that?

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:22.385
So… if I get them to leave by 2:00 p.m.,

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:24.720
what would you do for me?

00:05:25.388 --> 00:05:27.306
So, it's another deal, huh?

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.350
So noisy.

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:31.686
Okay. Anything you want.

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:34.063
Deal.

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:36.524
Listen! Listen!

00:05:40.987 --> 00:05:44.365
Wait. We called for the chief.
Why are you here?

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:47.285
-Pass it to them.
-Okay.

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:51.873
Everyone, take one each.
Please pass them around.

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:53.666
Share it together.

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:54.876
FILING A COMPLAINT

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.379
If you're near-sighted,
check the handouts.

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:02.717
If you're far-sighted,
please look at the board.

00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.803
Just follow these steps. Step one.

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:09.348
Search "Pacheon City Hall"
in your browser.

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:10.433
Step two.

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:14.145
Go to the Pacheon City Hall website.
Step three.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.149
Select the "Civil Services" menu
on the top left.

00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:23.321
Step four. Click "Write" at
the bottom right and lastly step five.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:27.533
Fill out your complaint,
then click "submit" at the bottom.

00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:28.618
Do you understand?

00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:32.496
Wait. What if the township head
deletes everything?

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:36.167
You must think we know nothing
about the Internet.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.128
This goes straight to City Hall,
so he has no control.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.131
The mayor, who is higher, will see it.

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:44.926
The mayor outranks the township head.

00:06:46.344 --> 00:06:48.554
Is the mayor going to punish them
for this?

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.600
Look at you all dressed up today.

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:56.312
And from the tile-roofed house.

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:57.855
Hello, Baduk Director.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.316
Stone-fence house elder,
the crab place owner.

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:04.487
And Mr. Song, who went to middle school
with my distant uncle.

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:07.615
I've lived in this town for 17 years.

00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.701
Who do you think put up that streetlight?

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:14.413
I did, in seventh grade.

00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:16.874
Who bundled up that tree for the winter?

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:21.754
I did, when I was in eighth grade.

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:25.424
All of this was accomplished
by filing complaints myself.

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:29.262
I'm sure you can make it happen too.

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.430
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:35.101
All right, shall we go eat now?

00:07:35.184 --> 00:07:38.646
Let's go, we need it
to wring the township head's neck.

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.481
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.858
The restaurant is that way.

00:07:49.782 --> 00:07:51.867
She's an ace, through and through.

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:55.288
They call her "Dr. Song of Patan"
for a reason.

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:57.456
Ha-gyeong, join our team.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:01.210
Please, take her already.

00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:04.463
In our town,
we don't need a smart ace.

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:06.382
What we need is someone

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:09.552
who just does their job
without causing trouble.

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:12.305
Still, you know…

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:14.307
the fence removal project?

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:18.894
-It's down to the final presentation.
-Right.

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:22.857
When did she manage
to submit that application so cleverly?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.360
It needs over 400 million won in funding.

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:28.154
Would City Hall even approve it?

00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:30.156
If you manage to land the project--

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:31.532
If I do…

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:34.619
you'll definitely back me up this time.

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.794
It's almost lunchtime.
Let's head out for lunch.

00:08:43.878 --> 00:08:45.630
It's on me.

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:48.090
-How about kimchi stew?
-Sounds good.

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:50.843
Don't you know
Ms. Song never eats out in Patan?

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:52.178
This isn't new.

00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:54.847
Enjoy your meal.

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:56.432
I feel sick.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.021
HAPPY REAL ESTATE

00:09:02.772 --> 00:09:03.689
Hello?

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:05.900
The air's so clean, right?

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.819
You couldn't be luckier.

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:13.324
Right next to this house is a stream,
and Mount Patan is right behind.

00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:16.661
Perfect for staying healthy.
Three generations together?

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.747
-Yes.
-This house is perfect for you.

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:22.375
You'll know the second you see it.

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.378
Just in time. The owner's here.

00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:28.130
-Dr. Song.
-Hi.

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:32.551
Our Dr. Song is the number one
civil servant in our town.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.679
Grade 7 official.

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:37.556
She's young, owns a house,
and is really sharp.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:40.643
-Let's head inside.
-Let's head inside.

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:46.148
-Come on in.
-So big.

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.360
-Right?
-Yes.

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.572
Come on in.

00:09:54.657 --> 00:09:56.826
It's nice, isn't it?

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:01.539
It's south-facing,
so it gets plenty of sunlight.

00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:05.251
It's built with wood,
and it's well-insulated. Take a look.

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:08.629
The interior's finished really nicely.

00:10:08.713 --> 00:10:10.339
It really is.

00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:12.633
The interior is really stylish.

00:10:13.217 --> 00:10:15.136
Even though it's old, it's neat.

00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:20.433
My parents did these themselves,
so they won't fall or break.

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:21.684
I see.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.063
My father was an architect,
so he was really handy.

00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:29.150
Next door, Mr. Baek, is also an architect.

00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:33.738
They're friends, so they built
this fun house to share happy memories.

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:36.824
How long have you lived here?

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:38.576
-About 17 years.
-I see.

00:10:39.243 --> 00:10:41.162
How many people are living here now?

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:47.835
Right now, it's just me,
but ten people used to live here.

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:49.503
There's plenty of space.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.510
Whose dog is this?

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:00.681
-Take a look.
-This is nice too.

00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:04.101
Where are we?

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:06.228
-So cute.
-Isn't it nice?

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:07.938
-What's his name?
-Su-bak.

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:11.192
-Hi, Su-bak.
-Hi, Su-bak, you're so cute.

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:15.529
So, this place can be accessed
from both doors,

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:18.532
from this house and that house?

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:19.617
That's right.

00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:23.204
It'd make a great spot
for hanging out and talking.

00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:25.247
Who made this?

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.126
Sorry, you can't touch this.

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:35.007
You want to check the rest?
I don't have much time.

00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:37.510
Please come in.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.764
Let's come inside.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:44.016
Come in.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.523
Great study room for the kids.
The walls are packed with bookshelves.

00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:54.068
But this wall seems too thin.

00:11:54.151 --> 00:11:55.152
Is that so?

00:11:56.445 --> 00:12:01.242
It's thin since it's drywall,
but the insulation is fine.

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:02.743
Heating's no problem.

00:12:03.536 --> 00:12:05.871
What is this?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.543
What's this hole?

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:13.671
Here too.

00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:20.844
Mr. Baek's son I mentioned earlier
lived next door since childhood.

00:12:20.928 --> 00:12:23.806
The hole must be from
when they were bickering.

00:12:24.723 --> 00:12:31.188
It was so rowdy. The whole neighborhood
could hear the racket they made.

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:34.233
May I ask you something?

00:12:36.902 --> 00:12:39.863
Are you thinking about any repairs
or renovations?

00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:46.036
No, it has everything it needs.
I'd like to live here as it is.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.162
Right.

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:49.873
You intend to live here, right?

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:53.669
You won't turn it into a rental
or a second home?

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:57.631
No, we're looking for a house
our family can live in long-term.

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:00.467
I see.

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:02.261
VISIT LIST
ACTUAL RESIDENCE

00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:04.471
-Get back soon. Thank you.
-Sure.

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:06.557
Don't wait too long, or it will be taken.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.476
Bye.

00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:16.567
It's empty next door. I told you
to hand me the key if you're busy.

00:13:17.818 --> 00:13:19.653
NOTHING UNUSUAL, THE BEST FIT

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:21.947
Who's supposed to be happy with whom?

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.409
-Things sorted out with Mr. Baek?
-Of course.

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:27.494
THEY'LL DECIDE IN THREE DAYS

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:28.662
HOUSE VISIT LIST

00:13:57.107 --> 00:14:00.736
Do-ha, you're not going to
let her sell the house, are you?

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:05.032
What's your next move?

00:14:06.992 --> 00:14:09.662
You wouldn't have come back
without a plan.

00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:19.755
PACHEON CITY HALL

00:14:19.838 --> 00:14:22.257
On the left is Patan town,

00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:26.136
on the right is Taehwa city.
Do you see the difference?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.263
-No fence?
-That's correct.

00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:30.349
On the right, there's no fence.

00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:31.517
Taehwa city

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.479
tore down the fences, creating green space
the size of 55 soccer fields.

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:38.816
They fixed parking issues,
improving alleys,

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:40.818
revitalizing local businesses.

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:43.278
If we remove the fences in Patan,

00:14:43.362 --> 00:14:46.740
we could fix parking problems
and boost the local economy.

00:14:47.658 --> 00:14:48.826
I'll take questions.

00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:50.619
As Traffic Department,

00:14:50.703 --> 00:14:54.999
if parking is the issue,
a different solution might be better.

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.669
As you know,
Patan isn't allowed a parking tower

00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:00.629
as it would ruin the scenery.

00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:03.132
Also, removing the fence costs less

00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:06.468
than building a parking tower,
so it's more efficient.

00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:09.471
Speaking of budget,
this costs 400 million won.

00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:13.058
Isn't it too big a project
for the office to manage?

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:17.187
It might be a big project for the office,

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:22.234
but not for me.
It's the smallest one I've ever handled.

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:27.322
As you know,
Yeonjin had to stop their fence project

00:15:27.406 --> 00:15:31.618
because they couldn't
get the residents to agree.

00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:36.290
Even if the fence is public,
the land's private, right?

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:41.462
Thank you for the question I expected,
Ms. Jeon from Architecture.

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:46.425
I'll get all the residents' consent
within a week.

00:15:51.513 --> 00:15:52.639
It's not that hard.

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:57.102
I managed this all the time
when I worked at the city office.

00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:03.025
-Yes?
-Why do you want this project?

00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:07.071
I've…

00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:12.034
lived in Patan for 17 years.
I've wanted to fix this.

00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:15.454
I've filed complaints for 17 years,

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:17.206
but nothing's been done.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:21.919
I've had enough,
so I'm going to make a change.

00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:28.342
It's right before the reshuffle,
no one's going to help. Can you manage?

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.135
Yes, I can.

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:33.847
That settles it.
I'll give the final approval.

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:40.813
-Was it Officer Song Ha-gyeong?
-Yes, that's right.

00:16:41.438 --> 00:16:44.441
I've got high hopes.
See you at the office again.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:46.235
Thank you.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.991
Yes!

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:54.785
Yeah.

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:58.413
Really? They're accepting all conditions?

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:02.918
Sounds great. I'm on my way now.

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:06.004
REAL ESTATE

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:10.134
-Hi.
-Come on in.

00:17:10.217 --> 00:17:12.136
Dr. Song, come over here.

00:17:13.053 --> 00:17:14.471
Just a second.

00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:18.183
I thought your talk
with Mr. Baek went well.

00:17:18.725 --> 00:17:22.271
It did, he gave me full authority
over all the sales. Why?

00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:24.940
Did you get Mr. Baek's seal?

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:29.570
Sure, I've got the power of attorney,
the seal, and seal certificate.

00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:33.282
-Let me see.
-The power of attorney.

00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:34.408
The seal certificate.

00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:40.539
Baek Gi-ho,
that's Mr. Baek's full name, right?

00:17:41.248 --> 00:17:43.250
-Baek Gi-ho?
-That's right, Baek Gi-ho.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.594
CO-OWNER
BAEK DO-HA

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:57.598
Baek Do-ha?

00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:01.351
Mr. Baek, what's going on?
Do-ha's in Seoul now?

00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:02.978
Since when?

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.148
No, that's not important.

00:18:06.815 --> 00:18:09.484
You put me in charge for the sale.

00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:11.653
Why is it suddenly under Do-ha?

00:18:11.737 --> 00:18:17.284
He asked for a birthday gift and wanted
the ownership changed. How could I say no?

00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:19.369
A gift?

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:22.831
He pestered me to buy him that ash tree.

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:26.418
That was the only thing.
He's never asked for anything.

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.046
How could I say no when he did?

00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:30.130
Mr. Baek!

00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:36.178
Mr. Choi, don't forget your safety helmet.

00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:39.932
Ha-gyeong, I'm a little busy.
Call Do-ha. We'll talk later.

00:18:40.474 --> 00:18:41.433
Hello? Mr. Baek?

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:48.273
Yeah, right.

00:18:48.857 --> 00:18:50.651
No wonder it was easy.

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.907
For a moment, I forgot

00:18:57.658 --> 00:19:01.662
that my summers
are always ridiculously unlucky.

00:19:04.665 --> 00:19:06.500
CO-OWNER
BAEK DO-HA, HALF SHARE

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:15.425
Do-ha hasn't changed his number.

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:18.845
He always does what you say.
Call him.

00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:21.223
BAEK DO-HA

00:19:30.357 --> 00:19:33.068
It's been so uneventful,
I'd completely forgotten

00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:37.489
this miserable, brutal summer.

00:19:37.572 --> 00:19:39.283
17 YEARS AGO

00:19:39.366 --> 00:19:44.162
Right, that's when it started. In June,
I suddenly broke out in hives all over.

00:19:44.246 --> 00:19:46.290
-Did you find out?
-A peanut allergy.

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:51.962
I thought it was food poisoning,
but it turned out to be a peanut allergy.

00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:55.424
We should go somewhere once you're better.

00:19:55.507 --> 00:20:00.762
I started living in this insane place,
where it hit 37°C from early June,

00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:03.265
when I was 12. It was summer.

00:20:03.348 --> 00:20:04.975
-Peanut house?
-Yeah.

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:09.855
Didn't you hear I have a peanut allergy?

00:20:11.023 --> 00:20:14.318
Peanut house, where two become one.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.115
Isn't that adorable? It's meaningful.
So you'll be living with…

00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:28.915
Ever since then,
my streak of bad luck

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.126
has been unbelievable.

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:33.211
4 YEARS AGO

00:20:33.295 --> 00:20:36.006
Come on, save me here.

00:20:37.007 --> 00:20:38.550
Listen while I'm being nice!

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:41.053
So hot.

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:44.222
3 YEARS AGO

00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:52.731
Are you okay?

00:20:52.814 --> 00:20:53.940
2 YEARS AGO

00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:58.487
Why?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.451
A YEAR AGO

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.579
JANGDAN SOYBEAN MEJU

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.306
Meeting a buyer who agrees to everything,
that's pure luck.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.018
You've been hoping to leave.
Are you going to pass this up?

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:38.902
Hey, I heard you're back in Korea.

00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:41.988
DAEGUK BANK

00:21:44.366 --> 00:21:45.951
Hey.

00:21:50.705 --> 00:21:51.873
Dang it.

00:21:52.582 --> 00:21:53.583
What is it?

00:21:56.837 --> 00:21:58.839
Baek Do-ha sent 500,000 won.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.637
I went to the market,
and they already have pigweed.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.099
I made it while chatting with Ha-gyeong,
and it's salty.

00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:11.518
Still, Grandpa,

00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:14.521
just take one bite
and two spoonfuls of rice.

00:22:14.604 --> 00:22:17.023
Jeong Kyung-tae, this year he's 63.

00:22:17.732 --> 00:22:19.985
His hands may be clumsy, but…

00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:24.156
This time, I brought black rice,
mixed grain rice,

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:27.325
and even gondeure rice.

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:32.038
I brought a ton of things you like.
Heat them up and enjoy.

00:22:39.796 --> 00:22:42.507
I'm sweating trying to talk to you.

00:22:42.591 --> 00:22:44.885
Really? You'll keep ignoring me?

00:22:51.516 --> 00:22:53.852
Isn't my grandpa too dramatic?

00:22:53.935 --> 00:22:56.688
It's not like
I did something unforgivable.

00:22:56.771 --> 00:23:01.193
He's almost 80, but sometimes,
he acts like a moody teenager.

00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:05.030
He cut ties
with his best friend of 60 years.

00:23:05.113 --> 00:23:07.991
Ignoring me for five years
would be nothing.

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:10.035
Song, you know what I'm good at.

00:23:10.118 --> 00:23:12.204
I don't give up.

00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:21.254
Darn it, you talk now.
I want to eat something.

00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:24.507
I've been rambling,
trying to get you to open up

00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:26.635
for the whole 30 minutes.

00:23:26.718 --> 00:23:29.846
This isn't small talk anymore.
Say something already.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.598
What's with the suspense?

00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:35.644
Hey. The ingredients are really fresh.
It's good. Go on, eat.

00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:39.773
I'm past being surprised by your life.

00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:43.151
I wasn't shocked when you got fired,

00:23:43.235 --> 00:23:47.322
or when you went wild with
that sleek city hall guy two years back.

00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:49.449
-I wasn't surprised--
-I contacted Do-ha.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.748
He's been back in Korea for months.

00:23:59.709 --> 00:24:01.419
I'm sure you knew.

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:05.382
There's no way
Seung-taek wouldn't meet him.

00:24:05.465 --> 00:24:07.676
Well… Yeah…

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.136
Baek Do did come to Seoul.

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:15.058
Baek Do? Baek… You're really sweet.

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:18.603
You've secretly been keeping in touch?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.026
Hey! I've only seen him a few times
in Seoul because of Seung-taek.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.822
Of course. You'd stay close to Seung-taek.

00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:31.992
What, you three got together

00:24:32.075 --> 00:24:34.452
and bonded over gossiping about me?

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:37.914
We didn't talk behind your back.

00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:40.583
Forget it. Tell me everything.

00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:43.962
When did he come back?

00:24:44.671 --> 00:24:46.840
He's taken over his dad's atelier.

00:24:46.923 --> 00:24:49.843
He really is something,
he's not 30 yet.

00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:54.806
You know the Seongsu Museum
from that article? He designed that.

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:58.893
He was on a whole different level.

00:25:03.732 --> 00:25:05.900
It's not that I'm proud of Baek Do.

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:08.278
I just heard from Seung-taek.

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:10.989
Sometimes I see the familiar face
in the news.

00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:14.492
Hey, let's be real. Baek Do's killing it.

00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:18.204
Last year, in Korea,
he won the architecture award.

00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:21.666
This year for the Pritzker Prize,
architecture's Nobel?

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:25.628
Why did that big shot come back?

00:25:26.338 --> 00:25:29.632
It's summer.
Summer basically means Baek Do-ha.

00:25:30.342 --> 00:25:33.511
By the way, he has no feelings for you.

00:25:34.763 --> 00:25:37.974
You're the one
who hates even hearing his name.

00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:39.601
He never talks about you.

00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:43.063
Really?

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:44.939
Yeah.

00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:47.650
-He doesn't seem to have feelings?
-Yeah.

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:50.945
Then why is there no reply from him?

00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:54.783
I sent something
he was supposed to respond to.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:57.660
What did you send?

00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:06.628
That stubborn Song
got in touch with Do-ha at last.

00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:10.215
When she said two years ago
that she was done with Do-ha,

00:26:10.298 --> 00:26:12.384
I didn't expect she'd see him.

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:16.054
What do you think she said to him?
I'm dying to know.

00:26:16.596 --> 00:26:18.556
Send the money first.

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:20.934
Did you forget our bet?

00:26:21.017 --> 00:26:23.728
Who's going to reach out,
Ha-gyeong or Do-ha?

00:26:25.772 --> 00:26:27.690
She always makes my life harder.

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:32.070
I sent you 100,000 won.

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:34.614
Wait, why only 100,000 won?
Should be double.

00:26:34.697 --> 00:26:40.203
Seung-taek, the stocks are down by half,
I sent it taking that into account.

00:26:41.287 --> 00:26:43.498
I'm smart, right?

00:26:45.166 --> 00:26:48.002
I'm worried. I have this uneasy feeling.

00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:52.715
Did Baek Do say anything to you?

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:56.386
He came back to Korea
because of Song, right?

00:26:56.469 --> 00:26:58.263
You know something, don't you?

00:27:01.641 --> 00:27:04.018
Having trouble sleeping tonight?

00:27:04.978 --> 00:27:06.646
Do you know why?

00:27:07.355 --> 00:27:10.024
It's because your brain is still at work.

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:14.070
So how does the brain work?

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:19.784
It stores memories by using your senses.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.581
Smells, textures, sounds,

00:27:25.582 --> 00:27:26.749
those powerful memories

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:30.253
leave deep traces in our minds.

00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:35.675
To help you forget memories,
we've got ASMR to help you sleep.

00:27:35.758 --> 00:27:40.722
Cicadas chirping, it's noisy, it's so hot.

00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:44.267
It's annoying, I get annoyed by Baek Do…

00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:55.653
Why can't these mosquitoes just disappear?

00:27:56.946 --> 00:27:59.991
Right, I still have that storm warning
to deal with.

00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:05.079
Stupid monsoon. I'm on duty tomorrow.

00:28:06.706 --> 00:28:10.835
When will summer end?
Why did Do-ha come back?

00:28:12.128 --> 00:28:13.546
What's with memories?

00:28:18.343 --> 00:28:19.969
This jerk hasn't responded.

00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:24.057
Why Baek Do-ha again?

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:23.408
BAEK DO-HA JUST SENT AN EMAIL

00:29:33.585 --> 00:29:36.796
Meet at Star Cafe on June 5th at 7:00 p.m.

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:32.602
-You're Baek Do-ha's lawyer?
-I'm Seo Su-hyeok.

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:36.648
-Were you disappointed that I came?
-No, not at all.

00:30:37.523 --> 00:30:40.443
I was just surprised.
I wasn't expecting his lawyer.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:43.988
If you didn't want to see a lawyer,

00:30:44.072 --> 00:30:46.324
why'd you send three notices in a week?

00:30:46.407 --> 00:30:49.744
Including scary lines like,
"I'll enforce this by law"

00:30:49.827 --> 00:30:51.829
and "I'll sue for emotional damages."

00:30:55.124 --> 00:30:57.919
On second thought, it might be easier.

00:30:58.628 --> 00:31:02.966
As you saw in the documents,
I handled everything according to the law.

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:06.219
With the power of attorney
I tried to sell the house,

00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:09.889
but your client interfered illegally,
on the closing day.

00:31:10.932 --> 00:31:14.143
It's caused me serious time
and financial losses.

00:31:14.227 --> 00:31:18.481
I intend to act on everything
I mentioned in the notices.

00:31:18.564 --> 00:31:21.734
I can't keep the buyers
waiting any longer. Bye.

00:31:23.695 --> 00:31:27.323
Did you check the property records
on the day of the deal?

00:31:28.658 --> 00:31:33.037
With a contract of this size,
you should have been more prepared.

00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:36.916
You were a little underprepared.

00:31:39.293 --> 00:31:42.839
Who actually checks the property records
every day?

00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:47.218
If you did check,
you would've prevented such huge damage.

00:31:49.012 --> 00:31:52.765
For now, I'll relay it that way.
Anything else?

00:31:58.813 --> 00:32:01.024
I took out my favorite hammer drill.

00:32:03.943 --> 00:32:05.570
He'll know what it means.

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:08.656
It's a limited model
he's been wanting for a while.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.533
I'm going to use it today.

00:32:11.993 --> 00:32:16.039
Also, tell him that the bench press
and hockey sticks will be sold.

00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:18.249
There's not enough space.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.048
And tell him to send more
for child support.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.719
-He'll know what it means.
-Did you two have kids?

00:32:31.512 --> 00:32:33.222
Not just the kids.

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:36.059
That's what she said.

00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:37.643
CLIENT BAEK DO-HA

00:32:38.978 --> 00:32:41.272
Hello? Mr. Baek? Can you hear me?

00:32:43.232 --> 00:32:45.109
Yes, I'm listening.

00:32:45.818 --> 00:32:48.237
I'd better go before she makes holes.

00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:49.906
She does what she says.

00:32:50.531 --> 00:32:52.241
-On top of that--
-After that…

00:32:56.037 --> 00:33:00.166
I guess she said she'd sell all my stuff,
like the hockey sticks.

00:33:00.249 --> 00:33:02.502
Yes, that's exactly what she said.

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:07.006
She told you to send an extra 200,000 won
for child support.

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:09.675
She really hasn't changed.

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:12.095
All right, I'll call you back later.

00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:23.314
PATAN,
WHERE PEOPLE AND NATURE COME TOGETHER

00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:26.901
Where are you going?

00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:28.528
-To the community center.
-Why?

00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:31.447
Everyone's gathered there
to sign the consent forms.

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:34.867
That's what you're handling on your own.

00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:38.037
Shouldn't our work come first?

00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:40.540
Let's go catch some visitors.

00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:48.256
Why isn't it coming out?

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:53.719
Oh, no! My eyes!

00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:07.775
Way to go.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:11.362
Mom!

00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:17.702
Mom, Dad! What do I do?

00:34:17.785 --> 00:34:20.580
Just go home. Get off work.

00:34:29.255 --> 00:34:31.549
I really want to go home.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.311
So noisy.

00:34:47.982 --> 00:34:49.025
What?

00:34:54.197 --> 00:34:55.448
Su-bak.

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:00.328
I'm home, Su-bak.

00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:04.207
SU-BAK

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:07.710
Song Su-bak!

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:26.437
Su-bak?

00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:41.786
-Hello?
-Seul, did you come to my place?

00:35:41.869 --> 00:35:43.829
-Su-bak's not here.
-No.

00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:45.539
Did you look everywhere?

00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:50.795
-Oh, no. Should we go look together?
-Let me hang up.

00:35:50.878 --> 00:35:52.129
Su-bak!

00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:00.137
Su-bak!

00:36:01.347 --> 00:36:04.558
-Ma'am, did you see Su-bak?
-No, what's going on?

00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:06.018
I don't know. He's missing.

00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:08.104
Su-bak!

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:09.772
Su-bak!

00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:12.942
Song Su-bak!

00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:17.655
Su-bak!

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:20.616
Su-bak.

00:37:35.691 --> 00:37:36.734
Hey, Su-bak.

00:37:43.032 --> 00:37:45.242
-Did you get a pay cut again?
-What?

00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:49.622
I've been sending child support
every month, why's Su-bak so skinny?

00:37:57.129 --> 00:37:58.130
Hey, Song Su-bak!

00:37:58.214 --> 00:38:00.508
As always, stupid summer is no luck.

00:38:12.478 --> 00:38:13.687
Come here.

00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:17.358
Hey, you…

00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:50.266
Here's a treat.

00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:56.856
I'll give you two.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.608
Let's go.

00:39:20.254 --> 00:39:21.797
Seriously.

00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:25.176
There's no treat. I tricked you.

00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:29.096
We're even now. You betrayed me. Foot up.

00:39:31.098 --> 00:39:34.018
Why did you follow him?
You should've bitten him.

00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:35.811
You traitor.

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:44.612
I can't believe you. Hey!

00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:48.324
-Hey!
-Good boy.

00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:49.825
Come here, Su-bak!

00:39:55.998 --> 00:40:00.294
Hey, if you make it so obvious,
someone's going to get jealous.

00:40:00.377 --> 00:40:02.671
Don't you know your mom holds grudges?

00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:06.717
Ha-gyeong.

00:40:07.927 --> 00:40:12.264
Send me the receipts. I've sent
500,000 won each month. What more?

00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:13.349
Hey.

00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:17.144
You know how picky Su-bak is?

00:40:17.228 --> 00:40:19.563
The treat prices keep going up.

00:40:19.647 --> 00:40:23.442
For grooming an old dog,
they charge extra.

00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:25.444
There's an extra fee for an old dog.

00:40:26.695 --> 00:40:30.324
You think you know childcare?
500,000 won isn't enough.

00:40:30.449 --> 00:40:31.659
You wipe his feet.

00:40:33.786 --> 00:40:37.081
Hey, why 500,000 won? What about you?

00:40:37.164 --> 00:40:40.751
I take care of him 24/7.
I walk him two hours daily.

00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:43.837
I buy supplements regularly
and take him to the vet.

00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:46.423
My labor is more than 500,000 won, okay?

00:40:52.638 --> 00:40:53.639
You haven't changed.

00:40:55.641 --> 00:40:56.809
What are you looking at?

00:41:04.775 --> 00:41:05.943
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:09.363
It's been a while.

00:41:11.448 --> 00:41:13.075
It's been two years, right?

00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:17.955
Stop.

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:22.126
I don't feel like making small talk.

00:41:25.379 --> 00:41:28.132
Have a seat.
You came here to say something.

00:41:35.556 --> 00:41:38.434
-You hired a lawyer.
-Someone sent notices.

00:41:38.517 --> 00:41:40.227
Your dad gave me the POA.

00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:41.687
He gave it back to me.

00:41:44.815 --> 00:41:46.609
With your comfy life in the States,

00:41:46.692 --> 00:41:48.569
you have no idea

00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:51.572
how much real estate has changed,
even in Patan.

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:56.619
If we miss this chance,
who knows when it'll sell.

00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:57.995
Maybe it won't sell.

00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:02.791
Three generations under one roof.
They seem nice, I want to sell it.

00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:07.171
So?

00:42:10.924 --> 00:42:11.884
I know you're busy.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.764
Hand me your seal and the consent form,
and I'll handle the rest.

00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:22.019
Why are you so eager to sell?

00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:25.230
You would know the reason best.

00:42:30.736 --> 00:42:34.531
You might not realize it,
but if this doesn't sell now,

00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:37.284
I might be stuck
for five or 10 more years.

00:42:37.368 --> 00:42:39.953
-Aren't you sick of this place?
-No.

00:42:40.037 --> 00:42:41.538
But you never showed up?

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.881
You told me not to.

00:42:52.257 --> 00:42:54.677
You said you'd kill me if I showed up.

00:42:57.179 --> 00:42:58.555
Then why bother coming?

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.645
You're driving me nuts.

00:43:06.897 --> 00:43:09.233
You said you'd drill a hole.

00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:11.694
You know I love that hockey stick,

00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:14.488
and you said you'd sell it.

00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:18.283
I'm so soft-hearted.
I do whatever you tell me.

00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:21.036
If you say so, I leave, then I'm here.

00:43:22.329 --> 00:43:24.623
We haven't changed at all, right?

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:29.420
-You're excited.
-I just got my own place recently.

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:34.591
It's nice that you're actually
talking to me after two years.

00:43:36.885 --> 00:43:39.763
I need to wash up,
I came straight from the site.

00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:41.515
What?

00:43:42.307 --> 00:43:43.350
Hey.

00:43:44.643 --> 00:43:45.769
Hey.

00:43:45.853 --> 00:43:48.397
What gives you the right to shower here?

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.524
Why not? It's my house, I can wash up.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.862
I'm being nice,
either go to Seoul or get out of my face.

00:43:57.406 --> 00:44:00.075
Don't you realize you keep following me?

00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:04.037
-Hey, Baek Do-ha.
-Song Ha-gyeong.

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:11.211
-You started something ridiculous again.
-What?

00:44:11.295 --> 00:44:13.922
I heard you're pushing
for a fence removal project.

00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:15.883
You think that works architecturally?

00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.220
How'd you know? Are you stalking me?

00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:23.015
Hey, everyone's talking about you here.

00:44:23.098 --> 00:44:27.478
Dr. Song, master of complaints, gutsy nut
who crossed the boss and got demoted.

00:44:29.313 --> 00:44:31.523
-Just as I thought, Ha-gyeong.
-Hey.

00:44:33.192 --> 00:44:36.195
You got a death wish?
You really want to get beat up?

00:44:36.278 --> 00:44:39.573
I thought you'd be different.
But just as I expected.

00:44:40.657 --> 00:44:42.242
You said, "Just as I expected"

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:45.621
more than a few times now.
Say it one more time.

00:44:45.704 --> 00:44:47.122
What then?

00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:48.957
You want this to get bloody?

00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:51.168
As if that is new between us.

00:44:53.045 --> 00:44:54.796
You've gotten better at your banter.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.048
Not just that.

00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:57.174
What else?

00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:01.136
Everything you can imagine.

00:45:05.265 --> 00:45:07.434
I'm glad nothing's changed.

00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:11.146
The neighborhood, this house…

00:45:12.648 --> 00:45:14.691
and you, who has been living here.

00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:18.695
I've changed a little.

00:45:20.322 --> 00:45:21.907
Let's get along, Ha-gyeong.

00:45:39.007 --> 00:45:42.010
What was that?
I just got completely beaten, right?

00:45:43.053 --> 00:45:44.846
I nearly got knocked out.

00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:48.433
What happened to him?

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.369
Haven't you changed a bit, you pervert?

00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:50.370
You should put the waterproofing
up to the wall.

00:46:50.454 --> 00:46:53.040
You shouldn't be so sloppy all the time.

00:46:53.123 --> 00:46:57.586
Everyone here's a pro.
This amount is safe for the waterproofing.

00:46:57.669 --> 00:47:01.757
It's burning out here.
When are we supposed to go over the plans?

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.801
What if I draw it?

00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:13.393
Hi there.

00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:17.397
From what I hear,

00:47:17.481 --> 00:47:21.943
if you do the roof waterproofing
that sloppily, it'll ruin the whole layer.

00:47:26.156 --> 00:47:27.032
Floor area.

00:47:30.702 --> 00:47:33.038
150… The protruding part…

00:47:45.175 --> 00:47:47.678
Here, use this as a guide.

00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:53.600
And if you're a pro, you should've been
familiar with all the site plans.

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:56.353
Am I supposed to follow you around
and draw it for you?

00:47:58.105 --> 00:47:59.481
Fine, you punk.

00:48:00.482 --> 00:48:02.859
You know what a pain you are on the job?

00:48:04.444 --> 00:48:06.613
Guys, let's follow this.

00:48:06.697 --> 00:48:09.449
If we don't stick to this,
he'll draw a hundred more.

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:10.909
So scary.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.204
Let's go.

00:48:14.287 --> 00:48:16.998
-You got this.
-You punk.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.921
-When did you come?
-Just now.

00:48:24.965 --> 00:48:29.010
I get more calls from Ha-gyeong
than those loan calls.

00:48:29.845 --> 00:48:33.014
-What will you do about the house?
-I have a plan.

00:48:33.098 --> 00:48:36.768
Are you not going to sell the house?
That's why you wanted the title?

00:48:36.852 --> 00:48:40.355
Without that house,
would she have called me?

00:48:42.274 --> 00:48:44.609
What do I do about you guys?

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.239
By the way, Dad,
did you check out my contest draft?

00:48:49.322 --> 00:48:51.116
-That's why I came today.
-Right.

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:54.995
-What was that? You're really doing that?
-Yeah, I'm trying to.

00:48:55.704 --> 00:48:57.706
As a pro, do you think it'll work?

00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:09.259
This fence-removal project
is a real headache.

00:49:09.342 --> 00:49:12.846
We can get going
once we get the residents' consent forms.

00:49:12.929 --> 00:49:15.265
The problem is the upcoming heavy rain.

00:49:15.348 --> 00:49:18.059
People are all scared of flooding.

00:49:26.193 --> 00:49:27.486
Ms. Song?

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:29.738
Yes.

00:49:31.072 --> 00:49:32.115
All right.

00:49:32.699 --> 00:49:37.162
As you know, the drainage system
was completed two years ago.

00:49:37.245 --> 00:49:40.415
Everything will be fine
unless they alter the dam's discharge.

00:49:40.499 --> 00:49:44.085
Even if we take down the fence,
there won't be flooding.

00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:47.631
How exactly are we supposed
to get the consent forms?

00:49:48.465 --> 00:49:50.717
We'll have to go around door to door.

00:49:55.472 --> 00:49:58.058
Sir, why did you
suddenly change your mind?

00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:01.686
Last time I went over it, you liked it
since the street would be widened.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.189
The rainy season is coming soon.

00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:07.734
The fence stops the flood damage.
Remember three years ago?

00:50:07.818 --> 00:50:10.070
That's not because of the fence.

00:50:10.153 --> 00:50:13.782
If it rained that hard,
even Seoul wouldn't be safe.

00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:15.951
I drew a blank.

00:50:16.076 --> 00:50:18.328
You're thrilled.

00:50:19.412 --> 00:50:21.206
If we tear down the fence,

00:50:21.748 --> 00:50:25.544
when the dam breaks,
all our chickens will get washed away.

00:50:25.627 --> 00:50:30.215
Who said that?
The drainage systems are so solid.

00:50:30.298 --> 00:50:33.176
Mr. Baek said that. Go ahead.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.553
-Mr. Baek?
-Yeah.

00:50:34.636 --> 00:50:37.055
What are you talking about?
Mr. Baek is in Namhae.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.642
Right, his son said so, right?

00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:42.477
Right.

00:50:43.186 --> 00:50:44.187
His son told us.

00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:46.773
His son did?

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.364
You're great at prepping bean sprouts.
Looks like you've done it a lot.

00:50:56.449 --> 00:50:59.411
You must've had plenty of experience.

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:05.166
Ladies, how's the village these days?
No floods, I assume?

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.044
Yeah, it's been a while.

00:51:08.128 --> 00:51:11.423
That's all because the fences
were repaired ten years ago.

00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:16.803
Right, those architects
living in the twin house

00:51:16.887 --> 00:51:19.556
-did something for us.
-Right.

00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:23.602
All the fences were replaced back then,
which is why there's less flooding.

00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:29.065
Really? Then we shouldn't tear it down.
Why break something built so well?

00:51:29.149 --> 00:51:31.902
Why destroy something they built so well?
We shouldn't.

00:51:31.985 --> 00:51:34.154
-We can't. I had no idea.
-We shouldn't.

00:51:34.237 --> 00:51:36.156
My goodness.

00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:42.704
So, it was you spreading nonsense to them.

00:51:42.787 --> 00:51:44.915
You know this area sits low.

00:51:44.998 --> 00:51:49.377
So? It's below the dam,
so heavy rain could cause flooding?

00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:50.420
You know it well.

00:51:50.503 --> 00:51:52.088
That's why my dad

00:51:52.172 --> 00:51:54.925
and your parents
fixed all the fences in this area.

00:51:55.884 --> 00:51:58.887
These fences help the rainwater drain,
reducing flooding.

00:51:59.888 --> 00:52:02.265
Stop it. The project is a bad idea.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.269
That's your hypothesis
since you consider architecture as art.

00:52:06.353 --> 00:52:09.356
As a civil servant in architecture,
my take differs.

00:52:09.439 --> 00:52:12.901
The ones I'm planning to tear down
are the outer fences along the road.

00:52:12.984 --> 00:52:14.736
Taking it down won't cause flooding.

00:52:16.613 --> 00:52:17.948
I'll prove it to you.

00:52:18.698 --> 00:52:20.075
How can you prove it?

00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:30.961
Now what? Tear it down some more?

00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:33.588
Sure, keep smashing.
Don't hold anything back.

00:52:34.464 --> 00:52:36.049
Okay, more!

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.689
What are you doing?

00:52:51.648 --> 00:52:53.191
So cool.

00:53:06.371 --> 00:53:07.414
Once it's gone…

00:53:09.708 --> 00:53:11.668
this summer will be over.

00:53:16.965 --> 00:53:17.966
Not there!

00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:21.219
-Not there, stop!
-Stop.

00:53:21.302 --> 00:53:22.721
-Just the outer fence!
-Stop!

00:53:22.804 --> 00:53:24.139
Stop! Enough!

00:53:25.181 --> 00:53:26.224
Outer fence…

00:53:26.307 --> 00:53:27.350
Wait.

00:53:31.187 --> 00:53:34.149
Ms. Song, what do we do about this?

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.948
I thought we were smashing
all the fences.

00:53:42.574 --> 00:53:45.160
His hearing is bad. I'm so sorry.

00:53:47.287 --> 00:53:50.081
All right, let's discuss
how to deal with this.

00:53:50.165 --> 00:53:55.462
Sir, you can't just
tear everything down like this.

00:53:55.545 --> 00:53:58.965
Especially when
we're in heavy-rain warning season.

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:02.218
You should've stopped
when everyone told you no.

00:54:02.302 --> 00:54:07.599
Why's the most rational person
at the office acting like this?

00:54:07.682 --> 00:54:11.394
-I'll take full responsibility.
-And how are you going to do that?

00:54:11.478 --> 00:54:16.232
The inner fence collapsed, so your house
won't hold up through the rainy season.

00:54:16.316 --> 00:54:20.528
You know that'll affect the houses below
and the one next to it too.

00:54:20.612 --> 00:54:23.782
People here are already traumatized
by flooding.

00:54:23.865 --> 00:54:25.116
We might get complaints--

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.619
There's no heavy rain advisory yet.

00:54:27.702 --> 00:54:29.287
I'll take care of it before that.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:32.582
Okay, then how?
How are you going to go about it?

00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:38.254
I'll get the spare flood barriers
and borrow a pump.

00:54:38.338 --> 00:54:40.507
How are you going to handle it
by yourself?

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.092
-I'll help.
-My goodness.

00:54:48.389 --> 00:54:49.349
Hold it.

00:54:56.898 --> 00:54:57.732
Here.

00:55:01.736 --> 00:55:03.571
Hey, I'll do it myself. You should go.

00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:06.699
This is already enough. Thanks.

00:55:09.702 --> 00:55:11.663
That's enough, just go.

00:55:12.705 --> 00:55:15.083
I'm not helping you.

00:55:15.166 --> 00:55:18.503
I'm fixing my house
that got damaged because of you.

00:55:25.593 --> 00:55:26.469
Hey.

00:55:27.053 --> 00:55:29.597
You're mocking me right now, aren't you?

00:55:36.563 --> 00:55:39.524
No. I really feel bad.

00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:44.154
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:55:45.446 --> 00:55:46.489
I really can't do it.

00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:50.451
I can't sell the house.

00:55:54.706 --> 00:55:56.499
You want to say that right now?

00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.126
Because of this situation.

00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:03.131
If so…

00:56:04.883 --> 00:56:07.218
-I guess I have no choice but sue.
-Go on.

00:56:08.219 --> 00:56:09.470
If that's the only option.

00:56:15.101 --> 00:56:17.687
I knew this would happen.

00:56:20.732 --> 00:56:24.861
Summer is always
the absolute worst for me.

00:56:25.528 --> 00:56:30.200
This is full cement,
so it'll take a while to dry.

00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:31.993
Still, let's give it a try.

00:56:32.076 --> 00:56:35.705
-Thanks, I'm counting on you, sir.
-But it won't be easy.

00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.503
Where did it all go wrong with my summer?

00:56:44.255 --> 00:56:45.423
In fact,

00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:48.009
I know the answer.

00:56:49.844 --> 00:56:50.929
It's all…

00:56:51.888 --> 00:56:54.098
Baek Do-ha's fault.

00:57:15.245 --> 00:57:17.288
You're always here, Ha-gyeong.

00:57:18.248 --> 00:57:20.750
You're always dangling like this
when you're upset.

00:57:26.047 --> 00:57:27.590
I somehow expected it.

00:57:29.342 --> 00:57:31.636
Every time he shows up in my life…

00:57:32.762 --> 00:57:36.015
everything always turns into a mess.

00:57:36.099 --> 00:57:37.433
JONG-MAN

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:48.236
I'll let the ash tree grow really big
and build a tree house on top.

00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:53.408
Hey, it'll take more than ten years.
Who's going to climb that?

00:57:53.491 --> 00:57:54.492
You and me.

00:57:56.869 --> 00:57:57.912
What the…

00:58:02.959 --> 00:58:06.754
In 2007, that summer brought a rainbow
even though it wasn't rainy season.

00:58:11.509 --> 00:58:13.845
Yay, I won.

00:58:14.846 --> 00:58:18.683
Summer of 2011, the rain poured so hard,

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.144
I couldn't hear anything else.

00:58:23.521 --> 00:58:24.689
Let me see.

00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:27.066
-My goodness.
-Let's go home first.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:30.903
Summer of 2012,
we faced the monsoon rains head-on.

00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:33.323
One, two, three!

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:37.827
Summer of 2013,

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:41.497
even the starlight
felt too strong to bear.

00:58:41.581 --> 00:58:44.042
JONG-MAN

00:58:48.379 --> 00:58:53.426
In 2014, the summer drove us mad
with heatstroke.

00:58:53.509 --> 00:58:54.677
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:58.181
Say something.
Just say something, Baek Do-ha.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.892
Say something.

00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:03.269
Make some excuse, at least!

00:59:10.902 --> 00:59:11.903
Get lost.

00:59:14.656 --> 00:59:16.699
Let's not see each other again.

00:59:18.701 --> 00:59:19.994
You son of a bitch.

00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.913
And in 2022,

00:59:23.122 --> 00:59:28.086
that summer left my body and mind drained
even without rain.

00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:32.924
Okay.

00:59:33.549 --> 00:59:35.760
The memories just came flooding back.

00:59:36.552 --> 00:59:38.971
It was completely frozen in the freezer,

00:59:39.764 --> 00:59:42.892
but the summer heat melted it away.

00:59:46.354 --> 00:59:50.525
I hated summer so much
that I wanted to run away from it.

00:59:54.904 --> 00:59:58.324
My summers have been full of Baek Do-ha,

00:59:59.075 --> 01:00:01.703
and in those summers, nothing went right.

01:00:09.627 --> 01:00:10.837
Song Ha-gyeong.

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:15.550
Do you still hate me so much?

01:00:26.352 --> 01:00:28.187
I was always unlucky in summer.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:33.025
Because every summer,
Baek Do-ha came back.

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:36.487
And…

01:00:37.697 --> 01:00:38.990
looks like my summer…

01:00:40.324 --> 01:00:42.368
is doomed again.

01:01:10.605 --> 01:01:13.816
-Why did you come back?
-You finally want to know?

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:17.069
What did Do-ha say when he hired you?

01:01:17.153 --> 01:01:19.197
What are the conditions and purpose?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.241
Looks like Mr. Baek
knows everything about you, Ms. Song.

01:01:22.325 --> 01:01:24.285
Should I give you the whole house?

01:01:24.368 --> 01:01:26.412
Get out! Don't come in.

01:01:27.872 --> 01:01:31.250
You should've been put in jail for fraud
two years ago.

01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:34.462
Can selling the house erase
17 years of our memories?

01:01:34.545 --> 01:01:38.174
Why are you two
so obsessed with the peanut house?

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:40.134
I can't stand it anymore!

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:41.803
I'm so sick of it!

01:01:42.386 --> 01:01:43.596
Stop lying.

01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:47.809
You won't win this time.
I'm not letting you win.

01:01:47.892 --> 01:01:50.394
Let's see this through,
right into the mud.

01:01:50.478 --> 01:01:52.563
That's the ending that suits us.
