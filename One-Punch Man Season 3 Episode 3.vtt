ORGANISM LIMITS

01:42.080 --> 01:43.750
Well, this is a surprise.

01:43.830 --> 01:47.920
I never expected Zombieman to be a
test subject from the House of Evolution.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.330
I have many memories of Sample No. 66.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.750
You were an excellent specimen
and my only success

01:54.830 --> 01:56.710
in my immortality experiments.

01:56.830 --> 01:59.750
But then, you destroyed the lab
and disappeared.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.040
That was over ten years ago.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.460
And now, you've become a hero.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.250
You actually managed to change yourself.

02:08.919 --> 02:12.000
So you're going to kill me?
That's fine too.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.080
Why did the House of Evolution
disappear?

02:14.380 --> 02:17.290
You can rebuild it as many times
as you want, as long as you're alive.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.540
Answer me, Dr. Genus!

02:20.040 --> 02:22.290
My research was a failure.

02:22.380 --> 02:26.750
I witnessed a power that
far surpassed artificial evolution.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.460
He removed his limiter.

02:29.790 --> 02:30.880
Limiter?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.830
No matter how much
an organism strives

02:32.920 --> 02:35.920
there are limits to its growth.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.130
An overabundance of strength is
a burden to its bearer

02:40.290 --> 02:42.040
and can cause malfunctions.

02:42.250 --> 02:45.420
Or they may become a monster who
has lost all humanity

02:45.500 --> 02:47.170
and rage out of control.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.460
For that reason

02:49.540 --> 02:52.880
God has designed each creature
to grow within parameters

02:52.960 --> 02:56.080
that allow for survival and
the preservation of reason.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.960
And that is what a limiter is.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.460
But he was different.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.130
By pushing himself
beyond his boundaries

03:40.210 --> 03:43.290
he removed his limiter and
obtained unfathomable strength.

03:43.420 --> 03:48.420
Is strength without a limiter
something one can gain without any cost?

03:48.670 --> 03:51.210
Of course not, he paid a price.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.500
In exchange for his strength,
he went bald.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.630
He also suffers from the loneliness
that comes with such overwhelming power.

03:57.710 --> 04:01.250
After defeating the strongest warrior
in my lab’s history with a single punch

04:01.330 --> 04:04.330
the look on his face said it all.

04:04.630 --> 04:05.710
Ridiculous.

04:05.790 --> 04:08.330
Sounds like
the only malfunction caused

04:08.420 --> 04:10.420
by your bizarre research
was in your own head.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.630
I have seen many monsters who've
ignored the limits of their abilities.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.829
Most likely this is far beyond...

04:18.920 --> 04:21.250
...what you’re imagining.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.380
The triggers for becoming a monster vary.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.710
A spiraling obsession or

04:24.790 --> 04:26.960
an inferiority complex leading to
a desire to transform

04:27.080 --> 04:30.040
or an explosion of pent-up frustration.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.580
The causes may vary

04:31.670 --> 04:33.710
but in every case their cells
suffer abnormalities

04:33.790 --> 04:35.750
and they became mutated creatures.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.170
Others, like those born
from my research

04:38.250 --> 04:41.040
were deliberately created
through scientific means.

04:41.330 --> 04:44.420
Many non-human creatures
mutate into monstrous forms

04:44.500 --> 04:47.130
due to environmental pollution
or other factors.

04:47.630 --> 04:50.040
But that is simply
becoming another species.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.250
It is not the same as
breaking the limiter.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.670
The Clan of the Seafolk
who attacked City J

04:54.750 --> 04:56.380
and the aliens
that appeared in City A

04:56.460 --> 04:58.380
can be broadly classified as monsters.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.080
But they were always creatures
like that from the start

05:01.170 --> 05:04.080
and natural enemies of mankind
with an intelligence of their own.

05:04.460 --> 05:09.670
Heroes possess the great power
to confront and fight against them.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.580
Those heroes are born with
the potential to become strong

05:12.710 --> 05:15.920
and they cultivated it
through effort and talent.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.920
Some have undergone
cybernetic enhancements

05:18.000 --> 05:21.830
or have acquired special abilities
through human experimentation, like you.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.960
Some are born as
extraordinary geniuses like me

05:25.040 --> 05:26.670
or gifted with unique abilities.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.380
But he was different.

05:29.630 --> 05:33.460
Born ordinary, lived an ordinary life,
and possessed no special talent.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.080
He was just a regular person.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.960
But through sheer effort alone
he forced open the door to his limits

05:38.040 --> 05:39.830
and shattered his limiter.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.500
The strength of someone
who has removed their limiter

05:42.580 --> 05:45.170
and undergone self-evolution
is truly remarkable...

05:45.920 --> 05:48.420
Just thinking about it
now makes me laugh

05:48.500 --> 05:51.040
at how absurd my own ambitions were.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.250
One day, you may have
a chance to meet him too.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.000
Apparently, he's also a hero.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.330
Do you have any more questions?

05:59.540 --> 06:01.630
So why takoyaki?

06:02.040 --> 06:04.130
While researching human regeneration

06:04.250 --> 06:07.250
I found a way to endlessly
regenerate octopus legs.

06:07.420 --> 06:08.500
I see.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.250
<i>I can beat these guys.</i>

06:15.500 --> 06:18.330
<i>They're nothing compared</i>
<i>to the old geezer.</i>

06:18.670 --> 06:21.210
I can't believe a human
could go this far.

06:21.460 --> 06:25.290
It's two against one.
You must be pretty strong.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.500
I was gonna toy
with you a bit, but forget it.

06:30.630 --> 06:31.630
Let's finish this...

06:31.830 --> 06:33.420
The real fight starts now.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.000
I've figured out all your moves.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.500
You'll never hit me again.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.960
- Old dude...
- Hm?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.380
- Oh.
- Huh?

06:49.830 --> 06:53.080
Old dude... Sorry...

06:53.540 --> 06:56.210
Hedro-Jellyfish, what brings you here?

06:56.500 --> 06:59.920
I've got a personal grudge
with that guy.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.380
<i>That bastard...</i>

07:02.420 --> 07:04.630
Hey! That damn brat's got
nothing to do with this!

07:17.790 --> 07:18.830
Oh my.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.040
Hey!

07:20.290 --> 07:22.540
Weren't the orders not to kill him?

07:22.670 --> 07:25.670
You should've stopped me sooner,
Insect God.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.080
Too late now, he's dead.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.080
Phew... Come on,
let's all get out of here.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.210
BLEEP BLEEP

07:44.330 --> 07:46.170
WHACK
BLIP BLOP

07:46.250 --> 07:47.960
<i>Why did he want to</i>
<i>watch me play a game?</i>

07:48.040 --> 07:49.170
<i>What's he up to?</i>

07:49.630 --> 07:51.500
So I cleared the game.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.580
So? You happy now?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.250
Is it over already?

07:55.540 --> 07:57.540
I didn't understand it at all.

07:58.130 --> 08:01.250
<i>So it's still too soon for me to</i>
<i>join the simulated battles</i>

08:01.380 --> 08:04.000
<i>that Master Saitama and King</i>
<i>usually play.</i>

08:04.290 --> 08:05.830
<i>I need to level up more.</i>

08:06.040 --> 08:07.460
<i>So many things I need to work on.</i>

08:07.750 --> 08:10.080
It's getting late.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.630
You won't find Garou
just by searching blindly.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.580
He's most likely holed up with
the monsters at their hideout.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.750
Master's resolve seemed unshakable.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.710
Until he discovers and destroys
the Monster Association's base

08:21.790 --> 08:23.130
he might not return.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.710
Saitama is strong
but with that personality

08:26.790 --> 08:28.170
I'm a little worried.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.630
If he were to fall into
the monsters' trap by chance...

08:34.750 --> 08:35.960
I'm home!

08:36.289 --> 08:37.289
It's Master!

08:37.419 --> 08:38.750
He came back
like it was nothing.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.789
Were you successful?

08:41.080 --> 08:42.630
Geez...

08:42.919 --> 08:43.960
Phew...

08:45.080 --> 08:46.960
Man, that was a disaster...

08:47.460 --> 08:49.000
What a mess I got into.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.080
- What?!
- What?!

08:50.170 --> 08:52.790
Don't tell me you really
found Garou?

08:53.130 --> 08:55.830
What? You guys are still here?

08:56.290 --> 08:57.630
It's too cramped in here.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.710
Master! There is blood on you.
Is it from the Hero Hunter?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.670
No, I ran into a monster
on my way home.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.330
Was it from
the Monster Association?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.500
No, there are always
monsters around here.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.080
Who knows why?

09:09.790 --> 09:12.210
Anyway, that's not the problem at all.

09:12.460 --> 09:15.830
What happened that
was so disastrous?

09:16.170 --> 09:17.880
You were all fired up when you left.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.630
Who did what to you?

09:21.710 --> 09:22.880
The thing is...

09:24.170 --> 09:25.960
I dropped my wallet somewhere.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.540
It had about 6,000 yen inside.

09:29.170 --> 09:33.380
That's all? I thought
you had a run in with Garou.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.880
Oh no!
Now that you mention it.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.130
Yeah, what happened?

09:37.880 --> 09:40.170
Th-That dine-and-dasher!

09:40.290 --> 09:41.880
You know who it is?

09:42.330 --> 09:44.250
When I was chasing him...

09:44.960 --> 09:48.540
The napa cabbage I bought!
I left it in a family restaurant!

09:48.790 --> 09:50.790
Oh no. I'll go recover it.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.460
No, Genos.
You cannot with those injuries.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.290
All this over napa cabbage?

09:56.330 --> 09:57.710
Sounds like you're all having fun.

09:58.130 --> 10:02.170
You're back again, Hellish Blizzard?
What do you want this time?

10:02.290 --> 10:04.540
Saitama... How dare you.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.830
Is... Is that the napa cabbage?
Why does Blizzard have it?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.000
Here, you forgot this.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.790
Yay, you saved the day!

10:13.920 --> 10:16.040
I feel like having hot pot tonight.

10:16.670 --> 10:18.920
And what's a hot pot
without napa cabbage!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.960
Don't you have
anything else to say to me?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.540
Huh? Thanks for the napa cabbage.

10:25.250 --> 10:31.420
No! Apologize for sticking me
with the bill at the restaurant!

10:31.580 --> 10:34.540
Oh yeah, forgot about that.
S-Sorry.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.920
You even left in the middle
of our conversation again!

10:37.040 --> 10:39.330
Huh? Were we talking
about something?

10:39.460 --> 10:41.380
See, I knew you weren't listening!

10:41.580 --> 10:45.880
Anyway, you owe me one.
Don't you forget it!

10:46.420 --> 10:48.830
<i>She knows</i>
<i>she's not in our league.</i>

10:48.920 --> 10:50.130
<i>Why does</i>
<i>she keep coming around?</i>

10:50.880 --> 10:52.960
<i>Does she also want to</i>
<i>become Master's disciple?</i>

10:53.250 --> 10:55.580
<i>It'd be a hassle</i>
<i>if Master's workload increases.</i>

10:55.670 --> 10:57.880
<i>I must prevent that at all costs.</i>

10:59.170 --> 11:00.630
High-speed approach detected.

11:00.750 --> 11:01.710
Something is coming!

11:01.790 --> 11:02.790
<i>Damn it.</i>

11:02.880 --> 11:05.250
<i>With these injuries,</i>
<i>I won't be able to fight properly.</i>

11:05.500 --> 11:07.130
<i>Bang and his brother are injured.</i>

11:07.250 --> 11:11.250
<i>Blizzard likely wouldn't stand a chance</i>
<i>if the enemy is Demon level or above.</i>

11:11.750 --> 11:15.130
<i>Master has suffered serious psychological</i>
<i>damage from losing his wallet.</i>

11:15.250 --> 11:17.460
<i>The only one</i>
<i>who can fight right now is...</i>

11:18.250 --> 11:22.080
King! An enemy approaches,
go outside and intercept it.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.210
Huh?

11:23.330 --> 11:25.790
- We cannot allow a fight in here.
- Why not?

11:25.880 --> 11:28.630
- Just go outside!
- Wait, there's no need to push.

11:28.710 --> 11:30.040
Let's calm down.
What's going on?

11:30.170 --> 11:31.960
Don't worry.
There's only one enemy.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
But why?!

11:33.460 --> 11:34.580
What's going on, Genos?

11:34.710 --> 11:37.500
A monster has come,
but I asked King to take care of it.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.710
Uh-oh...

11:39.500 --> 11:42.250
It was right outside the front door.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.630
You have a visitor.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.710
What the...? King!
Why would you invite it in?

11:45.790 --> 11:49.380
No, wait. Looks like you've been
badly damaged again.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.830
You mustn't push yourself.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.130
It's me, Genos.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.500
Dr. Kuseno!

11:56.670 --> 11:58.670
You know him?
What a relief.

11:58.790 --> 11:59.880
Why are you here?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
I was worried about you.

12:02.130 --> 12:06.420
Soon after I repaired you,
I received another distress signal.

12:06.540 --> 12:09.670
So I wanted to personally check in
on you and see what's going on.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.750
I'm sorry to worry you.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.000
I said I wouldn't lose again,
and yet...

12:14.080 --> 12:15.380
I'm surprised.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.210
I had improved your systems
and firepower considerably...

12:19.500 --> 12:21.130
Well, don't worry about it.

12:21.250 --> 12:24.080
Your life is more important
than winning.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.750
So what happened to the enemy
that damaged you so badly?

12:28.210 --> 12:30.290
As usual, Master Saitama defeated it...

12:30.540 --> 12:32.420
I see... So you must be...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.250
Genos's master, Saitama.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.710
I've always wanted to
meet you...

12:36.830 --> 12:38.290
Mind taking your shoes off?

12:38.420 --> 12:40.920
Oh! So sorry!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.960
ONE-PUNCH MAN

12:44.170 --> 12:45.380
I am Kuseno.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.960
I used to be just a humble
mechanical engineer

12:48.130 --> 12:51.080
but due to circumstances, I now support
Genos in his pursuit of justice.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.920
I'm Saitama.
Nice to meet you.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.040
I see...

12:54.130 --> 12:58.040
It warms my heart that Genos
has found such a respectable mentor.

12:58.420 --> 12:59.920
When Genos and I first met...

13:00.040 --> 13:02.960
- He came to pick you up Genos!
- we had no allies at all.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.420
- It's cramped in here, so let's wrap!
- We wandered through the darkness...

13:06.500 --> 13:07.960
- Later, Kuseno!
- We battled evil...

13:08.040 --> 13:10.830
Doctor, please summarize
in 20 characters or less.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.710
Oh, come on.
Don't say that.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.460
Since I knew that I would be
visiting Saitama's place

13:15.580 --> 13:17.080
I brought a little something.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.380
Is it some kind of
enhancement part for Master?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.920
Hey, I'm human, you know...

13:21.040 --> 13:24.670
The ultimate premium deluxe beef gift set.

13:24.790 --> 13:26.330
Top quality.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.040
Think of it as a token of gratitude
for taking care of Genos.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.130
Will you please accept it?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.380
Oh? Fancy meat, huh...

13:33.500 --> 13:36.130
I haven't had meat in ages...

13:36.330 --> 13:37.830
Kuseno...

13:37.920 --> 13:39.250
...I mean, Dr. Kuseno.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.130
As Genos's mentors,
I'm sure we have a lot to talk about.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.210
Please feel free to
drop by anytime you like!

13:47.290 --> 13:49.170
<i>What a sucker.</i>
<i>That was too easy.</i>

13:49.250 --> 13:52.920
<i>Now I feel silly for thinking</i>
<i>it'd be hard to recruit him.</i>

13:53.290 --> 13:55.170
Okay, let's put this
in the hot pot too.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.130
I'll go chop the vegetables.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.420
You're going to use
that premium beef for a hot pot?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.630
What a waste.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.750
Do you have any red wine here?

14:05.920 --> 14:07.330
Hm? Of course not.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.460
Oh!

14:08.580 --> 14:11.130
You're not thinking of staying
for dinner, are you?

14:11.420 --> 14:13.880
If you have no business here,
it's time to leave.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.710
Come on, King, old guys,
go on home!

14:17.420 --> 14:19.540
We had a little chat with Garou.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.750
And he failed the test.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.830
Well actually, in the heat of
the moment, we killed him.

14:25.210 --> 14:31.080
We said we just wanted to talk,
but then he suddenly attacked us!

14:31.170 --> 14:33.710
How despicable, right, Insect God?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.420
Are those worthless lies
all you've got?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.750
Tell me what really happened.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.630
He was just some half-assed guy
calling himself a monster.

14:44.750 --> 14:48.670
He could turn on us at any moment,
depending on the situation.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.290
So what?

14:50.420 --> 14:54.000
You got a problem because
we took care of him on our own?

14:54.170 --> 14:57.000
No complaints.
I'm glad you both went.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.500
You two seem pretty beaten up.
Was he strong?

15:01.540 --> 15:04.080
That lean body of his packed
way more power than I expected

15:04.170 --> 15:05.250
and took me off guard.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.210
Now I know why
you sent the two of us.

15:08.330 --> 15:09.960
So is he really dead?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.670
We didn't double-check,
but I'm pretty sure he is.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.500
It's because Insect God
was slow to stop me.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.500
You wanted to kill him from the start!

15:19.960 --> 15:20.960
<i>Old dude...</i>

15:23.080 --> 15:25.420
So, what's with the kid?

15:25.790 --> 15:28.040
He saw us, so we brought him in.

15:28.580 --> 15:29.710
What are you laughing about?

15:29.790 --> 15:31.290
Get rid of him immediately.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.420
Come on, don't get so mad.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.210
I brought him so I can take
my time tormenting him later.

15:36.290 --> 15:37.830
I gotta let off steam

15:37.920 --> 15:41.330
or I'll end up impulsively
slashing someone here again.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.040
There's no time left
for playing around.

15:44.580 --> 15:48.290
A Hero Association surveillance robot
was spotted right near our hideout.

15:48.540 --> 15:52.130
They'll pinpoint this location
in less than a day.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.960
That means the Class-S heroes
we've all been waiting for

15:55.040 --> 15:56.210
will finally be sent our way.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.500
And they're formidable opponents.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.330
Everyone, prepare for battle!

16:01.670 --> 16:03.580
Is it true it was an easy win?

16:03.710 --> 16:06.580
Yeah, Gyoro-Gyoro picks opponents
based on compatibility.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.210
Compatibility, my ass!

16:08.500 --> 16:10.830
Cowering in front of mere humans!?

16:11.130 --> 16:16.170
Strong monsters like me will
take 'em down in a head-on clash.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.630
Pathetic!

16:18.290 --> 16:21.210
If that story is true, then I should
be able to become one too...

16:21.580 --> 16:23.920
The Monster King Phoenix Man!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.790
Listen up, you guys.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.460
I want one kill from each of you.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.960
Put your life on the line!

16:30.750 --> 16:33.460
And the credit will be all mine!

16:35.880 --> 16:38.750
Didn't you hear?
No killing fellow monsters.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.750
You pseudo-monsters have
no right to defy us real monsters.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.460
Know your place!

16:44.580 --> 16:46.540
Malong Hair, you're so powerful!

16:46.630 --> 16:47.960
Are you threat level Demon?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.080
Like a tiger with wings
and chestnut long hair.

16:50.290 --> 16:53.580
Straightening my hair gave me power.
That is what created Malong Hair.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.210
Wow, so you monsterized
by doing proper hair care?

16:57.670 --> 17:02.670
Hey Nyaan, when Puri-Puri Prisoner
shows up let us take care of him.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.040
Yeah, sounds good.

17:04.210 --> 17:06.250
We're strong enough now
to get back at him.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.829
I won't be happy until
I kill that guy with my own hands.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.040
Very well.
Do as you please and go wild.

17:12.790 --> 17:16.790
The only real top-tier fighter in
the Hero Association is Flashy Flash.

17:17.290 --> 17:18.579
All the rest are just small fry.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.920
There are people with supernatural powers
and robots on their side.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.579
Robots are irrelevant.

17:24.920 --> 17:29.460
No machine could ever keep up
with a ninja's speed.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.880
What about the
supernatural powers?

18:34.330 --> 18:37.710
We'll kill them so quickly that they
won't be able to activate their powers.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.670
You're G5, right?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.750
What's that?
Did you steal that from somewhere?

18:53.880 --> 18:57.540
It's a little something I picked up
for my own interests.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.790
I plan to take it apart
and analyze it in detail.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.290
<i>Metal Knight is in pieces?!</i>

19:03.830 --> 19:05.830
It's a valuable sample.

19:06.290 --> 19:07.330
If you'll excuse me.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.830
Waganma, I brought you a friend.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.250
Who are you? I'm Tareo.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.130
Were you captured by the monsters, too?

19:22.710 --> 19:24.960
Umm...Waganma?

19:25.380 --> 19:28.540
Yeah. Hey, is it nighttime already?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.170
Y-Yeah.

19:30.710 --> 19:33.040
You got any food?

19:33.170 --> 19:37.290
I have candy. I only have one piece,
but if you want it...

19:40.630 --> 19:41.630
Anything else?

19:41.710 --> 19:43.880
S-Sorry, no.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.580
Damn, you're useless.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.710
So...what's gonna happen to us?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.380
Those monsters sure are dumb.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.460
What?

19:54.540 --> 19:56.630
I mean, of all people,
they kidnapped me!

19:56.920 --> 19:59.630
My dad's a big shot
in the Hero Association.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.920
Really?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.290
Yeah, I'm sure the Hero Association
won't sit back.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.130
They'll come and save me right away.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.420
Maybe I'll have them rescue you too,
while they're at it.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.000
- Really?
- I'll ask the heroes for you.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.500
Yes, please!

20:12.670 --> 20:16.540
- Then from now on, you work for me.
- Huh?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.040
You gotta problem?

20:18.210 --> 20:19.460
You wanna be rescued, right?

20:19.580 --> 20:20.630
Uh-huh.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.500
I wanna go home.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.500
What are you two talking about?

20:24.630 --> 20:26.290
Yikes! A monster!

20:26.630 --> 20:29.670
Sorry, but you two
are never going home.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.500
What a shame.

20:31.580 --> 20:34.000
If you don't let me
go home right now

20:34.130 --> 20:35.420
the heroes are gonna come!

20:36.960 --> 20:39.540
You're all gonna die.
The heroes and your dad too.

20:39.670 --> 20:43.540
All because they came to save you.
Everyone will die!

20:46.790 --> 20:48.540
Class-S heroes are coming, you know!

20:48.670 --> 20:51.580
You guys are going to
get your butts kicked!

20:51.710 --> 20:55.290
Yeah, Metal Bat alone
could take all of you out.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.080
I know. I saw him up close.
It'll be a piece of cake for him.

20:58.210 --> 21:01.380
Yeah, sure thing.
Ohh, I'm so scared of Metal Bat.

21:03.290 --> 21:07.710
Um...Waganma...
I saw on the news...

21:07.880 --> 21:10.960
All of 'em... Lightning Genji,
Heavy Kong, Metal Bat...

21:11.540 --> 21:13.710
And also Metal Knight...
just a while ago were...

21:14.080 --> 21:17.580
So? The Hero Association has
Tornado and Blast too.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.040
Oh yeah, and there's King too!

21:20.500 --> 21:21.580
How do you like that?

21:21.670 --> 21:23.460
I bet just hearing
that name scares you!

21:23.710 --> 21:28.290
Hey, kid. Do you even know why
the Monster Association was created?

21:28.500 --> 21:32.040
To wipe every last one
of those pests off the map.

21:32.330 --> 21:36.580
We knew from the start that
the Class-S heroes are insanely strong.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.380
But I'm still telling you.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.540
Every last hero will die.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.880
We've got crazy monsters
far more dangerous

21:42.960 --> 21:44.670
than the Class-S heroes.

21:44.920 --> 21:49.630
Especially our top monsters,
who are threat level Dragon.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.710
Possessing miraculous strength....

21:59.830 --> 22:04.000
They're like God's own works of art!

22:04.210 --> 22:06.830
Humans don't stand
a chance against them.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.580
Even King will die.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.830
COUNTERATTACK SIGNAL
