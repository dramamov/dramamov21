Miss Feng.

00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:14.992
My belly hurts.

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:15.992
May I use the toilet?

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.031
Make it quick.

00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:18.792
Okay.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:19.952
It's hurting.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:26.952
Gu Qianfu?

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.072
Why is he here?

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.151
Spare some change, please.

00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:33.792

00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:35.191

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:45.352
Spare some change.

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:48.672
Spare some change.

00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:49.992
Spare some change.

00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:58.072
(Funds ran out long ago.)

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.272
(To think I would sink so low)

00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:01.672
(and covet a beggar's meal...)

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:02.512
(How)

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:04.512
(u-utterly humiliating!)

00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:05.711
(No way.)

00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:07.792
(I can't do this.)

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:13.952
This pancake's completely dried out.

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:15.352
How do I eat this?

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.392
I didn't pick this up from the ground.

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.512
He threw it away.

00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:30.191
I just happened to catch it.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.871
After all, I'm Gu Qianfu,

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:37.512
a respectable imperial official.

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:52.832
People from

00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:54.512
the Jing'an Bureau have no dignity.

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:56.871
Lure him away.

00:03:57.232 --> 00:03:58.072
I don't want a tail.

00:03:58.232 --> 00:03:58.992
Understood.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:03:59.512
Let's go.

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:05.272
Want a duster?

00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:05.792
How much?

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:06.311
Five wen.

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:07.311
Too expensive.

00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.711
Five wen for a lousy duster?

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.311
Two eggs and two quail eggs

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.232
cost the same.

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:15.552
Who'd buy this?

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.271
One wen and it's yours.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.472
Cheapskate.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:23.831
Who's a cheapskate?

00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:25.112
- Do you know who...?
- Stop!

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:26.472
Stop.

00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:28.831
Stop there, traitor.

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:32.191
Traitor?

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:36.792
He went this way.

00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:37.271
Get him.

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:44.311
The former Crown Prince.

00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.631
One wen.

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:53.831
Commander, we found Jia Xun's hideout.

00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:03.431
Did he run away?

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:04.992
What do we do now?

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:06.552
Go over there.

00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:07.311
Search.

00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:08.040
Understood.

00:05:13.232 --> 00:05:13.831
Young master.

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:15.391
You're quite handsome.

00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:17.511
May I know your name?

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:19.071
I have no name.

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:21.672
H-how can that be?

00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:23.431
Where are you from?

00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:25.391
From where I came from.

00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.792
Where are you going?

00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:29.672
To where I should go.

00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.232
Please stop teasing me.

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:33.672
We seem destined to meet.

00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:34.912
I'd like to know you.

00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:36.271
Miss.

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:38.152
We're not destined to meet.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:39.032
You don't

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:39.871
have to know me.

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:41.431
I don't care.

00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:43.912
Today, I'll make you my friend.

00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:45.871
Having fun chatting?

00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:49.552
I came at a bad time.

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.152
Honey.

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:53.431
Why are you here?

00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:55.912
You got me wrong.

00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:02.271
Who's your honey?

00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:05.871
Why so angry, Miss Feng?

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:10.352
Am I angry?

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:11.951
Or are you guilty?

00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:16.112
This is how I express admiration.

00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:19.712
You talk about admiration,

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:20.751
but won't help me?

00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.631
Hypocrite.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:23.511
Miss Feng.

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.751
I know you don't want to

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:28.191
harm the innocent.

00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:30.311
But this is the border

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.712
between Liang and Hua.

00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:34.191
Liang is seven days'

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:35.391
travel away.

00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:38.152
We own estates there.

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:39.472
No one can

00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:41.631
pressure you there.

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:43.631
What?

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:45.751
My father

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:48.431
has been preparing for his retirement.

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:50.552
That place seemed remote to me.

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:52.352
But now I realize

00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.152
that it's all part of his plan.

00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:58.071
Escape with me.

00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:05.112
I must complete the task

00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:08.951
to dispel His Majesty's doubts.

00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:11.071
Only then will you truly be safe.

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:13.191
My life is worth it

00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.391
since I've met you.

00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.271
(I sent a message
to Nanwu three days ago)

00:07:50.352 --> 00:07:51.511
(to warn Xue Youshou.)

00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:54.071
(You won't find him)

00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:55.152
(this time.)

00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.112
(He's already in Liang now.)

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:00.271
Mr. Xue.

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:02.232
Mr. Xue.

00:08:02.592 --> 00:08:03.071
Come in.

00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:08.792
Greetings, Mr. Xue.

00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:10.431
Please pick up your message

00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:11.464
at the escort agency.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:13.552
Escort agency?

00:08:17.512 --> 00:08:19.836
(Shunli Escort Agency)

00:08:29.071 --> 00:08:31.592
(Meet at the beacon-lit border
near Zhidao.)

00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:34.791
(Observe the vast Zhang River.
Abandon all worries.)

00:08:35.592 --> 00:08:37.031
(Why hasn't he gone to Liang?)

00:08:37.312 --> 00:08:37.712
Nothing.

00:08:37.712 --> 00:08:38.271
Please stop.

00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:39.192
- Master.
- Go home.

00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:39.992
Go home.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:42.832
Master, please help me.

00:08:42.952 --> 00:08:45.031
I can't afford the medicines
for my grandson.

00:08:45.112 --> 00:08:46.671
Please save him.

00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:48.232
Master.

00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:49.072
Take this.

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:50.192
Thank you.

00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:51.712
Please get up.

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:52.391
Thank you.

00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:53.151
Please get up.

00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.192
You're a living saint.

00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:54.832
Go now.

00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:56.072
Master.

00:08:56.232 --> 00:08:57.391
Come see my father.

00:08:57.551 --> 00:08:58.911
He's coughing up blood.

00:08:59.031 --> 00:08:59.551
Where?

00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:00.352
Show me.

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:07.871
Let me check your pulse.

00:09:12.832 --> 00:09:13.952
It's nothing serious.

00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:15.312
You're just stressed.

00:09:18.112 --> 00:09:19.592
Get your father some medicine

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.031
at the pharmacy.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:23.751
Wait.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.511
Pawn this and get something

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:33.791
to eat.

00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:35.232
Thank you.

00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:38.271
Sit up.

00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:41.871
I'm much better.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:43.271
Alright.

00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:44.192
Thank you.

00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.151
Nothing.

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.072
He's such a nice person.

00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:48.832
Indeed.

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:49.911
So compassionate.

00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:52.911
He seems like a changed man.

00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:56.432
Such virtue is rare.

00:10:00.352 --> 00:10:01.472
Thankfully, he's here.

00:10:05.312 --> 00:10:06.952
Master saved his life.

00:10:09.352 --> 00:10:09.871
Breathe.

00:10:25.352 --> 00:10:25.952
Come on in.

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:26.911
Careful.

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:34.031
Youshou.

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:36.751
Why are you still here?

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:38.472
Didn't I tell you

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:41.112
to take shelter in our estates

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:42.511
in Liang?

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:46.112
Years of fleeing

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:48.192
must end somewhere.

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:51.352
I explained everything in my letter.

00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:53.271
Our family faces imminent doom.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:54.992
You must leave.

00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.312
When your father took me with him,

00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.031
he said,

00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:05.112
"Never contact me unless"

00:11:06.192 --> 00:11:06.992
"it's critical."

00:11:07.952 --> 00:11:08.952
At critical moments,

00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:10.992
he'd contact me in person.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:13.472
No messengers.

00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:15.511
Especially not his son.

00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:19.671
You look extremely

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:21.232
nervous.

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:22.911
Have you

00:11:24.112 --> 00:11:24.952
found out about it?

00:11:27.192 --> 00:11:27.712
Yes.

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:30.151
Father told me.

00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:33.511
Why

00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:34.911
didn't you tell me who you are?

00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:38.352
You're a prince.

00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:39.592
It's unfair that you

00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:41.551
have to hide.

00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:43.551
A prince?

00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:48.151
The former Crown Prince.

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:51.072
It's shadier than being

00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:52.952
the illegitimate son.

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:55.671
I deserve to die.

00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:57.631
That emperor deserves to die.

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:58.352
Not you.

00:11:58.911 --> 00:11:59.712
Nonsense.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.391
Watch your tongue.

00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:03.871
I thought

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:06.472
the Emperor's murderous intent

00:12:06.631 --> 00:12:07.671
was just a rumor.

00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:08.911
I didn't know

00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:11.671
that all the misfortunes
we've been through

00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:14.352
were orchestrated by him

00:12:14.592 --> 00:12:15.511
to eliminate us.

00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:18.952
Even with his throne so secure,

00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:19.871
he still targets

00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:21.511
a defenseless man.

00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:23.112
So inhuman.

00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.712
Victors reign.

00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:26.911
In his position,

00:12:27.592 --> 00:12:28.952
he can do as he pleases.

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:30.671
Meanwhile,

00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:33.232
I must struggle to survive.

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:35.592
I've let go of everything.

00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:37.312
Right.

00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:39.232
Does Father know

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:40.832
about your visit?

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:42.751
Yeah.

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:49.232
I can tell you're rebellious.

00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:51.472
You must have come in secret,

00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:52.751
against his orders.

00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:56.511
Right.

00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:58.432
You said that

00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:01.352
you had been through a lot.

00:13:02.112 --> 00:13:03.551
Are you hanging in there?

00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:07.832
Father holds the title of Lord Dingyuan.

00:13:09.072 --> 00:13:10.712
We can withstand some petty tricks.

00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:18.911
Has your father decided

00:13:21.352 --> 00:13:22.352
to abandon me?

00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:27.271
We have plans in Liang.

00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:29.232
Come with me.

00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:31.671
Survival comes first.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:36.911
Lord Dingyuan

00:13:40.192 --> 00:13:41.511
is truly casting me aside?

00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:45.832
Youshou,

00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:48.031
my father has been

00:13:49.472 --> 00:13:50.751
bedridden for years.

00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:52.631
He's been exhausted

00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:54.391
by this matter.

00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:56.151
Don't blame him.

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.271
How could I blame him?

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:00.432
Without him,

00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:02.072
I would have died

00:14:02.312 --> 00:14:03.232
when I was seven.

00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.511
My whereabouts are exposed.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.072
Don't defy the authorities again

00:14:14.432 --> 00:14:15.391
by letting me escape.

00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:16.992
Turn me in.

00:14:17.712 --> 00:14:19.352
Earn merit for the Xue family.

00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:20.712
Are you crazy?

00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:22.671
After all these years,

00:14:23.871 --> 00:14:24.791
I'm tired of hiding.

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:27.352
I'll sever all ties with the Xues.

00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:31.271
Let me satisfy that Emperor's wish

00:14:33.511 --> 00:14:34.232
and consider this

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.232
repayment for your help.

00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:39.031
Youshou,

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:41.192
don't let everything go to waste.

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.391
Do you really think

00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:44.511
we'll be spared

00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:46.391
if we turn you in?

00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:49.511
He doesn't hesitate to kill

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:50.631
his confidant.

00:14:51.352 --> 00:14:52.671
My father risked our family

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:53.992
to protect you.

00:14:55.472 --> 00:14:56.551
If you do this,

00:14:57.911 --> 00:15:00.312
we'll be doomed together.

00:15:13.592 --> 00:15:14.312
(Traitor.)

00:15:15.312 --> 00:15:16.791
(Time to claim your life.)

00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:19.472
Miss Feng...

00:15:19.992 --> 00:15:20.472
How...

00:15:21.432 --> 00:15:22.551
You are Xue Youshou?

00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:25.031
Or should I call you

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.952
Crown Prince Jia Xun?

00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:32.592
He's not the Crown Prince.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.791
He's just my half-brother.

00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:37.592
Xue Guardian Feng Zuoren

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.151
is here to kill you.

00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:41.432
Any last words?

00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:44.472
You'll kill me?

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:47.031
Don't.

00:16:09.112 --> 00:16:09.791
The jade pendant.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.151
You remember it.

00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:16.871
Feng.

00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:25.751
Young master.

00:16:28.151 --> 00:16:28.871
(Young master?)

00:16:37.112 --> 00:16:37.952
It's been so long.

00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:41.352
I never expected

00:16:43.112 --> 00:16:44.072
I'd see you again

00:16:47.911 --> 00:16:49.432
in this lifetime.

00:16:54.072 --> 00:16:55.432
After ten years,

00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:00.192
we reunited here of all places,

00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:06.632
but under such circumstances.

00:17:08.952 --> 00:17:09.432
Youshou,

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.311
what's going on here?

00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:22.751
I was homeless

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:24.071
when I was a child.

00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:26.992
Young master and Madam saved me

00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:28.872
and brought me home.

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:30.912
I always thought

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.632
that you were simply

00:17:32.912 --> 00:17:34.511
from a wealthy family.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:51.751
But you were

00:17:52.392 --> 00:17:54.872
the former Crown Prince
and she was the late Empress.

00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:56.551
After Mother died,

00:17:57.992 --> 00:17:59.392
the Emperor sent assassins.

00:18:03.591 --> 00:18:04.511
Lord Dingyuan

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.791
saved me.

00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:10.551
- Run.
- Get him.

00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:23.271
(Xue Fugui, younger years)

00:18:23.271 --> 00:18:24.511
I'm Lord Dingyuan.

00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:25.736
Come with me.

00:18:25.952 --> 00:18:26.311
No.

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:27.751
Come with me.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.432
To conceal my identity
as the former Crown Prince,

00:18:32.472 --> 00:18:33.511
I dare not show up

00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:34.872
anywhere,

00:18:36.311 --> 00:18:37.351
let alone seek you out.

00:18:39.432 --> 00:18:40.111
I didn't expect

00:18:41.392 --> 00:18:41.912
that you'd

00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:45.152
become so skilled in martial arts.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:48.152
After the bandits attacked

00:18:48.872 --> 00:18:50.311
and we were separated,

00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:52.152
His Majesty rescued me

00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:54.271
and trained me.

00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:59.432
(They share childhood bonds.)

00:19:00.632 --> 00:19:01.751
(How can I compete?)

00:19:03.432 --> 00:19:04.351
As Youshou said,

00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:06.432
His Majesty must have

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.071
handpicked his personal guards

00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:10.751
who have clear family backgrounds.

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:13.511
He must know your history

00:19:14.031 --> 00:19:14.912
with Youshou.

00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:17.511
Hexu, are you saying that

00:19:18.912 --> 00:19:19.952
he orchestrated this?

00:19:20.751 --> 00:19:21.511
Isn't that obvious?

00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.152
He didn't tell you

00:19:24.952 --> 00:19:26.551
that your benefactor

00:19:27.712 --> 00:19:28.872
was the former Crown Prince

00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:31.791
and ordered you to kill him on purpose.

00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:33.311
Why would he

00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:35.071
do that?

00:19:39.392 --> 00:19:41.071
Had I actually killed young master,

00:19:42.311 --> 00:19:42.831
then...

00:19:43.311 --> 00:19:43.791
Yes.

00:19:44.712 --> 00:19:45.632
He'll reveal the truth

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.672
afterward.

00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:48.071
You'd commit suicide

00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:51.392
out of guilt.

00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:53.472
Then,

00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:55.831
no one will know

00:19:57.472 --> 00:19:58.952
of my existence.

00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:05.031
Those bandits

00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:06.791
were surely sent by him.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.232
They failed.

00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:10.511
So he trained Miss Feng

00:20:10.791 --> 00:20:11.712
into an assassin

00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:13.591
to come after you.

00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:16.672
Nothing poses a threat
as long as he kills

00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:18.351
the former Crown Prince

00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:21.031
and the Xue Guardians' leader.

00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:24.031
That's impressive.

00:20:24.912 --> 00:20:27.432
His strategic brilliance
is awe-inspiring.

00:20:29.031 --> 00:20:30.071
I once swore

00:20:31.872 --> 00:20:33.672
to protect you and Madam.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:35.791
But

00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:38.672
I could only watch

00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:40.071
as they took you away,

00:20:41.432 --> 00:20:42.672
unable to react.

00:20:45.551 --> 00:20:48.111
I vowed to tear your killers apart.

00:20:50.472 --> 00:20:51.432
However,

00:20:53.551 --> 00:20:55.031
the person I'd hate most

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:57.751
would be myself.

00:21:00.672 --> 00:21:01.232

Feng Zuoren.

00:21:15.992 --> 00:21:16.952
This isn't your fault.

00:21:18.031 --> 00:21:19.712
Your fate was never yours to control.

00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:22.392
First the former Crown Prince,

00:21:23.152 --> 00:21:23.672
now

00:21:24.392 --> 00:21:25.031
the Emperor.

00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:27.791
I nearly

00:21:29.632 --> 00:21:31.672
killed my own savior.

00:21:32.632 --> 00:21:33.551
You should be grateful

00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:34.912
that he sent you.

00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.392
Thanks to you,

00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:38.311
Youshou stands alive here.

00:21:38.872 --> 00:21:40.831
And you get the chance to turn the tide.

♪The world's weight

Feng.

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:47.591
Don't be foolish.

00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:49.511
Only when I'm gone

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:51.511
will all problems be resolved.

00:21:52.232 --> 00:21:53.392
I should have died.

00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:55.872
I struggled to survive

00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:58.432
just to see you again.

00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:00.952
Seeing you today,

00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:03.392
I have no regrets left.

00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.232
Young master.

00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:07.111
Feng.

00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:08.551
Hexu.

00:22:11.271 --> 00:22:12.351
Turn me in.

00:22:12.712 --> 00:22:13.152
No.

00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:15.511
I won't let you die.

00:22:15.912 --> 00:22:17.472
The Xue family and you are at risk.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:19.952
I can't remain a coward.

00:22:21.831 --> 00:22:22.992
Today, I realized that

00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:25.472
even if life and death part us,

00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:27.712
our souls remain connected.

00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:30.152
At the Naihe Bridge,

00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:33.111
I'll refuse Meng Po's soup.

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:35.511
I won't forget you, Feng.

00:22:35.672 --> 00:22:37.192
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:22:37.672 --> 00:22:38.952
I'll protect you

00:22:39.672 --> 00:22:40.511
at all costs.

00:22:42.232 --> 00:22:43.351
(If he dies,)

00:22:43.712 --> 00:22:45.192
(he'll become her eternal love.)

00:22:45.712 --> 00:22:46.791
I can't let you die.

00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:49.031
If one of us must die

00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:50.432
to protect the other,

00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:51.831
I'll go.

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:52.751
No.

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:54.031
I'll go.

00:22:54.192 --> 00:22:54.551
I'll go.

00:22:54.712 --> 00:22:55.071
I'll go.

00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:55.591
I'll go.

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:56.271
Enough.

00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:58.311
Since you won't let each other die,

00:22:58.751 --> 00:22:59.271
I'll go.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:22:59.952
Go ahead.

00:23:03.912 --> 00:23:04.912
I didn't mean it.

00:23:08.392 --> 00:23:09.232
Get some rest.

00:23:10.232 --> 00:23:11.071
You've rushed about

00:23:11.632 --> 00:23:12.351
all day.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:15.311
Youshou.

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:18.472
I meant to send you away,

00:23:19.712 --> 00:23:20.672
but not anymore.

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.472
The Xue Guardian commander
is here to protect you.

00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:31.192
Get some rest.

00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:32.952
Let's talk tomorrow.

00:23:35.992 --> 00:23:36.632
Youshou.

00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:39.751
Your cottage only has one bedroom.

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:40.751
How can we

00:23:41.192 --> 00:23:41.751
sleep here?

00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:43.751
You two share the room.

00:23:44.432 --> 00:23:45.111
I'll be outside.

00:23:45.311 --> 00:23:45.872
- No.
- No.

00:23:46.432 --> 00:23:47.392
How can a lady

00:23:47.712 --> 00:23:48.511
sleep outdoors?

00:23:49.632 --> 00:23:50.152
Exactly.

00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:51.111
Listen.

00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:52.751
Youshou and I will be out.

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:53.632
You stay.

00:23:53.952 --> 00:23:54.432
No way.

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:56.672
Stay inside,

00:23:56.872 --> 00:23:57.831
so I can protect you.

00:23:58.311 --> 00:23:59.472
Let's share the room then.

00:23:59.591 --> 00:24:00.111
- No.
- No.

00:24:06.712 --> 00:24:07.511
I'll take a walk.

00:24:21.791 --> 00:24:22.920
(I must accept punishment)

00:24:23.392 --> 00:24:24.311
(to protect)

00:24:24.872 --> 00:24:25.712
(young master.)

00:24:26.472 --> 00:24:26.872
Giddyup.

00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.591
Xue Hexu.

00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:32.632
Are you crazy?

00:24:33.392 --> 00:24:34.672
I could have

00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:35.912
killed you.

00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:37.152
But I had to

00:24:37.712 --> 00:24:38.432
block you.

00:24:38.831 --> 00:24:39.232
You...

00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:43.071
We always

00:24:44.311 --> 00:24:46.551
end up bickering like this.

00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:50.472
It won't happen again.

00:24:51.472 --> 00:24:52.591
We're both aiming to keep

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:54.432
young master alive.

00:24:56.791 --> 00:24:57.472
I never expected

00:24:58.551 --> 00:24:59.632
that all my efforts

00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:01.192
would never sway you,

00:25:02.432 --> 00:25:03.992
but his mere presence achieves it.

00:25:09.712 --> 00:25:10.551
I'm still alive

00:25:12.232 --> 00:25:13.152
because of him.

00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.632
It's time to repay him.

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:17.992
But think about it.

00:25:19.271 --> 00:25:19.912
If you die,

00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:21.544
who will protect him?

00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:23.632
Can you entrust him

00:25:24.551 --> 00:25:25.672
to anyone else?

00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:34.872
Feng Zuoren.

00:25:37.432 --> 00:25:38.152
Why can't you

00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:39.872
try to live for yourself?

00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:45.232
Liang is right there.

00:25:46.591 --> 00:25:48.672
It's a place full of possibilities.

00:25:52.271 --> 00:25:53.432
Don't you want to see it?

00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:56.031
Besides,

00:25:57.551 --> 00:26:00.152

with your beloved one.

00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:03.511

00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:11.551

You haven't expressed your love
under the blossoms.

You haven't embraced
beneath starlight's glow.

00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:26.071
