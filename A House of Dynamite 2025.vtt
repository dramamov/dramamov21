01:37.375 --> 01:39.666
Let us know
when you're at the ops building. Over.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.333
Six more months of your bullshit.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.208
I'm not…
I'm not trying to start problems with you.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.416
I'm just saying.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.250
No, I…

02:14.125 --> 02:17.125
All you had to do was wait six months,
and I would've been there to help.

02:24.666 --> 02:25.958
I got… I gotta go.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.458
But, listen, tomorrow
we can… we can figure this out.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.416
We can handle this whole situa…

02:31.666 --> 02:32.666
Hello?

02:33.458 --> 02:34.458
Hello?

02:46.416 --> 02:47.750
Just coming on the shift?

02:49.833 --> 02:52.583
-Sergeant, you get my email?
-No, sir.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.708
Well, there's an update from the top

02:56.708 --> 02:57.916
for today

02:59.500 --> 03:01.166
of the utmost importance.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.291
That's an order.

03:05.291 --> 03:07.250
-All right, sir.
-Mm-hmm.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.041
Think you'll keep making that joke?

03:09.125 --> 03:11.083
If you keep smiling, I'll keep making it.

03:12.750 --> 03:13.875
I hope not.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.416
How'd that go?

03:25.666 --> 03:27.083
Still working on it.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.333
But we should have
some movement on it today, hopefully.

03:32.791 --> 03:35.541
-The regs say no food or drink.
-All right, man.

03:35.625 --> 03:36.958
If you want one, just ask.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.458
Break's every four hours.
Next time, you can wait.

03:47.541 --> 03:51.250
-What's up your ass, man?
-And clean up your workstation.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.416
It's covered in grease and chips and shit.

03:55.666 --> 03:56.666
Yes, sir.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.333
Look at the dinosaur coming in the way.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.166
Wow. Aw.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.958
-Guys, guys, it's 3:30 in the morning.
-I'm sorry.

04:16.750 --> 04:17.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.708
How you feeling, conductor?

04:20.791 --> 04:22.666
-Mmm.
-How's he doing?

04:22.750 --> 04:25.333
Fever's gone up to 102.

04:25.416 --> 04:26.708
Oh gosh.

04:26.791 --> 04:29.500
-Come on. Let's get some shut-eye.
-Go to Daddy.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.166
-Come on.
-I love you.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.333
-Okay.
-I love you.

04:32.416 --> 04:34.333
I love you. Mommy's got her phone.

04:34.916 --> 04:35.875
What?

04:35.958 --> 04:38.125
-I can have him?
-Mm-hmm.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.666
-He's with me today?
-Mm-hmm.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.916
Thank you.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.208
-I love you.
-I love you too.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.500
I love you.

04:45.583 --> 04:49.000
-You wearing that to the White House?
-Yeah. It's, uh, Casual Friday today.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.583
-Thought so.
-Bye.

05:18.208 --> 05:19.208
Babe…

05:21.666 --> 05:22.750
I love you.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.291
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Morning.

05:46.791 --> 05:48.875
How are you, sir?
Can I see your badge, please?

05:50.416 --> 05:51.625
Thank you very much.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.458
Have a good shift.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.083
Keys.

06:00.666 --> 06:02.166
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Yeah.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.875
-Morning.
-Morning.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.208
-Here you go, sir. Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

06:36.291 --> 06:37.375
-Morning, Captain.
-Morning.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.000
Um, egg-white omelet, please.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.166
-Usual?
-Yeah, thanks.

06:42.375 --> 06:45.625
-So when did you start?
-Last week. How did you--

06:45.708 --> 06:49.500
Egg sandwich or oatmeal.
Anything else holds up the line. Thanks.

07:14.416 --> 07:15.583
-Morning.
-Good morning.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.666
-How's it going, man?
-Morning.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.375
-Good morning.
-Morning.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.500
-Morning.
-Good morning.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.583
-Quiet night.
-For you, maybe.

07:36.666 --> 07:39.375
-You're kidding. Little guy again?
-He'll be fine.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.791
-PLA exercise in an hour.
-Really?

07:41.875 --> 07:44.333
I thought they'd call it off
and try and lower the temperature.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.708
I guess they like it hot.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.583
-Right, anything from Pyongyang?
-Not since the last test.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.000
Saber-rattling or silence.
I'm not sure which worries me more.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.291
Well, add to it.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.541
NSA is itchy about an uptick in chatter
between Tehran and their proxies.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.708
-They want it flagged in the Morning Book.
-Consider their asses covered.

08:04.541 --> 08:05.666
What's that?

08:05.750 --> 08:08.416
Butte County. Over 100,000 homes at risk.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.833
That is not the feed.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.208
Same monitor was acting up yesterday.
We called systems.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.791
-Great. Bye.
-See you, Olivia.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.291
Hope the boy feels better.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.375
Sleep well.

08:17.208 --> 08:18.208
Oh!

08:18.291 --> 08:19.291
All right. Cheers.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.958
Cheers. Thank you.

08:23.916 --> 08:26.166
-Petty Officer Davis.
-Morning, ma'am.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.000
-Status update?
-On?

08:28.083 --> 08:29.916
Operation Don't Fuck This Up.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.500
I'm picking up the ring tonight.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.958
Bravo Zulu, sailor.
That took you long enough.

08:36.458 --> 08:38.458
-Right, morning, everyone.
-Morning.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.708
Book push is two hours. Let's get to it.

08:40.791 --> 08:42.416
-You got it.
-You got it.

09:02.916 --> 09:03.916
Rogers.

09:04.458 --> 09:09.375
No. He says the prenup is ironclad.
Those are the words he used.

09:10.291 --> 09:13.000
Well, I don't have time.
I don't have time to find another lawyer.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.916
Not if I wanna keep my job.

09:15.833 --> 09:18.625
Uh, I have to go. Goodbye. Thank you.

09:29.333 --> 09:33.041
At 0930, the president visits
a WNBA clinic for kids.

09:33.125 --> 09:35.333
Then we have the signing
of the Defense Omnibus bill

09:35.416 --> 09:36.958
with Hill leaders in the Roosevelt Room.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.958
We are pool for that.
Then three hours of executive time.

09:42.125 --> 09:42.958
Uh…

09:43.041 --> 09:47.000
…and the new Irish ambassador
is expected to stop by around 1600,

09:47.083 --> 09:48.958
so there may be an Oval spray.

09:49.041 --> 09:52.000
-And after that, it is a full lid.
-Thanks, Abby.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.166
Courtney's source at the UN

09:53.250 --> 09:55.833
says the White House may push
for more sanctions on Moscow.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.166
I haven't heard that yet,

09:58.250 --> 10:00.916
but, um, I will ask around.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.000
Uh, we got a quick alert, sir.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.500
-Quick alert.
-Alert.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.250
-From where?
-Pacific.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.833
SBX1 detects a ballistic launch.

10:22.916 --> 10:24.875
Confirm track. Yes, sir, we're seeing it.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.625
-Track on scope.
-Acknowledged.

10:26.708 --> 10:30.083
Vector 42.710, 137.14.

10:30.166 --> 10:35.250
Launch azimuth, 9.25 degrees.
Elevation angle, 66.79 degrees.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.166
Stand by for possible intercept.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.250
Copy that.

10:38.791 --> 10:41.333
-Right, log the time.
-Time is 0933.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.500
Initiate a national security
conference call.

10:43.583 --> 10:44.541
Copy.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.750
Patching in, and I am live.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.041
What's going on?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.208
STRATCOM's tracking a launch
over the Pacific.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.666
Second time since Christmas.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.458
-Uh, third.
-Right.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.166
Quarterly reviews. I was drowning.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.083
So give me a shoutout
if the world's going to end.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.041
-Yep.
-Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. Adding you now.

11:11.916 --> 11:12.916
Point of origin?

11:15.541 --> 11:17.291
Lieutenant, point of origin?

11:17.375 --> 11:19.291
STRATCOM says indeterminate.

11:19.375 --> 11:22.083
DSP satellites missed the launch.
Floating rig picked it up.

11:22.791 --> 11:24.083
DSP missed the launch?

11:24.166 --> 11:26.833
Doesn't matter who launched it.
Just that we knock it down.

11:26.916 --> 11:29.541
Doesn't look like we'll have to.
TPY-2 Japan reports

11:29.625 --> 11:32.125
flight vector is consistent
with previous DPRK tests.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.375
Hmm. Another yo-yo.

11:35.291 --> 11:37.750
Winslow's crew was on
when the last one popped up.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.125
Said they were filling out paperwork
for a week.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.916
Uh, Mrs. Holland? This is the whizzer.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.125
Sorry, ma'am. Chief Petty Officer Davis,
White House Situation Room.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.500
Is your husband available?

11:52.916 --> 11:55.166
-Did you see that ball game last night?
-Yes, sir.

11:55.250 --> 11:58.333
-Okay. Yes. Thank you, ma'am.
-You believe that Lindor?

11:58.916 --> 12:00.000
Impressive.

12:00.083 --> 12:03.125
Apparently, the national security advisor
took a healthy hit of propofol.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.000
-Oh. Lucky him.
-Colonoscopy.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.416
-Call the deputy.
-Morning.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.750
-Pleasure to see you. You ready?
-Where the hell's Holland?

12:10.583 --> 12:11.958
Dr. Holland's indisposed, sir,

12:12.041 --> 12:15.791
but we've got Deputy National Security
Advisor Baerington with us.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.166
-He'll be with you shortly.
-It'll be over by then.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.458
-I'm gonna start.
-Go ahead, Tony.

12:20.541 --> 12:24.958
Approximately three minutes ago,
we detected an ICBM over the Pacific.

12:25.041 --> 12:29.000
At this time, we haven't determined
if the launch was land or sea-based,

12:29.500 --> 12:33.083
but the object's trajectory
is consistent with previous tests,

12:33.166 --> 12:36.666
and we expect splashdown
somewhere in the Sea of Japan.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.083
-Greely Ops Center.
-Greely Ops Center.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.500
Stand by. We're confirming.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.208
-Lieutenant Collins.
-Yes.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.166
Greely Ops Center.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.708
Where are we starting out now?

12:56.791 --> 12:59.166
-Sensor operator.
-Sergeant Diaz here.

13:01.416 --> 13:04.458
-We're connected to STRATCOM?
-Yeah, looks like another test.

13:04.541 --> 13:06.541
Greely Ops Center. Sergeant…

13:07.791 --> 13:09.041
What is it, Sergeant?

13:09.541 --> 13:12.291
Uh, clear radar acquired our object, sir.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.875
Wait. And?

13:14.958 --> 13:18.083
Uh, rate of ascent slowing.
Inclination is flattening.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.416
Velocity?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.500
It's steady, sir.
Six kilometers per second.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Wait. Is Cheyenne Mountain seeing this?

13:26.791 --> 13:29.375
Are you kidding?
This guy's big break. He's out for a walk?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.333
-A block away.
-Not good enough.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.250
Guys, let's keep working
the phones, everyone.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.458
If it is another test,

13:34.541 --> 13:37.541
I want a note within the hour
summarizing regional reaction.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.458
Aye, Captain.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.166
-You better get back on.
-Yep.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.000
Sorry about that. Seems we have an update.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.666
Current velocity indicates

13:47.166 --> 13:49.791
that the object will go suborbital.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.708
Current flight trajectory is consistent

13:53.791 --> 13:56.708
with impact somewhere
in the continental United States.

13:56.791 --> 13:58.083
Holy shit.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.583
What's your level of confidence
on that, Tony?

14:03.875 --> 14:07.958
Not an error. We're tracking it
on multiple radar systems now.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.833
I'm told… Hi, Jerry.
…we have dual phenomenology on the track.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.166
Nineteen minutes to impact.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.791
Ma'am, I… I don't understand.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.666
Add SECDEF and POTUS to the call.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.833
Now, Davis.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.083
-Were you listening to that?
-I was.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Get to it.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.416
Check the shot doctrine.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.916
State Department, yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.125
Repeat that to me.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.500
-Authenticate.
-Uh…

14:42.666 --> 14:43.791
Uh…

14:45.125 --> 14:46.166
-Uh…
-Here. Here.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.000
Oscar, Foxtrot, four, niner, one, six.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.666
Sergeant, you're doing fine.
We've trained for this a million times.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.791
You're good.

14:53.875 --> 14:57.083
Oscar, Foxtrot, four, nine, one, six.
Order is authentic.

14:59.541 --> 15:00.833
I'm sorry, say again.

15:07.708 --> 15:10.375
We have weapons-release authority
to launch our GBIs.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.250
Confirm DEFCON 2.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.875
Holy shit.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.958
-Down to two.
-Currently, we are at DEFCON 2.

15:24.041 --> 15:27.500
-Are you looking at this?
-DEFCON 2. I repeat, DEFCON 2.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.916
-Have we seen DEFCON 2 before?
-No.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.416
Hey, I know this isn't my business,
but it seems really serious.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.208
I'm sorry.
I can't give you any information.

15:35.291 --> 15:39.583
Everyone, relax, okay? A rounding error.

15:39.666 --> 15:42.083
This is still
a commercial satellite launch.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.916
Some billionaire forgot to file
the right paperwork, send his email.

15:46.000 --> 15:46.833
Okay, focus.

15:46.916 --> 15:49.416
POTUS is on campus.
Mr. Watts has been notified.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.041
-Adding SECDEF now.
-Great.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.208
SIGINT indicates Moscow
is aware of the launch.

15:53.291 --> 15:57.500
Atypical DPRK activity along the DMZ
could be an unannounced rotation,

15:57.583 --> 15:58.833
but they're not picking up.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.333
Could this be the PLA exercise?

16:00.416 --> 16:03.000
Maybe Davis staged it
so he could put off proposing?

16:03.083 --> 16:06.041
-Hey, not now.
-Exercise was surface warfare only.

16:06.125 --> 16:06.958
No SSBNs.

16:07.041 --> 16:10.500
USS Ford reports multiple J-15s
now launching from the Fujian.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.166
-We expect that?
-We ever know what the Chinese are doing?

16:14.208 --> 16:15.041
Huh?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.833
I mean, a car just backfired.
People are spooked.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.000
I'd be more worried if they weren't.

16:20.666 --> 16:21.750
Okay, what else?

16:22.250 --> 16:24.875
Exercise could've been cover
for a preemptive strike.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.416
By sending one warhead at us?

16:26.500 --> 16:30.041
-That's like suicide by nuclear cop.
-All right, that's enough. That's enough.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.666
-Keep verifying.
-Our job is not to solve the puzzle.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.291
It is to find the pieces,
send it up the chain, okay?

16:35.375 --> 16:37.875
Principals need hard facts,
not speculation.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.541
You find those, you raise your hand.

16:39.625 --> 16:40.875
-Speak up.
-Yes, sir.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.416
-Yes, sir.
-We got this.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.458
Signature analysis.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.166
Check out the exhaust plume.

16:50.250 --> 16:53.583
-It's not good, sir.
-We've run this drill a thousand times.

16:53.666 --> 16:56.416
-You wanna get it up?
-Let's get STRATCOM up on the wall.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.958
-Um… not sure.
-I know.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.916
Sixteen minutes to impact.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.125
-Okay. All right, everybody.
-Set an alarm.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.041
Let's keep dialing, then.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.458
Russia and China's lines are busy.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.375
-Embassies?
-Nothing but tone.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.208
-Right. You tried UN missions?
-Course.

17:18.291 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, the whole world's
calling each other at the same time.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.666
-Keep dialing. Just try it.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.583
Shelter in place.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.500
Shelter in place.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.541
Shelter in place.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.583
Shelter in place.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.291
Shelter in place.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.708
Confirming. Clamshell's open.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.041
Showing launch status green.

17:43.916 --> 17:46.833
Showing launch status green.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.083
Do we have a COG responsibility here?

17:55.791 --> 17:58.291
My understanding was
we initiate on launch.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.166
Get people moving.
Can we get a legal opinion on that?

18:01.250 --> 18:02.916
I'm not sure that's right, Reid.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.708
In fact, I'm damn near certain
the president has COG.

18:05.791 --> 18:07.833
Well, I'm issuing the order.

18:08.333 --> 18:12.208
Plenty of time to sort it later,
and if you're gonna start moving people,

18:12.291 --> 18:14.500
we don't wanna be caught
with our pants down.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.125
I have an updated impact estimate.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.583
Go ahead, Tony.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.333
Low probability. Louisville, St. Louis.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.833
Medium. Chicago, Indianapolis.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.916
High. Cleveland, Columbus.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.208
That's primary, of course.
Still assessing the prevailing winds.

18:31.291 --> 18:32.791
Jesus Christ.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.208
-No fucking way.
-Can I get my phone?

18:35.291 --> 18:37.000
No, we have to stay here.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.000
Walker, is this real?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.833
This is in from STRATCOM.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.375
Did you say Chicago?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.500
Uh, yes. In the medium bucket.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.583
Yes. Yes, this is the White House
Situation Room. Hold, please.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.541
I need a Mandarin translator.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.875
-Get him un-busy.
-State.

18:50.958 --> 18:55.000
-Yeah. My hands are a little full here.
-I have the vice premier of China on hold.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.666
-Tice.
-Good shit. Need you on two. Mandarin.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.833
We have a probability of impact happening.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.375
White House Situation Room.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.958
We have Louisville, St. Louis
also possible targets.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.458
Hey, we're, uh, ordering Sweetgreen today.
You want?

19:15.541 --> 19:18.541
-Nah, think I'm gonna go out.
-Okay.

19:24.666 --> 19:25.666
Oh.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.708
Hey, Izzy, did you hear anything
about a drill today?

19:32.208 --> 19:33.541
Not that I know of.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.166
Shelter in place.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.041
Shelter in place.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.958
Shelter in place.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.208
Shelter in place.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.666
Sir, the missile field is clear.

19:50.750 --> 19:51.583
Copy.

19:51.666 --> 19:54.541
Target is coming into
the intercept window in three,

19:55.208 --> 19:57.250
two, one.

19:57.916 --> 19:59.791
-Activate launch.
-Launch activated.

20:18.666 --> 20:20.958
GBI2 and GBI4 are airborne.

20:21.041 --> 20:24.833
EKV release in 3 minutes 17 seconds.
Stand by for course adjustment.

20:24.916 --> 20:28.291
Is there anyone that can
do better than shot-in-the-dark guesses?

20:28.375 --> 20:31.125
We're not handicapping
the fucking Army-Navy game.

20:31.208 --> 20:34.458
-Uh, Mr. President?
-Yes. Who's that?

20:34.958 --> 20:37.208
This is Jake Baerington, sir.

20:37.291 --> 20:41.750
Uh, we actually met briefly
before the, uh, G8 last year.

20:42.833 --> 20:43.791
Uh…

20:45.208 --> 20:47.833
If someone could…
If… if we could get Anna Park.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.583
She's the national intelligence officer
for the DPRK.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.166
She'll have a more informed view on
North Korean intentions and capabilities.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.125
Okay, so how do I talk to her?

20:56.208 --> 20:58.083
Ma'am, I got FEMA operations on line one.

20:58.666 --> 20:59.958
FEMA? Now?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.666
I'm going to find out. Yeah. I'm sorry.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.208
Have you seen this?

21:05.916 --> 21:07.000
Excuse me.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.500
Uh…

21:12.166 --> 21:15.166
-The whizzer's on.
-I couldn't connect it to your office.

21:15.666 --> 21:19.916
This is, uh, Cathy Rogers with the Office
of National Continuity Programs.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.041
I'm trying to find someone
who can tell me what the hell is going on.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.166
How so?

21:25.166 --> 21:29.458
Well, we received instructions to initiate
our Joint Emergency Evacuation Plan.

21:29.541 --> 21:30.375
Right. And?

21:30.458 --> 21:33.208
And, what, you expect the speaker
of the house to make a run for it

21:33.291 --> 21:34.958
without having a few questions first?

21:35.041 --> 21:37.208
No, I don't know
what the speaker of the house--

21:37.291 --> 21:40.625
Are you telling me
we're at war all of a sudden?

21:42.125 --> 21:43.166
With who?

21:43.250 --> 21:46.416
The only thing I can do,
I can confirm the JEEP order's authentic.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.625
-Thank you.
-Admiral Miller?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.208
-That's me.
-We need to move you to the PEOC, sir.

21:52.375 --> 21:56.666
Okay, well, we all just can't leave.
We need to make an orderly transition.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.750
Get the flyaway team to Raven Rock.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.583
Not everyone. Just you,
Gordon, Caldwell, and Stern.

22:01.666 --> 22:03.583
Those are the names I have
on the COG list.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.166
Okay.

22:05.250 --> 22:09.250
One moment.
Uh, I mean, this is ridiculous.

22:09.333 --> 22:10.333
It's…

22:11.666 --> 22:13.500
Okay. Liv.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.125
-Yep.
-Everyone back to it.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.500
You get off?

22:20.583 --> 22:21.625
You should go.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.375
-Me? No.
-Yes. Just in case.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.291
Come on. That's not how this works.

22:26.791 --> 22:30.375
No, the president's gonna call the bunker.
He's gonna expect you to answer.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.958
He can't pick me out of a lineup. Come on.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.750
Besides, GBI's gonna
take this thing right out, right?

22:36.833 --> 22:38.166
If it's even real.

22:39.916 --> 22:43.708
Hey, didn't the Soviets
mistake a flock of birds for ICBMs once?

22:43.791 --> 22:44.916
The sun.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.875
'83. High-altitude clouds.

22:50.041 --> 22:52.166
-It's a sunny day, sir.
-Sir.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.625
I have instructions
to physically escort you.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.875
I've got it, okay?

22:57.958 --> 22:58.958
Come.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.208
Gordon, let's go.

23:03.291 --> 23:04.375
Yes, sir.

23:06.791 --> 23:07.875
Do your thing.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.958
Right. Everyone, let's stay focused.

23:18.750 --> 23:19.875
Let's do what…

23:22.041 --> 23:25.000
what we do best, right?
President still needs us.

23:30.750 --> 23:34.458
Hey, buddy. Can you hold tight
for just a second? Just…

23:36.833 --> 23:37.708
Hey.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.666
-Hi. Me again.
-I'm so sorry.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.208
-We're so busy today.
-I get it.

23:46.041 --> 23:46.916
Come on.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.083
Sorry.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.000
Uh, if the doctor can't see him today,

23:51.083 --> 23:53.666
can he just write him a prescription
or something like that?

23:54.666 --> 23:56.125
I'll have to ask.

23:58.458 --> 24:00.500
Fuck.

24:04.666 --> 24:05.500
Shit.

24:20.916 --> 24:23.166
Hey, hon. Um…

24:23.250 --> 24:24.875
Is anything going on up there?

24:25.666 --> 24:29.083
I… I don't know. Anything… unusual.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.958
Shelter in place.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.291
Shelter in place.

24:34.375 --> 24:37.458
-Stand by EKV release.
-What the fuck is going on, sir?

24:37.541 --> 24:39.625
You saw what happened.
We launched our GBIs.

24:39.708 --> 24:42.041
-Your ass should be in the bunkers.
-Yes, sir.

24:42.666 --> 24:44.000
EKV status?

24:44.791 --> 24:47.625
-Bring up the space-based kill assessment.
-Stand by.

24:48.125 --> 24:51.708
Three, two, one,

24:52.208 --> 24:53.125
release.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.958
First EKV released.

24:58.041 --> 25:00.833
Velocity ten kilometers per second.
Closing in on target.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.791
Second EKV has failed to separate.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.708
I'm sure it is a mistake, Mr. Leader,

25:15.791 --> 25:20.208
and we'll turn you around right away
as soon as we confirm that.

25:20.291 --> 25:21.791
It didn't… it didn't work.

25:22.416 --> 25:23.375
Failed.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.208
-One EKV left.
-What's the status of the GBIs?

25:26.291 --> 25:27.875
Second EKV failed to launch.

25:27.958 --> 25:31.583
-The first EKV is currently still inbound.
-Why don't we launch more?

25:32.125 --> 25:35.000
We have fewer than 50 GBIs
in our entire arsenal.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.208
We're gonna need them
if they fire more missiles at us.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.750
If someone fires more,
aren't we all fucked anyway?

25:40.250 --> 25:43.916
The kinetic energy of one single EKV
colliding with an incoming warhead,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.291
it's over 100 million joules.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.875
-It'll vaporize it.
-Yeah.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.291
This is gonna be over in a minute, right?

25:52.291 --> 25:54.708
End of our shift,
we're gonna be on our way home. You…

25:54.791 --> 25:58.166
Look at me. You're gonna have a stop
at that little jewelry store, right?

25:58.666 --> 26:01.166
When you look back at this drama,
what, this is gonna be

26:01.250 --> 26:03.958
the second most exciting thing
that happened to you today.

26:05.666 --> 26:06.666
Right?

26:07.708 --> 26:08.708
Right.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.541
Yeah.

26:18.958 --> 26:22.958
Uh, the senator just got up and left
in the middle of the hearing?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.250
-EKV adjusting course.
-Twenty-one seconds.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.125
You okay, Sergeant?

26:34.166 --> 26:35.875
Put up STRATCOM's audio.

26:38.916 --> 26:40.250
Ten seconds.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.833
Nine.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.291
-Eight. Seven.
-Listen, before, with the chips--

26:45.375 --> 26:47.416
-We're good, man. I'm a slob.
-Six. Five.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.791
To hell with her.
Shouldn't have left it like that.

26:50.375 --> 26:51.375
Three.

26:52.000 --> 26:52.916
Two.

26:53.791 --> 26:54.791
One.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.125
Confirm impact.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.583
-Confirm impact.
-Stand by. Confirming.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.083
Hold.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.375
-Come on. What are you waiting for?
-I just…

27:20.083 --> 27:21.166
It's negative.

27:22.958 --> 27:23.958
Oh shit.

27:24.666 --> 27:25.875
Fuck.

27:26.416 --> 27:27.333
I, uh…

27:27.416 --> 27:30.041
-Yes, negative impact.
-Negative impact.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.291
Object remains inbound.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.875
We did everything right, right?

27:45.208 --> 27:46.208
Right?

27:47.500 --> 27:50.000
We did every fucking thing right.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.625
Mr. President, confirming DEFCON 1, sir.

27:53.708 --> 27:54.750
Oh my God.

27:55.291 --> 27:57.875
Oh Jesus. We just went DEFCON 1.

27:57.958 --> 27:59.208
Okay.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.458
Confirming.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.583
-Okay.
-Negative impact.

28:07.958 --> 28:11.125
Major, confirm the release
of two additional GBIs to intercept.

28:12.708 --> 28:13.791
Major.

28:15.166 --> 28:16.666
Major… Danny.

28:16.750 --> 28:17.583
Danny?

28:18.583 --> 28:20.416
Danny, we gotta launch again, right?

28:24.333 --> 28:26.375
Pull it up. Come on. Come on. Pull it up.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.250
Target is past apogee
and entering terminal phase, sir.

28:35.541 --> 28:37.958
I… I have
an updated flight trajectory, sir.

28:39.708 --> 28:40.708
Chicago.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.166
Why the hell is that book out?

28:46.250 --> 28:49.458
Mr. President, significant time
and expertise were devoted

28:49.541 --> 28:51.083
to designing these options.

28:51.166 --> 28:54.458
You'll find a range,
select, limited, and major,

28:54.541 --> 28:57.708
depending on the scale of the response
you feel is warranted.

28:57.791 --> 29:00.916
I suggest you allow
Lieutenant Commander Reeves to brief you.

29:01.416 --> 29:02.416
Fuck.

29:06.583 --> 29:07.583
Thank you.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.750
Most of the Iron Gate list is on the move,
but they are not happy.

29:13.833 --> 29:14.833
Any word?

29:16.916 --> 29:17.750
Mike.

29:18.250 --> 29:21.625
What's our casualty estimate
for a nuclear strike on Chicago?

29:21.708 --> 29:22.708
What?

29:23.833 --> 29:26.041
Seriously? This is starting
to piss me off.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.666
-They should give more--
-Goddamn it.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.291
What is it, Cathy?

29:29.791 --> 29:33.458
Ten million, primary.
Another 10% downwind.

29:58.583 --> 30:00.416
What are you doing? Hey.

30:20.291 --> 30:22.375
Russia, finally.
Foreign minister for the president.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.333
Great.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.625
Sir, this is Captain Olivia Walker,
ranking officer on duty.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.625
I will connect you with the president.

30:30.708 --> 30:33.166
-I can't… I can't merge the calls.
-What? What do you mean?

30:33.250 --> 30:35.250
POTUS is on the NC3.
Russia's on the hotline.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.166
-He'd drop off, then we'd dial him in.
-So? Can you do that?

30:38.250 --> 30:41.375
We risk losing contact. He's on the move.
Plus the time it takes.

30:41.458 --> 30:44.666
STRATCOM is asking for
our launch instructions for retaliation.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.875
-Like, right now.
-Okay. All right.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.333
Sir, we're having technical issues
with the president.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.125
I'm gonna get you someone
who can speak for him right now.

30:54.208 --> 30:55.083
Please hold.

30:55.583 --> 30:58.666
Billy, I want you to go and get my cell.
Get yours too.

30:59.166 --> 31:00.375
-Ma'am.
-Just go.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.416
Why are we launching?

31:01.500 --> 31:03.708
Quickly. I'm asking you.
I can handle this.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.416
Not sure. You'll have to try DOD.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.000
Who's in charge there? Can you put him on?

31:10.083 --> 31:12.666
Gail, can you monitor the NSCC?

32:17.541 --> 32:20.208
-Hello?
-Hey, Mom. Um…

32:20.708 --> 32:22.458
Yeah, no, everything's, uh…

32:26.291 --> 32:28.875
Yeah, no, no, I'm good.
I promise you I am…

32:29.375 --> 32:30.458
I'm doing great.

32:32.041 --> 32:33.625
Okay.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.291
Yeah, no, I'm, uh…

32:37.791 --> 32:39.583
Yeah, I'm working hard. I'm

32:40.958 --> 32:42.208
doing my best.

32:47.125 --> 32:48.125
Yeah.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.958
No, I just… I just wanted to call you
and, you know,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.166
tell you I love you.

32:55.916 --> 32:56.791
Aw.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.000
All right. I'll… I'll call you later. Um…

33:04.083 --> 33:06.250
Yeah, I gotta go.
They're calling me right now.

33:22.708 --> 33:25.125
They've got five minutes.
How far is anyone gonna get?

33:25.208 --> 33:27.041
They can at least shelter in place.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.083
Do you think hiding under desks
is gonna help them?

33:29.166 --> 33:31.708
There's a car outside.
Driver says you're on some kind of list.

33:31.791 --> 33:33.458
-"Hasty Access."
-Who's downstairs?

33:33.541 --> 33:34.916
Some guy's here to take Cathy.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
-I'm a DE, Mike.
-What does that mean?

33:41.625 --> 33:43.250
Designated evacuee.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.208
It means
she gets to ride this out at Raven Rock.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.750
You chose me as your alternate.

33:49.666 --> 33:52.875
There's no threat to DC. There might not
even be a threat to Chicago.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.708
She's barely done her job for a month.

33:55.541 --> 33:57.250
Why does she get to be rescued?

34:00.875 --> 34:01.750
Come on.

34:03.916 --> 34:06.375
-He's checking in.
-I'll update you when we get there.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.083
Yeah. Come on. We're moving out.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.916
Hey, what's going on up there?
Where's everyone going?

34:15.000 --> 34:18.083
Try his secretary! Somebody!
Secretary, I don't give a…

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Go home.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.541
Beijing Station reports
the PSC is convening an emergency session.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.416
Yes. Yes,
I can get that for you right away.

34:48.166 --> 34:51.208
-Situation Room. Walker.
-Put me back on the NSCC.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.958
-Is it Russia's?
-He denied it.

34:53.041 --> 34:55.958
Said it might be Pyongyang. But he swears
they had nothing to do with it.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.000
Why are they mobilizing?

34:57.083 --> 34:58.958
They're seeing our B-2s go airborne.

34:59.041 --> 35:01.125
Now put me back on the fucking conference.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.250
Look. Look, as I told you,
I am not fully briefed yet,

35:13.333 --> 35:15.625
but I promise
I am doing my best to chase it down.

35:15.708 --> 35:17.166
You don't know why he bailed?

35:17.250 --> 35:19.916
-Is the president in Washington?
-Look, I…

35:20.000 --> 35:21.333
A military hero…

35:21.416 --> 35:22.791
Where should we go?

35:22.875 --> 35:25.458
The American public deserves
to know what's happening.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.375
Excuse me.
Sorry. Do you know what's going on?

35:27.458 --> 35:28.625
You should leave if you can.

35:28.708 --> 35:29.791
Are the American--

35:29.875 --> 35:31.291
-Sorry.
-Where are you going?

35:31.375 --> 35:32.875
What is happening?

35:38.041 --> 35:43.000
Yes, we've got Governor on line two,
and we're merging the calls now.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.291
Thank you for your patience.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.125
Raven Rock is asking for
names and serial numbers

35:54.208 --> 35:55.791
of everyone still here on duty.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.875
Socials for civilians in case…

35:58.916 --> 36:02.583
If it's just Chicago, it's just Chicago,
but if we fire back…

36:02.666 --> 36:04.083
They need a dead list.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.416
Thanks.

36:30.375 --> 36:33.166
Yes. We have the governor on the line.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

36:38.916 --> 36:39.750
Come on.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.458
All right, Liam. Watch your head, bud.
Watch your--

36:42.541 --> 36:44.541
I wanna do it by myself.

36:44.625 --> 36:46.625
Okay. Okay.

36:48.750 --> 36:49.875
-Hey.
-Listen to me.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.708
Get Liam, get in the car,
and just start driving.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.375
Where? What are you talking about?

36:54.458 --> 36:58.791
West. Go west. Go west as fast as you can.
Get away from any urban centers.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.958
-Liv, what the fuck? What's going on?
-Listen.

37:01.041 --> 37:05.375
I'll call you. I love you. I love you.
Can you kiss Liam for me? Just kiss him.

37:06.083 --> 37:07.125
Bye, bye, bye.

37:13.750 --> 37:14.583
Okay.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.041
-Miss Rogers?
-Yes. Yes.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.750
-Sir, your nuclear forces are ready.
-They'll wait, right?

38:16.916 --> 38:19.083
To see what happens before they retaliate.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.708
What if he doesn't come back on?

38:23.375 --> 38:24.791
Decapitation event.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.333
We find the vice president…

38:27.250 --> 38:31.291
-Any chance this lands in Lake Michigan?
-A lot of times, they don't even detonate.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.791
All right, I'm here.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.750
-You'll need your SAS card, sir.
-Oh.

38:37.333 --> 38:38.583
It's in here somewhere.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.666
Right.

38:41.166 --> 38:43.291
Reminds me of when I was in college.

38:46.375 --> 38:48.250
You just, uh, read it aloud.

38:49.083 --> 38:49.958
Hey.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.833
-November, Delta, Oscar.
-Come here.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.208
-One, one, one, seven.
-It's okay.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.750
November, Delta, Oscar.

38:59.833 --> 39:03.083
One, one, one, seven.

39:04.833 --> 39:07.208
National command authority confirmed.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.833
Your orders, Mr. President?

40:35.833 --> 40:37.166
-Steve.
-General.

40:37.250 --> 40:41.083
Goddamn! Lindor is a great shortstop, man.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.875
Tell me you watched
that All-Star game, please.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.666
Let your boys stay up that late?

40:46.583 --> 40:49.583
-Yours give you a choice?
-No. No, they do not.

40:55.875 --> 40:57.083
Call to arms!

40:57.708 --> 40:58.833
Fire!

41:04.083 --> 41:05.958
Ready!

41:06.041 --> 41:07.375
Fire at will!

41:24.833 --> 41:26.625
-This is awesome.
-Uh-huh.

41:26.708 --> 41:31.208
Well, 50,000 deaths in three days.
Awesome is one word.

41:55.625 --> 41:58.333
This is the DDO
at the National Military Command Center

41:58.416 --> 42:01.791
with a top-secret SCI
national security conference

42:01.875 --> 42:03.750
for missile launch indications.

42:03.833 --> 42:05.958
All conferees, please stand by.

42:17.541 --> 42:18.875
J3, are you tracking this?

42:18.958 --> 42:21.541
I don't remember anything
from the ops and intel briefing.

42:21.625 --> 42:24.000
It's news to me, Dan. I'll look into it.

42:37.666 --> 42:40.041
-Did you see that?
-On it.

42:41.333 --> 42:44.666
EDBC Whisper. Tracking
inbound ICBM in the Pacific theater.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.125
Attention on deck.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.875
Morning, everybody.
Please take your seats.

42:50.958 --> 42:53.666
-Morning, sir.
-What's the situation?

42:54.791 --> 42:57.125
Sir, missile-launch indications
in the Pacific theater.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.708
The DDO's standing up
a national security conference.

43:00.958 --> 43:03.625
Sir, no update yet,
but I'm hoping to have one soon.

43:08.166 --> 43:10.791
-Did you see that ball game last night?
-Yes, sir.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.500
You believe that Lindor?

43:14.041 --> 43:15.083
-I mean…
-Impressive.

43:15.166 --> 43:17.916
He is unbelievable.

43:21.583 --> 43:23.208
Yep, it's all good news.

43:28.458 --> 43:29.458
Okay.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.083
Okay, I'll tell him.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.708
Love you.

43:37.458 --> 43:40.166
My mom wants to know
if you're going to Helsinki next week.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.458
She must have…

43:42.208 --> 43:44.208
must have seen it
on The View or something.

43:44.708 --> 43:46.291
No. No, I won't be there,

43:46.375 --> 43:48.833
but the briefing I wrote has
a really nice first-class seat,

43:48.916 --> 43:49.750
so that's great.

43:49.833 --> 43:52.333
If you're really not that happy,
I can talk to Marty.

43:52.416 --> 43:55.458
No, don't talk to Marty.
Staff director's a lateral move.

43:55.541 --> 43:59.083
-I can't go back to the Hill. It's a, uh…
-Hmm.

43:59.166 --> 44:01.291
-It's just…
-It's what?

44:02.875 --> 44:05.208
-It's a bad idea…
-Mmm.

44:05.750 --> 44:09.666
…to be working in such close proximity
to my radiant wife.

44:09.750 --> 44:13.500
You think that she'll inherit
your capacity for ass-kissing bullshit?

44:13.583 --> 44:15.916
Sorry.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.583
Hey, it… uh, it's Jake.

44:21.416 --> 44:22.416
Yeah.

44:26.750 --> 44:27.625
Bye.

44:33.666 --> 44:37.458
The DSP satellite system
is generally reliable,

44:37.541 --> 44:41.416
but that will obviously be a focus
of our after-action.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.666
So the launch could've been
land or sea-based?

44:43.750 --> 44:46.291
No, the DPRK don't have
an SSBN capability.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.208
That we know of.

44:47.291 --> 44:49.750
Beijing's been wanting
to test their Jin-class boats.

44:49.833 --> 44:50.708
Eight sugars, please.

44:50.791 --> 44:52.916
And we've been tracking
three Borei-class subs

44:53.000 --> 44:55.125
out of Vladivostok since last week.

44:55.208 --> 44:57.208
On top of their push into the Atlantic,

44:57.291 --> 44:59.208
I can't see 'em risking more sanctions.

44:59.291 --> 45:01.875
Uh, sir, on the, uh, North Korean front--

45:01.958 --> 45:04.625
-Who is that?
-Jake Baerington, sir.

45:04.708 --> 45:06.041
Dick Holland's deputy.

45:06.125 --> 45:08.125
There's a reason
I didn't join the Navy, son.

45:08.208 --> 45:10.250
All that bouncing around's
making me seasick.

45:10.333 --> 45:13.041
I'm sorry, sir. I just, um…
I'm almost at the White House.

45:13.125 --> 45:14.458
I just wanted to say,

45:15.125 --> 45:18.333
well, we do know that the KPA
have been chasing sub capabilities,

45:18.416 --> 45:21.916
okay, and previous leaps
in booster design and TELs

45:22.000 --> 45:23.750
have gone undetected till rollout.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.666
Mr. Baerington? All due respect--

45:25.750 --> 45:26.958
-Thank you.
-Hello?

45:27.541 --> 45:28.625
Mr. Baerington?

45:29.916 --> 45:31.500
Did we lose him?

45:31.583 --> 45:32.791
Mr. Baerington?

45:32.875 --> 45:34.000
Hello? Sir?

45:37.041 --> 45:37.958
Fuck.

45:39.875 --> 45:40.875
Sir.

45:42.208 --> 45:44.583
I do think we need to upgrade
our salvage operations.

45:44.666 --> 45:47.583
We're leaving potentially valuable
intelligence on the ocean floor--

45:47.666 --> 45:48.666
Sir.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.375
Uh, excuse me a moment. What?

45:55.458 --> 45:56.750
No way that's right.

45:57.416 --> 45:58.791
NORTHCOM confirms.

45:59.291 --> 46:01.291
Fort Greely's preparing to launch GBIs.

46:01.375 --> 46:04.333
That's right, Tony.
I've authorized weapons-release authority.

46:13.083 --> 46:15.875
Um, sorry about that.
Seems we have an update.

46:17.541 --> 46:21.291
Current velocity indicates
the object will go suborbital.

46:22.583 --> 46:24.375
Current flight trajectory is consistent

46:24.458 --> 46:27.500
with impact somewhere
in the continental United States.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.083
Holy shit.

46:30.166 --> 46:32.125
What's your level of confidence
on that, Tony?

46:35.166 --> 46:36.333
It's not an error.

46:36.416 --> 46:39.041
We're tracking it
on multiple radar systems now.

46:40.250 --> 46:44.291
I'm told… Hi, Jerry.
…we have dual phenomenology on the track.

46:45.125 --> 46:46.958
Nineteen minutes to impact.

46:48.583 --> 46:50.541
Confirming DEFCON 2.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.083
We have a confirmed
hostile launch, everyone.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.666
Initiate phase one.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.375
OPLAN 8044, revision 25.

46:59.458 --> 47:01.583
-Stand by, all commands.
-Yes, sir.

47:01.666 --> 47:02.791
What is our target?

47:03.291 --> 47:05.333
My team's doing everything they can…

47:09.500 --> 47:11.166
Have you found POTUS yet?

47:12.958 --> 47:15.416
Okay, when you find him, patch him in.
Keep calling.

47:18.541 --> 47:20.541
Can I have 15 seconds?

47:35.375 --> 47:38.083
You gonna bring something back
every time we forward deploy?

47:38.666 --> 47:40.250
'Cause you're creating an expectation.

47:40.333 --> 47:42.875
He's three. He has no expectations.

47:42.958 --> 47:43.958
Exactly.

47:44.791 --> 47:47.750
Sometimes he wakes up, Daddy's gone.
Sometimes Daddy's home.

47:47.833 --> 47:51.333
Listen to him, kid.
It's the benefit of two marriages talking.

47:51.416 --> 47:52.833
Third time's the charm.

47:55.708 --> 47:57.625
…with no warning whatsoever.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.958
-We need to speak with someone who can--
-Of course, Mr. Secretary.

48:01.041 --> 48:02.958
Jake, how's Lily doing?

48:03.041 --> 48:05.416
-Sorry, I'm on a…
-Well, tell her I said hi.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.958
In the meantime,
we've raised our alert status.

48:08.583 --> 48:11.291
After last month's test launch,
we forward-deployed a number of B-2--

48:11.375 --> 48:12.625
Hello? Uh…

48:12.708 --> 48:17.458
Sir, I'm sorry, I think, um…
I think we got disconnected for a minute.

48:17.541 --> 48:19.333
I think we should reconsider that, sir.

48:19.416 --> 48:21.416
Reconsider what exactly?

48:21.500 --> 48:22.375
Well…

48:22.875 --> 48:25.333
By, uh… Go for it.

48:25.416 --> 48:27.500
By moving to DEFCON 2, sir,

48:27.583 --> 48:30.166
we are potentially risking
a spiral of alerts.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.541
Spiral of what?

48:32.166 --> 48:34.416
Jake? Where the hell's Dick?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.375
Spiral of alerts, Mr. Secretary.

48:36.458 --> 48:38.625
And, uh, Dick's out of pocket right now.

48:38.708 --> 48:41.583
But… when we increase our readiness--

48:41.666 --> 48:43.416
-Sir.
-Yeah.

48:43.500 --> 48:44.916
…all of our adversaries do the same,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.250
believing we're preparing to take
offensive action ourselves.

48:49.333 --> 48:52.041
Okay, what we need to do,
we need to communicate with them.

48:52.125 --> 48:55.333
-We need to… we need to explain our--
-Then communicate.

48:55.958 --> 48:57.375
That's your job, not mine.

48:58.250 --> 49:02.208
You have someone you can call who will
tell us just what the hell's going on?

49:02.291 --> 49:04.000
Don't let us hold you back.

49:04.083 --> 49:06.166
-Sir, put your phone in the tray.
-Just one sec.

49:06.250 --> 49:08.083
-I don't have one sec.
-Yeah.

49:08.166 --> 49:11.375
I'm sorry. Sorry, General.
I… I wasn't talking to you, sir.

49:11.458 --> 49:14.125
Then who in the hell were you talking to?

49:14.875 --> 49:17.000
Do we have an ETA for POTUS yet?

49:17.083 --> 49:18.583
I'm told imminent.

49:18.666 --> 49:22.875
It occurs to me,
do we have COG responsibility here?

49:23.583 --> 49:26.083
I'll be taking your questions
at the later briefing this morning,

49:26.166 --> 49:28.208
so if you can just hold them until then.

49:30.166 --> 49:31.250
Sorry.

49:31.333 --> 49:33.541
Sorry. Excuse me.

49:34.916 --> 49:36.541
We still waiting on POTUS?

49:38.458 --> 49:39.500
What do you think?

49:40.541 --> 49:41.833
I'd be guessing.

49:41.916 --> 49:43.333
Where the hell is POTUS?

49:43.416 --> 49:44.625
North Koreans.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.416
Fuel shortages. Crop failures.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.500
Maybe they're more desperate
than we thought.

49:50.666 --> 49:51.708
B-2s are sortieing.

49:51.791 --> 49:54.916
Or it's Moscow, and they want us to think
it's the North Koreans.

49:56.666 --> 49:58.666
Moscow knows we'll retaliate.

49:58.750 --> 49:59.750
Do they?

50:00.916 --> 50:02.791
Assassinating dissidents
wherever they please.

50:02.875 --> 50:05.250
Imprisoning Americans. Ukraine.

50:05.750 --> 50:08.875
And what? We confiscate
a few of their yachts in Saint-Tropez?

50:10.125 --> 50:12.500
A single, unattributed strike

50:13.000 --> 50:14.083
sows chaos,

50:14.583 --> 50:16.000
puts us on our heels,

50:16.500 --> 50:19.750
and it gives them an opportunity
to see if they can get away with worse.

50:19.833 --> 50:21.791
Gives everyone that opportunity.

50:23.750 --> 50:27.833
Or some fucking sub captain woke up,
found out his wife left him, and snapped.

50:27.916 --> 50:29.750
-Yeah.
-Told you I'm guessing.

50:30.250 --> 50:31.083
Sir.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Battle gram.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.000
Updating our target package.

50:37.250 --> 50:39.625
We're still trying
to ascertain that for you, sir.

50:39.708 --> 50:42.208
Greely better not fuck this up.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.833
I have an updated impact estimate.

50:47.333 --> 50:48.375
Go ahead, Tony.

51:08.750 --> 51:11.958
-Hey, when are we home again?
-1700 next Tuesday.

51:12.041 --> 51:14.916
You think I can meet this girl
at the Applebee's before they close?

51:15.000 --> 51:18.500
-You take your dates to Applebee's?
-She works there, dumbass.

51:39.541 --> 51:41.541
Jesus Christ.

51:42.416 --> 51:46.125
This is why we have the GBIs.
No need to panic people.

51:46.208 --> 51:47.833
Did you say Chicago?

51:47.916 --> 51:50.666
Uh, yes. In the medium bucket.

51:51.916 --> 51:53.875
My daughter lives in Chicago.

51:55.250 --> 51:59.708
Sir, our GBIs
will be airborne momentarily.

51:59.791 --> 52:01.083
This is what we do.

52:02.500 --> 52:03.666
Jake, you still there?

52:03.750 --> 52:04.750
Yes, sir.

52:05.333 --> 52:08.500
What are the chances this works?
Knocking it down.

52:09.083 --> 52:11.333
-General Brady should answer.
-I'm asking you.

52:11.416 --> 52:13.875
-Yes, but--
-I know what he's gonna say.

52:13.958 --> 52:15.416
And I want the truth.

52:18.208 --> 52:20.583
I should stay in my lane, sir,

52:21.083 --> 52:23.916
but… …honestly…

52:24.000 --> 52:27.625
Interceptors have launched.
Everyone, interceptors have launched.

52:28.333 --> 52:31.125
…it depends on the circumstances.

52:31.875 --> 52:34.583
Okay, when we… when we test…

52:37.500 --> 52:39.125
When we test, we can't control--

52:39.208 --> 52:40.625
Cut the bullshit, damn it!

52:43.833 --> 52:45.750
Once the kill vehicle separates,

52:45.833 --> 52:49.250
our midcourse intercept system
has a success rate of 61%.

52:53.833 --> 52:55.416
So it's a fucking coin toss?

52:56.250 --> 52:58.791
That's what $50 billion buys us?

52:58.875 --> 53:01.291
We are talking about
hitting a bullet with a bullet.

53:01.791 --> 53:04.333
Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me?

53:04.416 --> 53:07.041
Mr. President, let's get you up to speed.

53:07.916 --> 53:11.791
Attention on the flight line.
Attention on the flight line.

53:11.875 --> 53:13.875
Ground crew to hangar three.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.875
Prep Ghost 1 for launch.

53:17.958 --> 53:20.166
-This your office?
-Yeah.

53:20.250 --> 53:21.750
I need you to come with me, sir.

53:32.583 --> 53:34.750
Fuel gauges checked!

53:35.250 --> 53:37.833
Flight controls.

53:42.750 --> 53:43.958
Munitions loaded.

53:53.416 --> 53:55.708
Down the hall. Sir, we gotta move.

53:56.583 --> 53:59.333
-Sir, is everything okay?
-Gotta get to the elevator.

53:59.416 --> 54:02.208
-Marty, where are you going?
-Sir, we gotta get going now.

54:02.875 --> 54:03.708
Let's go.

54:41.958 --> 54:44.375
-Could be a mistake.
-On our end or theirs?

54:44.458 --> 54:45.458
Who are they?

54:45.541 --> 54:48.041
-Deputy NSA arriving.
-This way, sir.

54:49.208 --> 54:50.208
Hold on.

54:50.291 --> 54:54.791
What I'm asking is, what are the odds
this is an intentional strike?

54:54.875 --> 54:57.541
The odds, I'd put them at 75%.

54:58.125 --> 55:00.000
I'd say 80%.

55:00.083 --> 55:02.083
All due respect, I'm closer to 50-50.

55:02.166 --> 55:05.541
Okay, is there anyone that can
do better than shot-in-the-dark guesses?

55:05.625 --> 55:08.083
We're not handicapping
the fucking Army-Navy game?

55:08.166 --> 55:09.666
-Uh, Mr. President.
-Yes.

55:09.750 --> 55:12.875
-Who's that?
-This is, uh, Jake Baerington, sir.

55:12.958 --> 55:17.500
Um, we actually met briefly
before the, uh, G8 last year.

55:18.375 --> 55:19.208
Uh…

55:21.750 --> 55:24.166
If someone could…
If… if we could get Anna Park.

55:24.250 --> 55:26.916
She's the national intelligence officer
for the DPRK.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
She'll have a more informed view

55:29.083 --> 55:30.958
on North Korean
intentions and capabilities, sir.

55:31.041 --> 55:33.166
Okay, so how do I talk to her?

55:33.250 --> 55:35.166
We're getting her for you,
uh, Mr. President.

55:35.250 --> 55:37.458
Company men, ready!

55:38.375 --> 55:39.500
Fire!

55:43.291 --> 55:44.708
Wow!

55:49.666 --> 55:51.291
I'm gonna have to call the office.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.875
-Hello?
-Hey, Anna. It's Jake.

55:55.958 --> 55:59.333
-Jake. I just got a JEEP alert.
-You're on an NSCC with the president.

55:59.416 --> 56:01.958
-I'm sorry, what?
-Hey, Miss Park.

56:02.041 --> 56:03.416
It's the president.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.250
I understand that you're…
you're the expert.

56:06.333 --> 56:10.250
There was a launch, Anna,
about ten minutes ago. Not a test.

56:10.750 --> 56:11.916
Okay, we need answers.

56:12.416 --> 56:16.375
Starting with could the DPRK have
an SSBN capability we don't know about?

56:16.458 --> 56:19.583
And how likely is it that the regime
would initiate a strike like this?

56:20.875 --> 56:22.958
A launch? I mean…

56:23.791 --> 56:25.625
Jake, I'm sorry. I'm off today.

56:25.708 --> 56:28.041
-Okay? I'm not even…
-Anna, what the… Where are you?

56:28.125 --> 56:29.666
-What the hell?
-Gettysburg.

56:29.750 --> 56:30.875
Anna.

56:32.125 --> 56:34.208
Please, this is real.

56:35.208 --> 56:38.541
I can't answer either question
with certainty, but yes,

56:38.625 --> 56:42.166
they've absolutely been seeking
a sea-based launch capability.

56:42.250 --> 56:45.250
They deployed a modified Romeo-class sub
two years ago

56:45.333 --> 56:48.166
carrying ten short-range cruise missiles.

56:48.250 --> 56:51.041
But why? Why… why would they do this?

56:51.125 --> 56:53.750
The regime's primary motivation
is self-preservation.

56:53.833 --> 56:55.291
Wouldn't that discourage?

56:55.375 --> 56:58.500
Sir, they may believe
they can survive a retaliatory strike.

56:58.583 --> 57:01.583
Which, given their dispersed command
and control and mobile-launch system,

57:01.666 --> 57:03.333
yes, it's entirely possible.

57:03.416 --> 57:07.375
And then negotiate relief for themselves.
Um, no more launches in exchange for aid.

57:07.458 --> 57:09.375
They think they can blackmail us?

57:09.458 --> 57:12.083
If you're losing a board game,
you might as well topple it.

57:12.166 --> 57:14.708
Miss Park,
this is General Brady at STRATCOM.

57:14.791 --> 57:16.708
Last time I checked,

57:17.208 --> 57:20.250
Moscow's not exactly
winning the game either.

57:20.333 --> 57:24.125
You're not wrong, sir.
The Russians are stretched and cornered.

57:24.208 --> 57:26.833
They've been coordinating
more closely with Beijing.

57:26.916 --> 57:29.791
They've grown far more aggressive
with their sub deployment.

57:30.291 --> 57:33.083
Where exactly in the Pacific
did the launch originate?

57:33.166 --> 57:35.250
We can't be precise, ma'am.

57:35.333 --> 57:37.458
DSP satellites missed it.

57:37.541 --> 57:38.958
You're fucking kidding?

57:39.041 --> 57:42.125
Why the hell does that matter?
We're tracking them now, aren't we?

57:42.208 --> 57:44.250
Yes, uh, Mr. President, we are.

57:44.333 --> 57:47.166
It's just that blinding a DSP satellite,

57:47.250 --> 57:49.708
it could indicate
that we've been compromised.

57:49.791 --> 57:52.041
A cyber penetration
of our command-and-control systems.

57:52.125 --> 57:53.583
Seven, eight…

57:53.666 --> 57:57.375
Which would strongly suggest
a sophisticated, coordinated assault

57:57.458 --> 57:59.000
that is only just beginning.

57:59.083 --> 58:01.000
There's no hard evidence of that.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.375
We'd need more information.

58:02.458 --> 58:06.083
The Chinese navy has been experimenting
with AI-assisted launch systems,

58:06.166 --> 58:09.041
so this could be a technical mishap.

58:09.125 --> 58:12.166
All right, that's enough
of this. This is a waste of time.

58:12.250 --> 58:14.791
Sir, a… a cyber expert could potentially--

58:14.875 --> 58:17.875
Yeah, well, find one, okay?

58:17.958 --> 58:20.416
EKV has separated from the first GBI.

58:21.416 --> 58:22.625
One minute to intercept.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.291
-Aiden!
-Boo!

58:25.416 --> 58:27.000
Ma'am, I'm disconnecting you now.

58:27.083 --> 58:29.708
-Okay.
-If you have a JEEP alert, get moving.

58:29.791 --> 58:31.375
Mom? What happened?

58:35.708 --> 58:37.333
Left! Right!

58:37.416 --> 58:38.916
Right! Right!

58:39.000 --> 58:41.208
Left! Right!

58:45.375 --> 58:47.583
At ease!

58:48.583 --> 58:49.916
Ten seconds.

58:50.791 --> 58:51.791
Nine.

58:52.375 --> 58:53.541
Eight.

58:53.625 --> 58:55.333
-Seven.
-Before, with the chips--

58:55.416 --> 58:57.541
-We're good, man. I'm a slob.
-Six. Five…

58:57.625 --> 58:59.916
To hell with her.
Shouldn't have left it like that.

59:00.416 --> 59:01.500
Three.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.458
-Two.
-Yeah.

59:04.083 --> 59:05.083
One.

59:13.875 --> 59:15.041
Confirm impact.

59:18.166 --> 59:20.500
-Confirm impact.
-Stand by. Confirming.

59:24.583 --> 59:26.375
What are you waiting for?

59:29.666 --> 59:31.333
-It's negative.
-What'd he say?

59:32.333 --> 59:33.625
What did he say?

59:34.666 --> 59:35.666
I, um…

59:36.875 --> 59:38.250
Negative impact.

59:39.375 --> 59:40.875
Object remains inbound.

59:46.125 --> 59:49.291
Like Baker said… coin toss.

59:51.583 --> 59:54.166
We did every fucking thing right.

59:54.250 --> 59:57.166
Mr. President, confirming DEFCON 1, sir.

59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.250
Oh Jesus. We just went DEFCON 1.

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:02.416
Confirming.

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.041
What now, sir?

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.750
There is no plan B.

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.250
Yes, it's a negative.

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:25.583
-What do we do now?
-I don't know. I don't know.

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:26.833
Yes, confirming.

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.375
Sir, Black Book's available.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.291
Why the hell is that book out, son?

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:53.750
Mr. President, significant time
and expertise were devoted

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:55.541
to designing these options.

01:00:55.625 --> 01:00:59.375
You'll find a range,
select, limited, and major,

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:02.291
depending on the scale of the response
you feel is warranted.

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:05.500
I suggest you allow
Lieutenant Commander Reeves to brief you.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.291
Three 055 Renhai-class destroyers
on the move.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:13.041
Jesus Christ. I got action in Khorramabad.
Sirens in Tel Aviv, sir.

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:14.958
Everybody knows we missed.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:19.583
Mr. President, we're seeing
some concerning activity

01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:21.666
from our adversaries
on a number of fronts.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.083
More concerning
than a goddamn nuclear launch?

01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:29.000
Sir, the USS Virginia reports
it's just lost contact with its shadow,

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:32.708
one of four Russian submarines
we're tracking in the North Atlantic,

01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:36.333
each presumably armed with 16 SLBMs.

01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:39.375
Until we know differently,
we have to assume this may get worse.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:43.000
General Brady, I know
everyone's trying to do their jobs here,

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.250
but we need to slow the fuck down.

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:47.625
President's right.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.833
There's no way
he can make an informed decision

01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:51.333
under these circumstances.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.791
Mr. President, Mr. Baerington,

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:57.000
slowing down is one luxury
we just don't have.

01:01:57.708 --> 01:01:59.625
These are the circumstances.

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:03.833
In little more than seven minutes,
we will lose the city of Chicago.

01:02:03.916 --> 01:02:05.750
I can't tell you why.

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:09.833
Or why we're seeing
North Korea, Russia, China,

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:13.458
Pakistan, and even Iran
raising their alerts

01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:16.875
and mobilizing their forces
across air, land, and sea.

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:20.916
Perhaps, as Mr. Baerington
suggested earlier,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.833
they are simply and innocently
responding to our posture.

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:26.416
It is also possible

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.833
that they've seen our homeland
is about to absorb a catastrophic blow,

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.500
and they are readying
to take advantage of that.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:37.333
Or this is all part of
a phased, coordinated assault,

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:38.833
with far worse to come.

01:02:38.916 --> 01:02:40.416
I simply don't know.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.791
What I do know is this.

01:02:42.875 --> 01:02:48.375
If we do not take steps
to neutralize our enemies now,

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:51.125
we will lose our window to do so.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.375
We can strike preemptively,

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:57.333
or risk 100 ICBMs launching our way,

01:02:57.416 --> 01:03:01.083
at which time,
this war will have already been lost.

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:07.375
And if there is no war?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.833
If this is it?

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:13.958
I think we'd all welcome
any indication of that.

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:17.375
As unfathomable as it was
just five minutes ago,

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:19.666
I'd accept the loss
of ten million Americans

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.833
if I could be absolutely certain
it stops there.

01:03:22.916 --> 01:03:27.250
Of course, in absence of that certainty,
we can all certainly say a prayer

01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:31.750
and rely on the goodwill
of our adversaries to keep us safe.

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:36.416
Or we can hit their command centers,
silos, and bombers

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.291
while they're still on the ground,

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:42.333
eliminating their ability
to take further action against us.

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:47.833
We've already lost
one American city today.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.625
How many more do you wanna risk?

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.333
What kind of question is that?

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:56.416
-This is insanity, okay?
-No, sir.

01:03:58.458 --> 01:03:59.958
This is reality.

01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:01.833
Six minutes to impact.

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:05.208
It's Walker. She's got
the Russian foreign minister on the line.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:06.791
We can't merge the calls.

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.250
Jake.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.958
Sit room has
the Russian foreign minister on the line,

01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:15.000
but we cannot merge the call.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.500
You need to pick up and take it.

01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:21.625
It has to be you.

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:24.208
Okay?

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:28.333
The president needs a reason
not to retaliate, okay? You give him one.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.416
-You ready?
-Yeah.

01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:34.250
Let's go.

01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:37.458
This is Jake Baerington.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:41.208
-I'm the deputy national security advisor.
-You authorized to speak?

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:44.583
I'm authorized to do whatever's necessary
to de-escalate this situation, sir.

01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:48.875
Your bombers are airborne.
What kind of de-escalation is that?

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:50.291
Mr. Foreign Minister,

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:52.708
you have to understand
that's only a precaution.

01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:55.458
Okay, our country is about to be hit

01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:58.708
by an entirely unprecedented
and unprovoked attack.

01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:00.875
Which we had nothing to do with.

01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.333
Do I have your word?

01:05:02.416 --> 01:05:05.333
Can I assure the president
that Russia has nothing to do with this,

01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:08.625
they're not behind the launch,
and you will not seek to capitalize?

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:09.708
Yes.

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:11.875
And do I have your word

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.875
that you won't use it as an excuse
to wipe us out?

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:18.166
-That's ridiculous.
-Is it?

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.708
You might tell your president,

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:24.458
if your forces do not stand down,
we will be compelled to respond in kind.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:28.083
You have a sub off our coast
that just slipped its shadow.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:31.208
Order it to the surface
to identify its location

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:32.625
as a show of good faith.

01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:34.791
So you can wipe it out of the water?

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:37.333
We are running out of time,

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:39.083
and my wife is six months…

01:05:41.666 --> 01:05:42.666
Jake.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.458
I'm sorry. Um…

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.750
Jake?

01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:49.625
Listen, if we get this wrong,

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.458
none of us are gonna be alive tomorrow.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:55.125
Now, if you're telling me
that you didn't do this,

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.541
and I believe you,

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.541
then I can promise you
we will not hit any Russian targets.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:03.958
Can you promise me you will stand down
your long-range strategic assets?

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:06.958
Better. There'll be no retaliation at all.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.125
I completely agree.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:11.208
And I will push for that,
but that is not my decision, sir.

01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:13.208
If you do retaliate,

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:18.000
can you guarantee that your response
will not infringe on our airspace?

01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:25.000
With our bombers, yes, of course.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:26.333
And missiles?

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.916
If you determine that, God,
fucking China is responsible--

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.083
-Sir, there…
-Tell the truth.

01:06:32.791 --> 01:06:33.625
No.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:39.666
Sir, we both know
that there would be some overflight.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:41.166
There's no way around that.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.916
And you expect us to simply trust

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.250
that warheads flying over our head
are not destined on our cities?

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:50.041
Hopefully, sir,
there will not be any warheads.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.541
If there are, then, yes,
I'm asking you to trust me.

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:00.666
Trust.

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:02.666
Why?

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:06.250
-I'll talk to my president.
-What if, um--

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.875
Darkstar, this is Ghost 1.

01:07:15.958 --> 01:07:17.625
Approaching loiter position.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.750
Ghost 1-1, Darkstar. Picture clean.

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.458
Stand by mission data package.

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:32.666
Is this right?

01:07:33.625 --> 01:07:35.833
Darkstar, Ghost. MDB confirmed.

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:40.333
Ghost, Darkstar. Stand by execution order.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:45.250
Forward-deployed B-2s
are at loitering position.

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.833
Mr. President,
we're going to need your decision.

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:51.750
Lieutenant Commander Reeves
is your strike advisor

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.500
and can walk you through
the authentication process.

01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:59.000
Then you'll need to read aloud
an attack option designation--

01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:01.500
Yeah. Look,
I understand all that, all right?

01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:03.708
Reid, I need you.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:06.833
What do you think, Reid?

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.708
We're close to take off.

01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:10.000
Did we lose him?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.541
Sir! No, no, no, no, sir!

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:14.833
Holy shit!

01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:16.916
-What was that?
-All right.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.541
Mr. President?

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.375
-It's Jake again, sir. Baerington.
-Keep your seats. Keep your seats.

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.500
I spoke to the Russian foreign minister.

01:08:23.583 --> 01:08:26.958
He denies their responsibility
for the launch.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:30.750
Said he spoke to Beijing,
and he doesn't think it was them either.

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:35.916
-I believed him, sir.
-You did?

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.666
-They gonna back down?
-Sir, I think that they want to.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.416
And if we can guarantee
that we will not retaliate,

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.875
I think I can, uh…

01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:48.416
we can convince them.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.041
-What does that mean?
-We don't launch.

01:08:51.958 --> 01:08:53.250
Against anyone.

01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:55.000
For now, at least.

01:08:55.083 --> 01:08:57.833
What, we just sit back
and watch Chicago incinerate?

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:01.666
Are you fucking kidding me? Do you think
the American people are gonna go for that?

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:04.625
Sir, the… the warhead,
it might still malfunction.

01:09:04.708 --> 01:09:06.333
They do that sometimes.

01:09:06.416 --> 01:09:08.666
Did he agree to these terms?

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:12.291
All right, we do nothing,
they back off for certain?

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.375
-More or less.
-More or less?!

01:09:14.458 --> 01:09:15.875
-Jake.
-Yes, sir.

01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:17.833
I'm gonna need you to breathe.

01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:19.041
I'm breathing just fine, sir.

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:22.666
Good 'cause my job is
to make this decision. I wish it weren't.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:26.375
And your job is to tell me
exactly what he agreed to.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.166
-No bullshit. Can you do that?
-He didn't agree to anything, sir.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.083
He said
he needed to speak with his president.

01:09:32.583 --> 01:09:35.041
Sounds to me like we know nothing new.

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:37.833
Wrong, General. If we do what he's asking,

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:40.000
if we hold back,
there's at least a chance.

01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:41.541
Two minutes and 30 seconds.

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:44.583
Jake, Jake, I do what you're suggesting,

01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:48.041
I let whoever did this get away with it.

01:09:48.541 --> 01:09:50.500
How is that any different
from surrendering?

01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:52.541
Sir, if you wanna look at it that way,

01:09:53.166 --> 01:09:55.500
then I'm telling you your choices are

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.083
surrender or suicide.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.000
Uh…

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.666
We gonna need a minute.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.333
So what now? What are we doing?

01:10:14.416 --> 01:10:16.041
Now I call Fort Belvoir.

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:18.666
Put the Army Corps of Engineers
on standby.

01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:22.583
In case the White House gets hit
and they need to dig us out.

01:10:22.666 --> 01:10:23.625
Oh God.

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:25.666
-Serious?
-That's the plan.

01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:29.000
There's a plan for this?

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:40.375
If this order comes through…

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.375
I know my job, sir.

01:11:00.166 --> 01:11:05.291
Romeo, Bravo, Juliett, Whiskey,
Delta, Foxtrot, Echo.

01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:07.333
Missilization order is authentic.

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:10.500
Romeo, Bravo, Juliett,

01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.125
Whiskey, Delta, Foxtrot, Echo.

01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:14.583
I concur with missilization.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:16.791
Three, two, one. Turn.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:18.750
Sir, standing by for fire order.

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:22.083
Sir, your nuclear forces are ready.

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:24.791
-Sir, B-2s are at loiter.
-Yes, sir.

01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:27.083
Missile field status green.

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:28.916
What if he doesn't come back on?

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.041
Decapitation event.
We find the vice president.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:37.958
If we can't reach him, speaker.
Right on down the list.

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:39.166
I'm here.

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:42.916
-You'll need your SAS card, sir.
-Oh.

01:11:45.708 --> 01:11:47.208
It's in here somewhere.

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:49.125
Right.

01:11:50.041 --> 01:11:51.916
Reminds me of when I was in college.

01:11:54.958 --> 01:11:57.208
You just, uh, read it aloud.

01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:02.500
November, Delta, Oscar.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
One, one, one, seven.

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:08.500
November, Delta, Oscar.

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:11.541
One, one, one, seven.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.833
National command authority confirmed.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.458
Your orders, Mr. President?

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.375
My orders?

01:13:01.416 --> 01:13:03.708
You sure you don't want any coffee? Water?

01:13:04.208 --> 01:13:05.625
No, thank you, ma'am.

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:24.166
Betty, can you get us the majority leader?

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.750
Quickly, please. Thanks.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.500
Already 45 minutes late.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:35.416
POTUS for majority leader, please.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.333
Thank you.

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:04.625
That's looking more like it.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.208
Nope.

01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:25.125
Out playing nine.

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:28.041
It's going, I guess.

01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:31.958
Last time I was around all these uniforms,
I was a private.

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:34.500
They're still full of shit.

01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:42.500
Thanks, George. I appreciate that.

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:46.375
We were lucky to have 33 great years.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:49.875
Meant the world you and Sheila
came to the funeral.

01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:54.458
Okay, talk later.

01:14:58.875 --> 01:14:59.875
Sir.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Sir.

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.208
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.583
Let's knock this in now.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:16.833
Hey. I was hoping to catch you.

01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:20.625
-I wish you were here to see this.
-Yeah? Is it going good?

01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:23.708
They say anything
that raises awareness helps.

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:26.291
-Okay.
-You sound tired.

01:15:26.791 --> 01:15:28.583
No. Um…

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:30.208
I'm fine.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:35.083
My husband, the only politician
who can't lie to save his life.

01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:36.958
Okay. I'm fucked.

01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:39.208
You know, didn't they, uh,

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.791
promise that, uh,

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:44.125
we'd get used to it after a while?

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:47.083
"Worse than the campaign."
I think that's what I remember.

01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:49.666
I think they said
it would break us, actually.

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.750
Oh, speaking of,
we have to talk about my mother.

01:15:53.666 --> 01:15:56.333
Now the doctor's saying
she needs full-time help.

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.458
Hello? Are you there?

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:03.958
It's not just me. It's the doctor.

01:16:04.041 --> 01:16:07.875
Okay. I mean, you know.
Let's do it when you come back, all right?

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:10.458
It's not fair that you got
the save-the-elephants high ground.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:12.875
I always have the high ground.

01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:15.666
-And don't you forget it, buddy.
-You all right though?

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:16.666
-Huh?
-Hey.

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:18.875
-You… you okay?
-Fine.

01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:21.041
Can you hear me?

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:27.375
Hello?

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.333
Hon, can you hear me?

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:34.416
Bruce, what do we have, uh,

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:36.291
now?

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:37.666
-Basketball, sir.
-Oh.

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:42.166
-Is that, uh, Angel Reese still?
-Yeah, with the kids.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.541
-You ready for that?
-Of course.

01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:46.333
You been shooting around a little bit?

01:16:46.416 --> 01:16:48.666
-You got a jump shot?
-Do I have a jump shot?

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:49.958
-Yeah.
-Little one.

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:52.041
-Maybe.
-Show me.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:55.791
-Like, you wanna see it?
-Don't sh… No, Bruce, no.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:57.375
-Okay.
-Hey, Betty.

01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.250
Can you, uh…

01:17:01.166 --> 01:17:06.500
Can you ask the, uh, guy
to put the insole in this thing?

01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:09.666
-It slipped out again?
-Just, I don't know what's going on.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.500
Oh God.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:12.125
What's the name
of the school that, uh… the class?

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:15.916
-The Jump Shot Girls Basketball Camp, sir.
-Jump Shot. Jump Shot.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:19.708
-How's your jump shot, Ken?
-It's not bad, sir.

01:18:20.625 --> 01:18:21.666
How about yours?

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:23.750
I don't have the knees.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:35.750
After the budget signing, I've
slotted some prep time for the hearing.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.791
-Oh, which one is that?
-House Oversight.

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:40.166
-Red Sea shipping task force.
-Right.

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:42.208
Sure.

01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:44.416
Okay.

01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:46.791
Whose ass am I kissing first?

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.083
Senator Cunningham. Democrat. Connecticut.

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:51.708
He supported the additional funding
from the start.

01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:56.166
This is Secretary Baker.

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:16.875
Icon arriving.

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:21.958
How's my tie?

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:23.833
Looks good, sir.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:27.208
All right.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.416
Mr. President. Mr. President.

01:19:31.958 --> 01:19:34.583
Who's your favorite WNBA star, sir?

01:19:39.333 --> 01:19:41.583
Mr. President, how's it going today?

01:19:42.166 --> 01:19:43.250
Feeling good.

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:47.958
Mr. President, I look forward
to shooting around.

01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:51.500
Mr. President, who has
a better three-point shot, you or Angel?

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:54.708
That's a… Is that a trick question?

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.166
Trying to set me up. Okay. I know.

01:19:59.041 --> 01:20:00.458
Do you think you can take her?

01:20:00.541 --> 01:20:04.000
-One more question for you.
-I don't know about that.

01:20:06.041 --> 01:20:07.375
All right.

01:20:09.541 --> 01:20:11.500
The hurt doesn't show

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.583
But the pain still grows…

01:20:13.666 --> 01:20:17.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

01:20:18.958 --> 01:20:20.250
How's everybody doing?

01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:24.500
I can feel it
Coming in the air tonight…

01:20:24.583 --> 01:20:27.750
How's it going? How you doing?
Good to see you. Good to see you.

01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:30.208
How you doing? Nice to see you.

01:20:30.291 --> 01:20:33.416
I've been waiting for this moment

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.541
For all my life…

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.958
What's up, man? How you doing?

01:20:40.458 --> 01:20:43.958
I can feel it in the air tonight

01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:46.125
Oh Lord

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.666
-Oh Lord
-Good. Good to see you. All right.

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:52.166
And I've been waiting for…

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.500
-Hey, Angel.
-Hey.

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:54.583
I came to play.

01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:57.166
-It's an honor to have you.
-Really good to meet you.

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.791
Hey, everybody.
Put 'em up. Let's go. Let's go.

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:04.083
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:07.833
Oh, you want… Me?

01:21:07.916 --> 01:21:08.875
Me?

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:10.250
Come on.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.291
Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see.

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:15.000
Oh!

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:18.083
One more. One more.
Okay, one more. Let's see.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.416
I'm just warming up, okay?

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.125
-Take your time.
-Mm-hmm.

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:32.083
-That was good. That was good.
-That was good.

01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.833
Well, it's really nice to be here.
I'm really glad to be here.

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:37.000
How's it feel
to have the morning off school?

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.416
Feel good? Let me see your shot.
You got a shot for me?

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.833
Go ahead. Let me see the ball. Let's see.

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.291
Oh!

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:54.625
That's great. I'll have my office
call over with some dates.

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:57.208
-Reviewed. Here are my notes.
-Thanks, Senator.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:22:00.000
-Let's get ready to present.
-Sir, whizzer's on the line.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:06.333
-You can use your SAS card.
-Sure. Okay.

01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:13.083
-This is Secretary Baker.
-Authenticate, sir.

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:15.791
Bravo 19416.

01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:18.583
They said I gotta
teach you something, and I'm…

01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:21.208
I'm not gonna teach you to shoot.
I know you can do that.

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:25.750
But, uh, I wanna tell you a little story
about how sports helped change my life.

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:29.375
Growing up, I wasn't athletic
like… like Angel here.

01:22:29.458 --> 01:22:31.500
I wasn't athletic.
I couldn't play football.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.166
I hear you're rotating out next month.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.375
My mom and pop had, you know, a store…

01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:37.750
Back to Omaha.

01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:41.250
I bet you're gonna miss this.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:45.458
-Standing around while the star performs.
-Show me your shot. Go ahead.

01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:48.125
He took his time, see?

01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:49.750
Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:52.708
Now…

01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:54.625
This is my third.

01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:59.208
They're all chronically late narcissists.

01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:02.166
At least this one reads the newspaper.

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.208
My understanding was
we initiate on launch.

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:09.000
Get people moving.
Can we get a legal opinion on that?

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:11.666
Yeah, I'm not sure that's right, Reid.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:14.583
In fact, I'm damn near certain
the president has COG.

01:23:14.666 --> 01:23:17.000
Well, I'm issuing the order.

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:20.916
Plenty of time to sort it later,
and if you're gonna start moving people,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.333
I don't wanna be caught
with our pants down.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:25.375
I have an updated impact estimate.

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:26.833
Go ahead, Tony.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.208
Low probability. Louisville, St. Louis.

01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:33.000
Medium. Chicago, Indianapolis.

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.791
High. Cleveland, Columbus.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:39.333
That's primary, of course.
Still assessing the prevailing winds.

01:23:39.416 --> 01:23:40.666
Jesus Christ.

01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:45.208
This is why we have the GBIs.
No need to panic people.

01:23:45.708 --> 01:23:47.291
Did you say Chicago?

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:50.041
Uh, yes. In the medium bucket.

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:53.291
My daughter lives in Chicago.

01:23:53.375 --> 01:23:55.625
If our country's gonna fix
the world's problems,

01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:57.583
we're gonna have to work together.

01:23:58.083 --> 01:24:02.458
-Teamwork, as we have been talking about.
-Hello?

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:07.208
I also think
that I won't get to play for Team USA.

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:09.291
-Yeah. Hey.
-Hello?

01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:12.333
We need to pull him. Quickly if we can.

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:15.166
-What the hell's going on?
-I don't know.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.875
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.000
-Just like the white-winged dove
-We gotta go.

01:24:20.083 --> 01:24:22.000
Sings the song
Sounds like she's singing…

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:23.083
Move! Move!

01:24:24.916 --> 01:24:27.041
-What's happening?
-Calm down.

01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:29.625
Come on.

01:24:33.541 --> 01:24:34.875
What the fuck, Ken?

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:39.500
I'm connecting you to an NSCC.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:43.625
The United States is under attack, sir.

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:51.250
So it's a fucking coin toss?

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:54.291
That's what $50 billion buys us?

01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:56.666
We're talking about
hitting a bullet with a bullet.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.250
Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me?

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:02.458
Mr. President… …let's get you up to speed.

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:13.416
-So it could be a mistake.
-On our end or--

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.375
Lindsay!

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:17.125
We need to find
the nearest base to Chicago.

01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.750
-I don't think there is one.
-Anywhere that has a helicopter.

01:25:19.833 --> 01:25:21.916
-I can try National Guard.
-Find Carrie.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
-I'll try. I will call.
-They're saying it's 15 minutes. Hurry.

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:28.291
Reid, are you still there?

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.083
Yeah, uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:32.833
Oh.

01:25:32.916 --> 01:25:35.416
-Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
-What do you make of this?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.583
-I really don't know
-Don't know?

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:39.291
You're running the fucking Pentagon.

01:25:40.083 --> 01:25:42.625
They had one briefing
when I was sworn in. One.

01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:44.416
And they told me that's the protocol.

01:25:44.916 --> 01:25:46.583
They told me the same thing.

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.375
Shit, I got a whole fucking briefing
on when a Supreme Court justice dies.

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:54.125
Replacement. Replacement for what happens
if the replacement drops out.

01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:56.250
Shit, what to do if the original guy

01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:58.541
crawls out of his grave
and wants his job back.

01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:01.083
We focused on more likely scenarios.

01:26:01.166 --> 01:26:03.083
Things we might actually
have to deal with.

01:26:03.166 --> 01:26:04.333
Yeah, with this.

01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:06.875
Best I can remember, we follow the steps.

01:26:06.958 --> 01:26:09.000
We… we're following procedure.

01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:11.625
Negative. That's 20 minutes
from the South Lawn.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.541
-Go to Andrews.
-Anna. It's Jake.

01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:15.333
Jake. I just got a JEEP alert.

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:17.333
You're on an NSCC with the president.

01:26:17.416 --> 01:26:20.750
-I'm sorry, what?
-Hey, Miss Park. This is the president.

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:24.000
I understand that you're…
you're the expert.

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:25.666
There was a launch, A--

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.500
-Hi.
-Hey, leave a message.

01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:40.666
Please don't send me to voicemail.

01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:44.208
It's your father.
It's an emergency. Call me.

01:26:50.791 --> 01:26:52.083
Did you reach anyone?

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.416
I'm on with Great Lakes Naval Station.

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:58.125
-Maybe they can trace her phone.
-Transport's ready. Let's go, sir.

01:26:58.208 --> 01:27:00.458
-Go where?
-NMCC's initiated Ivy Pulse.

01:27:00.541 --> 01:27:02.750
-Helo's inbound.
-I didn't ask for that.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:05.708
-What about this call?
-Thank you. Hold on. What's happening?

01:27:05.791 --> 01:27:08.583
-I'm supposed to stay on.
-The secretary needs to evacuate.

01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:10.750
All right, can I speak to you
in the hallway, please?

01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:13.541
…enough of this. This is a waste of time.

01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:15.958
Sir, a cyber expert could potentially--

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:18.666
Yeah, well, find one, okay?

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:21.666
EKV has separated from the first GBI.

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:23.708
One minute to intercept.

01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:30.083
This better fucking work.

01:27:47.416 --> 01:27:49.041
How will we know, Tony?

01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:50.166
Give me a second.

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:52.458
We'll get the MDB on speaker
from Fort Greely.

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:01.500
Four minutes to the LZ, sir.

01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:03.708
Ten seconds.

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.500
Nine.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.833
-Eight. Seven.
-Listen, with the chips--

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.125
-We're good, man. I'm a slob.
-Six. Five…

01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:13.500
To hell with her.
Shouldn't have left it like that.

01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:15.083
Three.

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:16.500
Two.

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.708
One.

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:30.625
Confirm impact.

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:34.125
-Confirm impact.
-Stand by. Confirming.

01:28:37.541 --> 01:28:39.250
Come on. What are you waiting for?

01:28:42.458 --> 01:28:44.208
-It's negative.
-What'd he say?

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:46.333
What'd he say?

01:28:47.666 --> 01:28:48.666
I, uh…

01:28:49.375 --> 01:28:50.541
A negative impact.

01:28:51.583 --> 01:28:53.083
Object remains inbound.

01:29:01.791 --> 01:29:03.958
We did every fucking thing right.

01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:07.416
Mr. President, confirming DEFCON 1, sir.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.500
Oh Jesus. We just went DEFCON 1.

01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:12.708
-Okay.
-Negative impact.

01:29:12.791 --> 01:29:13.833
Confirming.

01:29:13.916 --> 01:29:15.041
Uh…

01:29:20.666 --> 01:29:23.791
Major, confirm the release
of two additional GBIs to intercept.

01:29:27.041 --> 01:29:28.708
Why the hell is that book out, son?

01:29:28.791 --> 01:29:32.166
Mr. President, significant time
and expertise were devoted

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.958
to designing these options.

01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:37.291
You'll find a range,
select, limited, and major,

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:40.208
depending on the scale of the response
you feel is warranted.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:43.625
I suggest you allow
Lieutenant Commander Reeves to brief you.

01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:47.583
Per the provisions
of OPLAN 8044, Revision 25,

01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:51.000
the NMCC requests authority
to initiate a counterstrike.

01:29:51.666 --> 01:29:53.791
The green tab are SAOs,

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:55.833
yellow, LAOs,

01:29:55.916 --> 01:29:57.416
and red, MAOs.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:00.500
Within each section,
your options are organized by region.

01:30:00.583 --> 01:30:04.041
On each page,
you'll find a designation number,

01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:06.666
both a map and a list of targets,

01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:09.500
along with enemy casualty estimates.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.750
Where would you like to begin, sir?

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.500
Mr. President, we're seeing
some concerning activity

01:30:15.583 --> 01:30:17.583
from our adversaries
on a number of fronts.

01:30:17.666 --> 01:30:20.291
More concerning
than a goddamn nuclear launch?

01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:21.541
-Please stop.
-Carrie.

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:23.750
-I told you, I need space.
-I know. I…

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:25.708
-Where are you?
-I'm not doing this now.

01:30:25.791 --> 01:30:27.541
Carrie, please.

01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:29.750
I'm home, about to leave for rehearsal.

01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:31.833
Look, can I call you later?

01:30:32.416 --> 01:30:34.958
My therapist actually thinks that…

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:40.375
I know we have to talk at some point.

01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:45.500
With Mom, it's just been a lot, okay?

01:30:46.125 --> 01:30:47.125
I know.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:50.625
You coming, hon?

01:30:51.291 --> 01:30:53.833
-Yeah, I'm coming. I have to go.
-We're gonna be late.

01:30:53.916 --> 01:30:56.541
-Who is that?
-A friend.

01:30:57.791 --> 01:30:59.416
I'm seeing someone.

01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:02.875
-You are?
-Yeah.

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.208
Is it serious?

01:31:05.291 --> 01:31:07.625
-Come on.
-Well, is it?

01:31:08.916 --> 01:31:10.416
Yeah, I think so.

01:31:12.208 --> 01:31:13.875
He's going with you to work?

01:31:14.458 --> 01:31:16.541
We walk together.
It's in the same direction.

01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:21.083
Good.

01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:23.333
That's good.

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:27.500
You're being really strange.
I'll call you when I can, okay?

01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:30.000
-I love you, Carrie.
-Goodbye, Dad.

01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:37.125
Okay.

01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:43.208
Sir, I insist that you leave.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.208
Sir, sorry. I've transferred the call.

01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:48.500
You need to leave now.

01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:50.166
Sir.

01:31:58.208 --> 01:32:01.166
We've already lost
one American city today.

01:32:02.708 --> 01:32:05.833
-How many more do you wanna risk?
-What kind of fucking question is that?

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:10.083
This is insanity, okay?

01:32:10.166 --> 01:32:11.083
No, sir.

01:32:13.125 --> 01:32:14.625
This is reality.

01:32:15.166 --> 01:32:17.041
Six minutes to impact.

01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:22.500
-What's your name?
-Lieutenant Commander Reeves, sir.

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:25.833
How old are you, man?

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:27.750
Uh, 32, sir.

01:32:28.333 --> 01:32:29.583
Got a family?

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:32.625
I have a wife, sir.

01:32:57.333 --> 01:32:58.708
Icon arriving.

01:33:20.708 --> 01:33:23.000
Andrews tower, Marine One taking off.

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:35.666
Eighty-nine targets,

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:39.125
mostly military installations
and leadership sites.

01:33:39.208 --> 01:33:42.541
As of last month,
we have a B-2 squadron forward-deployed.

01:33:42.625 --> 01:33:44.958
We'll also employ our Ohio-class subs,

01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:49.375
each with 24 Trident II D5
MIRV-equipped ballistic missiles.

01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:52.833
This option calls for
a dozen Minutemen as well, out of Warren.

01:33:52.916 --> 01:33:55.083
How does this make sure
we're not hit again?

01:33:55.958 --> 01:33:58.333
When I woke up this morning,
we were certain

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:01.500
the North Koreans
could not launch from a sub.

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:03.250
Now maybe they can. What the fuck?

01:34:03.333 --> 01:34:05.791
The plan assumes
our target list is incomplete.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:08.458
But by taking out the most critical
command and control centers,

01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:09.625
it lowers the chance…

01:34:09.708 --> 01:34:13.083
Or it provokes one, right?

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:15.333
Um…

01:34:16.333 --> 01:34:20.375
My job is to explain your options and
execute your orders. I'm not qualified--

01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:22.708
You carry this all day.
I've never seen it before.

01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:25.875
It's like a fucking diner menu.
I'm asking for your help, son.

01:34:29.541 --> 01:34:33.250
I actually call them
rare, medium, and well-done.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.541
-It's sick, I know.
-Illustrates the point.

01:34:40.166 --> 01:34:42.750
I sit still. Do nothing for now.

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:46.791
You can.
Hope this is a fluke or a one-off.

01:34:46.875 --> 01:34:49.000
That whoever did this just stops.

01:34:57.416 --> 01:34:58.916
God give you any answers?

01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:00.458
Uh…

01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:03.041
Not looking for one, sir. I just…

01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:05.500
Sorry, sir.

01:35:05.583 --> 01:35:07.958
Don't apologize. I go to church. I just…

01:35:09.833 --> 01:35:11.333
I haven't for a while.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.791
I always thought having you
follow me around with that book of plans

01:35:16.875 --> 01:35:18.416
for weapons like that…

01:35:18.916 --> 01:35:20.958
Just being ready is the point, right?

01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:24.041
Keeps people in check.
Keeps the world straight.

01:35:24.125 --> 01:35:28.750
If they see how prepared we are,
no one starts a nuclear war, right?

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:32.375
Like you said before, it's insanity.

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:35.125
But someone did.

01:35:36.458 --> 01:35:37.958
So none of this makes sense.

01:35:39.416 --> 01:35:40.875
Unless it was a mistake.

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:42.166
But the genie's out.

01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:46.041
If we do nothing, the bad guys see
that they can get away with it.

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.500
I listened to this podcast,

01:35:50.333 --> 01:35:52.125
and the guy said, uh,

01:35:52.208 --> 01:35:55.875
"It's like we all built
a house filled with dynamite."

01:35:57.166 --> 01:35:59.333
Making all these bombs
and all these plans, and

01:35:59.833 --> 01:36:01.833
the walls are just ready to blow.

01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:04.041
But we kept on living in it.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.166
If you're gonna hit back, sir…

01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:21.708
MAO7

01:36:22.833 --> 01:36:24.083
or MAO9.

01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:28.500
End it now, once and for all.

01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:32.250
It's the best chance
some of us survive this.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.166
Mr. President,
we're going to need your decision.

01:36:40.833 --> 01:36:43.833
Lieutenant Commander Reeves
is your strike advisor

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:47.750
and can walk you through
the authentication process.

01:36:47.833 --> 01:36:52.125
Then you'll need to read aloud
an attack option designation.

01:36:56.958 --> 01:36:59.375
Reid, I need you…

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:02.291
What do you think, Reid?

01:37:03.958 --> 01:37:05.333
Wait. Did we lose him?

01:37:05.916 --> 01:37:08.833
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
We're prepped and ready for takeoff.

01:37:08.916 --> 01:37:10.458
Sir, where are you going?

01:37:11.041 --> 01:37:12.625
No, no, no, no, no, sir!

01:37:13.166 --> 01:37:14.333
Holy shit!

01:37:14.916 --> 01:37:16.083
What was that?

01:37:17.375 --> 01:37:21.500
Mr. President?
It's Jake, uh, again, sir. Uh, Baerington.

01:37:21.583 --> 01:37:23.791
I just spoke
to the Russian foreign minister.

01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:27.041
He denies their responsibility
for the launch.

01:37:27.833 --> 01:37:31.375
Said he spoke to Beijing,
and he doesn't think it was them either.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.000
-I believed him, sir.
-You did?

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.541
They gonna back down?

01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:40.541
Sir, I think that they want to.

01:37:41.625 --> 01:37:44.166
And if we can guarantee
that we will not retaliate,

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.750
I think I can, uh…

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:49.583
we can convince them.

01:37:49.666 --> 01:37:52.291
-What… what does that mean?
-That we don't launch.

01:37:52.791 --> 01:37:54.041
Against anyone.

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:55.833
For now, at least.

01:37:55.916 --> 01:37:58.666
So we just sit back
and watch Chicago incinerate?

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:02.500
Are you kidding me? Do you think
the American people are gonna go for that?

01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:05.625
Sir, the… the warhead,
it might still malfunction.

01:38:05.708 --> 01:38:07.166
They do that sometimes.

01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:09.833
Did he agree to these terms?

01:38:10.333 --> 01:38:13.166
All right, we do nothing,
they back off for certain?

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:15.000
-More or less.
-More or less?!

01:38:15.708 --> 01:38:17.291
-Jake.
-Yes, sir.

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:19.125
I'm gonna need you to breathe.

01:38:19.208 --> 01:38:20.458
I'm breathing fine.

01:38:20.541 --> 01:38:23.916
Good 'cause my job is
to make this decision. I wish it weren't.

01:38:24.416 --> 01:38:27.833
And your job is to tell me
exactly what he agreed to.

01:38:28.458 --> 01:38:29.458
All right?

01:38:30.208 --> 01:38:33.000
-No bullshit. Can you do that?
-He didn't agree to anything.

01:38:33.083 --> 01:38:34.958
He said he needed
to speak with his president.

01:38:35.541 --> 01:38:37.833
Sounds to me like we know nothing new.

01:38:37.916 --> 01:38:39.166
Wrong, General.

01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:40.666
If we do what he's asking,

01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:42.916
if we hold back,
there's at least a chance.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.750
Two minutes and 30 seconds.

01:38:44.833 --> 01:38:50.166
Jake, I do what you're suggesting,
I let whoever did this get away with it.

01:38:50.916 --> 01:38:52.875
How is that any different
from surrendering?

01:38:52.958 --> 01:38:54.916
Sir, if you wanna look at it that way,

01:38:55.666 --> 01:38:57.833
then I'm telling you your choices are

01:38:57.916 --> 01:38:59.708
surrender or suicide.

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:11.125
I'm gonna need a minute.

01:39:29.125 --> 01:39:30.291
Yes, sir.

01:39:30.375 --> 01:39:31.666
-Ma'am.
-Yeah.

01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:33.458
It's the president. Sounds urgent.

01:39:37.083 --> 01:39:39.000
Hey, hon. Is everything okay?

01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:42.166
What?

01:39:49.166 --> 01:39:50.666
Did you say nuclear?

01:39:51.458 --> 01:39:52.958
Oh my God.

01:39:54.333 --> 01:39:56.083
Oh my God, I don't know.

01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:02.333
They want me to retaliate.

01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:08.291
It's a lot of lives. A lot of lives.
And if I don't…

01:40:11.541 --> 01:40:12.708
Are you there?

01:40:14.291 --> 01:40:15.458
Are you there?

01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:17.083
Ali.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.500
Can you get him back?

01:40:20.333 --> 01:40:21.916
-Alison.
-I…

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
You did what?

01:40:23.625 --> 01:40:25.041
This fucking…

01:40:37.125 --> 01:40:38.375
All right, I'm here.

01:40:39.083 --> 01:40:41.500
-You'll need your SAS card, sir.
-Oh.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.708
Right.

01:40:49.458 --> 01:40:51.291
Reminds me of when I was in college.

01:40:54.291 --> 01:40:56.666
You just, uh, read it aloud.

01:40:59.083 --> 01:41:01.833
November, Delta, Oscar.

01:41:02.416 --> 01:41:05.583
One, one, one, seven.

01:41:05.666 --> 01:41:08.541
-November, Delta, Oscar.
-Let me see that.

01:41:08.625 --> 01:41:10.958
One, one, one, seven.

01:41:12.875 --> 01:41:15.166
National command authority confirmed.

01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:18.666
Your orders, Mr. President?

01:41:19.416 --> 01:41:20.583
My orders?

01:41:30.041 --> 01:41:32.708
Joe! Joe, come on! Joe!

01:41:40.708 --> 01:41:42.708
-Form a line.
-Get your IDs out.

01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:44.250
Keep it orderly, folks.

01:41:44.333 --> 01:41:45.916
Keep moving, man.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.916
Have your IDs ready.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.916
Bus three is full! Send it!

01:41:50.833 --> 01:41:52.250
Room for two more on seven.

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:56.416
-Sorry, she's not on the list.
-This way. Come on.

01:41:56.916 --> 01:41:58.625
Keep it orderly, folks!

01:41:59.791 --> 01:42:02.750
-Bus four is ready. Send it.
-Get your IDs out.

01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:05.333
Have your IDs ready.
