00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.022
Honking for your dad? Huh?

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:21.886
Those honks were for your dad?

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:24.605
My dad’s inside. Why would I honk for him?

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.372
All you guys do is fight.

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:28.306
You’re grown now, you know?

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.000
When are you gonna stop, sons?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.417
I should just lock you two together
in a room until you learn.

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:35.413
Beam.

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:36.979
Is Beam really your type?

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.921
Or do you just like him
because Jinn liked him first?

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:43.670
If it’s not about Beam, then…

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.381
you’re jealous of me?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.124
So, what now?

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:51.025
You don’t have
your girlfriend’s place to crash anymore.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:52.620
If you don’t mind…

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.399
you can crash at my place.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.592
I don’t even know what ‘mind’ means.

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:59.017
So yeah, I’ll share your room, my friend.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.032
Tar just opened a new racing circuit.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:04.720
Wanted to see if you guys
want to give it a test run.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.607
If I hear you boys are racing again…

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.373
Who’d dare, ma’am?

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.087
Have you ever dreamed about
the same person over and over?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.095
Who is it you keep dreaming about?

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:27.404
Hey.

00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:34.545
What’s wrong with him?

00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:37.091
J!

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:37.824
Hey!

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:38.791
Shit!

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:50.169
J!

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:51.036
J.

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.128
J.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:54.420
J!

00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:56.297
Hey, jerk-face

00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:58.644
Can you hear me, J?

00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:00.379
J!

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:03.978
Asshole, unlock the car.

00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:09.288
J, you jerk!

00:02:10.623 --> 00:02:11.328
J!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.117
Open your eyes, asshole.

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:16.272
Hey, open your eyes!

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:24.442
Damn it.

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.582
I thought you were dead.

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:29.831
I don’t die that easily.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.870
You punk.

00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:33.409
I might’ve said after three laps
I’d send you straight to the crematorium,

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:36.797
but you didn’t have to take it that seriously.

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:38.731
I didn’t know you could be this obedient.

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:45.235
Ow.

00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:46.893
It hurts.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.317
What the hell are you looking at?

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.749
Ouch.

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:40.731
Ouch, Mom!

00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:42.275
Ouch, Mom!

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.012
You lied to me.

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.543
You said you were sick,
but it was just an excuse to go race!

00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:47.043
Ouch.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:50.266
It hurts. It really hurts.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:54.223
If that accident didn’t happen,
would you have just kept lying to us?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.706
J, you asshole.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.301
If you’re awake, help me out here!

00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:01.223
I saw that.

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:02.452
You’re awake, son?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.114
Where…

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:13.388
Where am I?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.469
In your coffin.

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.665
We’re about to light the cremation fire.

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:17.624
Cremation fire, huh?

00:05:19.697 --> 00:05:21.057
Does it hurt, sweetheart?

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.160
It hurts everywhere.

00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:25.560
Think I hit my left arm pretty bad.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.931
And your right?

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:29.594
My right arm doesn’t hurt as bad.

00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:30.563
Let me have a look.

00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:31.879
Right here?

00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:34.009
Ow, Mom!

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.782
You were acting like a child.

00:05:36.782 --> 00:05:39.028
You didn’t care about your life at all.

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:41.465
What are you laughing at?

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:42.111
Huh?

00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:44.728
Nothing, Gorgeous.

00:05:44.728 --> 00:05:45.698
What are you smiling at?

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:46.956
I’m not.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.512
Here he comes.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:55.580
How’s J doing?

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:57.677
Brain scan’s tomorrow.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.893
If it’s all clear,

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:00.492
he can go home and recover there.

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:01.918
Are visitors allowed yet?

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:04.180
Beam’s been dying to see him.

00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:07.177
It took Mai forever
to talk him into going home.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.080
True.

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:09.870
Somehow, that turned into my job.

00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:10.916
We’d better not go.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:12.887
Let him stay with his family.

00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:13.861
If you guys show up,

00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:16.530
his mom and mine will chew you out.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.309
One of my ears
already went deaf from all the yelling.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:22.703
Tar.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.312
I’m sorry for the trouble we caused.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.266
It’s fine.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.022
I’m just glad you guys are okay.

00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:31.123
I told my crew to check the track again.

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:32.535
Everything’s normal.

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:35.091
What made J lose control that bad, anyway?

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:47.655
Come.

00:06:56.203 --> 00:06:59.059
Good thing your brain’s fine.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.863
As for your hand, it’ll be about a month
before you can use it again.

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:09.171
So, what about my baby?

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:11.514
It’ll be in the garage for a while.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.638
Looks like it’ll take about
as long to heal as your hand.

00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:18.047
Both limping, father and baby.

00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.712
How am I supposed to get to uni?

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.129
Maybe…

00:07:22.902 --> 00:07:25.108
Jinn’s car.

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:27.381
What about Jinn’s car?

00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:30.364
Those are my suitcases.
Where are you taking them?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.125
Honey, you haven’t told our son
what the “big racer prize” is yet?

00:07:41.207 --> 00:07:42.477
What’s the answer, Dad?

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.107
Wait, I don’t think I got it.

00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:49.434
Can you please repeat it for me, Mom?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.314
Ahem.

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:54.840
Listen again carefully.

00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:03.189
Until J’s hand is
completely, absolutely, 100% healed.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.551
You’re kidding!

00:08:11.806 --> 00:08:13.664
You boys are going to live together.

00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:14.578
Eat together.

00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:16.083
Sleep together.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.000
Go to school together.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.985
And most importantly, you will help
each other with everything in daily life.

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:30.620
And J, don’t you dare mess with Jinn
or make things harder for him.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.268
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:31.963
Quiet!

00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:33.568
We’re not done yet. Don’t talk!

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.304
If there’s any prank or fight,
no matter who starts it,

00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:45.747
the punishment adds
another month each time!

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:49.945
- Deal.
- Deal.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:13.259
This is a sight I never thought
I’d see in my lifetime.

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:17.480
I’d rather let a dog poop in my room
than have you sitting here.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.679
As if I want to be here with you.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.883
Then why didn’t you help me
say no to those two ladies?

00:09:22.117 --> 00:09:24.310
You were just nodding along.

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:25.520
Stupid dumbass!

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.841
Will you shut your mouth?

00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:29.800
You know how close our moms are.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.816
Just be patient and
go with the flow for a month or two.

00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:34.713
Better that than arguing
and getting our punishment extended.

00:09:40.849 --> 00:09:42.378
I know you don’t have much,

00:09:42.846 --> 00:09:44.748
but try using what’s left of your brain, yeah?

00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:45.504
Before it completely atrophies.

00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:50.917
You bastard.

00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:52.292
Help me open my bag.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:58.780
Fine.

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:05.300
I’m about to explode here.

00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.433
Seeing him at uni already drives me insane,

00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.372
and now I have to sleep
in the same bed with him.

00:10:10.747 --> 00:10:13.510
I can’t imagine how
I’m supposed to survive each hour.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.302
Your moms are cruel.

00:10:15.513 --> 00:10:19.752
They know exactly
how much you two love each other.

00:10:22.094 --> 00:10:22.867
Feed me.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.525
You’ve got hands. Feed yourself.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:26.707
My hands aren’t free.

00:10:27.597 --> 00:10:29.811
Hey, can I share your room too?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.587
Nope.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.742
I already take up
all the space in Farm’s room.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.036
It’s good.

00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:36.752
Give me more.

00:10:40.054 --> 00:10:40.987
Just deal with it.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.088
You two need to tone it down.

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:45.720
Take a break from fighting.
Just live peacefully for once.

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:48.491
Once J’s better,
you can go your separate ways.

00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:49.248
Are you nuts?

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:51.819
You think people who’ve been
messing with each other for ten years

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.342
can act all nice and kissy
with a snap of a finger?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.297
I honestly have no idea
what our moms were thinking.

00:10:56.297 --> 00:10:57.464
Calm down, man.

00:10:57.464 --> 00:11:00.386
And the doctor said it’ll take
a month for him to recover.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.249
I’ll lose my damn mind before that.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.025
Come on, look on the bright side.

00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:07.691
You guys get to live together,
spend time together...

00:11:07.808 --> 00:11:10.463
Who knows? Sparks might fly.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:12.687
Sparks, my ass!

00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:14.969
Two tigers…

00:11:16.163 --> 00:11:18.454
can never share the same den.

00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:24.559
Whatever you say, Tiger.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.239
What a puppy.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.714
What are you looking at?

00:11:32.798 --> 00:11:33.484
Ouch.

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:34.463
Hey.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.478
It tickles.

00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:36.187
It does?

00:11:36.187 --> 00:11:37.468
- It does, huh?
- Hey!

00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:38.658
Van!

00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:39.438
Stop it.

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:43.656
- You started it.
- Stop it.

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:45.044
Ow.

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:46.241
Hey!

00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:15.642
What the hell are you looking at?

00:12:21.966 --> 00:12:22.642
J.

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:27.328
Asshole!

00:12:29.506 --> 00:12:30.770
Why are you so loud?

00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:35.340
What shit are you playing?

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:42.558
Two tigers can’t share one den.

00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:43.431
What tigers?

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:45.271
I’m marking our territories. See this line?

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:47.936
You can’t cross it.

00:12:50.746 --> 00:12:53.323
Is your brain underdeveloped?

00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:57.323
I told you many times that…

00:12:57.323 --> 00:12:58.100
Hey, what are you doing?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.986
What the heck, J?

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:00.930
Damn it.

00:13:01.117 --> 00:13:01.842
Stop it.

00:13:01.983 --> 00:13:02.727
I won’t.

00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:03.291
You—

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:03.791
Or what?

00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:04.821
You gonna hit me?

00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:07.261
You can’t hurt an injured man.

00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:08.297
Dumbass.

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:10.504
What a jerk-face.

00:13:13.174 --> 00:13:14.951
You look more like a newborn kitten,

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.058
yet you’re calling yourself a tiger.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.583
Here, I’m giving this back.

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:24.113
If you hit me,

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:27.605
it’ll just take me longer to recover.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.274
So if you want me to go home early,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.426
don’t do anything stupid.

00:13:33.637 --> 00:13:34.328
Got it?

00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:35.810
Bleh!

00:13:57.506 --> 00:13:58.366
Ugh!

00:13:59.724 --> 00:14:02.202
Do you mind sparing some
oxygen for the rest of the world?

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:03.784
You keep sighing.

00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:05.323
So annoying.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.350
It’s my room.

00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:08.080
I can do whatever I want.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.436
But you’re not alone in it.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.379
Look. I know you hate my guts.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:14.044
Right.

00:14:14.044 --> 00:14:15.849
But while we’re stuck living together,

00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:18.123
can you at least pretend to forget that?

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.452
You say that like it’s easy.

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:22.983
Don’t forget—we’ve got
at least a month of this.

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:25.172
If you keep getting on my nerves like this,

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.821
once my hand heals,

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:31.016
we’ll both need therapy after.

00:14:34.892 --> 00:14:35.798
Then what do you suggest, genius?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.296
Got any bright ideas?

00:14:39.537 --> 00:14:42.660
We’re supposed to live together
until my hand’s fully healed, right?

00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:48.154
So if you take good care of me...

00:14:51.082 --> 00:14:53.052
it’ll heal fast.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.764
And if I heal faster, I’ll leave sooner.

00:15:25.712 --> 00:15:26.420
Geez!

00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:29.684
Be still, you jerk.

00:15:30.223 --> 00:15:32.027
Just stick your head in it.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.005
Hold it higher.

00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:37.520
As high as I can reach.

00:15:38.457 --> 00:15:39.329
It’s too high.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.633
Yeah, like that.

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:43.938
Not that hard, is it?

00:15:54.601 --> 00:15:56.109
Hope you choke to death.

00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:01.676
That’s it.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.196
Can you do that?

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:08.604
So, are you proposing a truce?

00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:10.458
Yeah?

00:16:15.587 --> 00:16:16.740
Turn off the light.

00:16:17.255 --> 00:16:17.909
Prick.

00:16:23.717 --> 00:16:24.819
What am I even doing?

00:16:44.411 --> 00:16:45.176
Hey!

00:16:45.996 --> 00:16:46.707
You wanna fight?

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:47.970
No. Just sleep.

00:16:56.735 --> 00:17:00.940
Gosh, you stupid bastard.

00:17:03.118 --> 00:17:04.592
I can’t hit you,

00:17:04.592 --> 00:17:06.258
or you might have to stay longer.

00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:07.957
Bad night, punk.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.800
Careful!

00:17:14.362 --> 00:17:15.023
What are you doing?

00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:17.786
J, did you get a proper brain scan?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.668
Who knows?

00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:21.943
The accident might turn hate into love.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.343
Two spoons of coffee.

00:18:00.929 --> 00:18:02.163
One and a half sugar.

00:18:06.445 --> 00:18:08.281
Holy shit—what is this?

00:18:10.571 --> 00:18:11.265
Careful!

00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:13.282
What are you doing?

00:18:16.292 --> 00:18:18.764
I want this cup. Make yourself a new one.

00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:19.899
What a jerk.

00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:30.349
Careful with hot water.

00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:02.735
Thanks, dear.

00:19:16.084 --> 00:19:20.710
I used to think you’d be the last person
on earth to ever sit in my car.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:26.498
Funny, I used to think this would be
the last car on earth I’d ever sit in.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:31.382
We might get used to it soon.

00:19:31.382 --> 00:19:33.347
Right. I think so too.

00:19:34.394 --> 00:19:35.049
But damn.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.144
- This is so f*cked up.
- This is so f*cked up.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:43.862
You better recover fast.

00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:48.148
If this keeps up, we’ll die of shock.

00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:50.780
Yeah, no argument there.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.335
I buckled up first.

00:20:03.021 --> 00:20:03.981
So what?

00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:29.706
Guys, guys, stop.

00:20:31.508 --> 00:20:32.453
Shit.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.201
Tell me I’m seeing this right.

00:20:36.199 --> 00:20:39.206
The 2Js from fashion
just got out of the same car?

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:40.241
Perfect chemistry.

00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:41.699
- Right.
- Totally.

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.919
Chemistry…

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.492
my ass!

00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:53.949
I’d rather become a monk
than end up with you.

00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:55.421
My monk’s chamber
will be right next to yours.

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:24.057
Mai.

00:21:24.155 --> 00:21:24.748
Yeah?

00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:27.819
Since the semester started, have you
even gone to any of your own classes?

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.970
I just wanted to witness
world history with my own eyes.

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.356
This should go in the world record—

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:36.575
the 2Js from fashion actually calling a truce.

00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:39.942
Mai, don’t freaking bug me.

00:21:39.942 --> 00:21:40.442
Oopsie.

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:44.009
J, did you get a proper brain scan?

00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:44.656
Why?

00:21:45.114 --> 00:21:45.741
Who knows?

00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:49.134
The accident might turn hate into love.

00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:52.270
Love, my foot!

00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:53.181
Idiot.

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.777
Oh, gosh.

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.536
Guys, wanna hit the racetrack?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.077
Yes, I’m in.

00:22:12.077 --> 00:22:12.778
We’ve got one.

00:22:13.522 --> 00:22:14.239
Farm, come with us.

00:22:15.908 --> 00:22:17.391
Please.

00:22:17.391 --> 00:22:18.352
Mai, look.

00:22:18.352 --> 00:22:19.908
I am looking. I am.

00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:21.697
Okay, fine.

00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:22.553
Yay!

00:22:22.831 --> 00:22:23.918
Apart from J and Jinn,

00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:28.013
you two are also weirdly inseparable.

00:22:29.387 --> 00:22:31.222
Of course. I’m sharing his room.

00:22:31.222 --> 00:22:32.745
He also gave me a ride here today.

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.111
If he doesn’t come with us,
I’ll have to find my own way back.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.163
And Tar’s racetrack is super duper far.

00:22:39.457 --> 00:22:42.639
Right, super duper far.

00:22:42.639 --> 00:22:43.874
That’s why you must stick together?

00:22:43.939 --> 00:22:45.603
Save your suspicion about me and Farm.

00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:49.598
If we ever catch feelings,
the world would explode, just like the 2Js.

00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:50.098
Fine.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.767
Anyway, you two, what’s going on?

00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:54.830
Wrong direction.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.466
Thought you wouldn’t catch that.

00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:57.139
Thanks.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.636
So what’s going on between you two?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.809
J’s still limp.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.834
And that freaking concerns you how?

00:23:01.834 --> 00:23:02.870
I have to take care of him.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.350
- Ah, you have to take care of him.
- Yeah, I do.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.779
Tell Tar I said hi.

00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:07.684
Come on, shorty.

00:23:07.684 --> 00:23:08.599
Shorty, he said.

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:09.521
I’m going back to nap.

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:10.482
Who did you just call short?

00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:11.397
Who’s short? Huh?

00:23:11.908 --> 00:23:14.093
Keep mouthing off,
and your other hand’s next.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.110
I really wanna see
what they’re like living together.

00:23:17.192 --> 00:23:18.511
Should be hella fun.

00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:19.011
Right.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.682
Are you almost done?

00:23:30.335 --> 00:23:31.017
Yeah, almost.

00:23:32.342 --> 00:23:33.761
When will I get my turn to use it?

00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:39.938
Huh?

00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:41.836
My sewing machine.

00:23:42.196 --> 00:23:43.409
My desk.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.289
Fine.

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:53.522
Please.

00:23:53.718 --> 00:23:54.807
I’m just borrowing it for a bit.

00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:56.924
I have to turn in my assignment.

00:23:57.268 --> 00:23:58.394
Are you the only one with an assignment?

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.082
I have to submit mine too.

00:24:01.015 --> 00:24:02.086
After one hour, we’ll take turns.

00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:03.265
Okay?

00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:05.054
Fine.

00:24:05.283 --> 00:24:08.063
I’m not used to you being this obedient.

00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:10.330
That smart mouth is asking for my foot.

00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:26.633
What? It hasn’t even been five minutes yet.

00:24:27.124 --> 00:24:27.765
I’m helping.

00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:33.537
Yeah, suit yourself.

00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:52.025
You don’t have to look at me with heart eyes.

00:24:53.268 --> 00:24:56.268
I know I’m totally cool right now.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.676
I know I’m totally cool right now.

00:25:00.035 --> 00:25:01.388
Now you’re just letting me work for you.

00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:03.825
Don’t look at me with those eyes.

00:25:05.134 --> 00:25:05.660
J!

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:07.329
J.

00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:16.831
I... I don’t think I can do this.

00:25:17.862 --> 00:25:19.489
I’ll tell the professor tomorrow

00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:21.197
that my arm hurts.

00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:23.000
He’ll understand.

00:25:24.748 --> 00:25:25.348
Is something wrong?

00:25:25.348 --> 00:25:25.933
No.

00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:28.617
I’m going to bed.

00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:37.674
Don’t forget your meds.

00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:44.564
What’s up with him?

00:25:48.245 --> 00:25:49.315
He’s my hubby.

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:51.528
Don’t joke like that—some ghostly force
might actually push you two together.

00:25:52.364 --> 00:25:53.707
Don’t get too close to me,

00:25:53.936 --> 00:25:55.518
or you’ll fall in love.

00:26:20.706 --> 00:26:22.136
Shit.

00:26:22.483 --> 00:26:23.969
Tar is really cool.

00:26:24.287 --> 00:26:25.818
I wanna race on the circuit too.

00:26:25.936 --> 00:26:26.623
Forget it.

00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:31.252
With your driving skills? You can’t even
stop close enough to reach the toll booth.

00:26:32.016 --> 00:26:33.359
That stings.

00:26:34.501 --> 00:26:36.609
So after you hit the road barrier,

00:26:36.609 --> 00:26:38.815
your driving still hasn’t improved?

00:26:38.974 --> 00:26:40.181
Hey, I do have a driver’s license.

00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:40.839
You bought it.

00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:43.440
I earned it with my driving skills!

00:26:43.613 --> 00:26:45.285
I just don’t drive much, so I’m a bit rusty.

00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:46.841
That’s because your
partner always drives for you.

00:26:46.942 --> 00:26:50.021
Why don’t you use all that energy
roasting me to find yourself a partner?

00:26:50.252 --> 00:26:52.836
Aren’t you tired of being single forever?

00:26:53.675 --> 00:26:55.572
Right, you’re right!

00:26:55.847 --> 00:26:57.196
Who’d be as lucky as you?

00:26:57.496 --> 00:27:00.735
Even when you’re single,
you’ve got your buddy driving you around.

00:27:00.937 --> 00:27:01.803
Who said he’s my buddy?

00:27:02.352 --> 00:27:03.275
He’s my hubby.

00:27:03.275 --> 00:27:05.518
Don’t joke like that—some ghostly force
might actually push you two together.

00:27:06.197 --> 00:27:07.661
You scared of ghosts, babe?

00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:08.850
I don’t like it when you mess around like this.

00:27:09.053 --> 00:27:10.295
Aw, are you blushing, babe?

00:27:11.123 --> 00:27:13.117
I said stop it, Van. I don’t like it.

00:27:13.522 --> 00:27:15.594
What? Do you have to be so serious?

00:27:15.594 --> 00:27:17.034
You should learn to be serious for once.

00:27:25.406 --> 00:27:26.917
There’s really nothing wrong with the track.

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:29.791
The spot where J lost control
isn’t dangerous or anything.

00:27:29.964 --> 00:27:30.661
Wow.

00:27:30.993 --> 00:27:32.766
You even tested it yourself, Tar?

00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:34.051
It’s my circuit,

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:36.619
my juniors’ safety, and my customers.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.150
If I don’t drive on it myself, then who will?

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.103
Well said.

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:42.624
Speaking of, Tar…

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:43.456
Hm?

00:27:43.904 --> 00:27:45.527
Can I do just one lap?

00:27:45.889 --> 00:27:46.389
Sure.

00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:47.016
For real?!

00:27:47.016 --> 00:27:49.536
There’s a housekeeper’s bicycle
parked nearby. You can ride that.

00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:52.764
What the—?

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:57.116
I visit your track all the time,
yet I’ve never gotten to drive!

00:27:57.289 --> 00:28:00.552
Even J, someone I trust,
ended up in the hospital.

00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:03.069
If it’s you, we’d be
carrying you to the crematorium.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.894
Come on, I can’t be that bad.

00:28:06.183 --> 00:28:07.252
No means no.

00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:08.985
But if Farm’s driving, that’s another story.

00:28:11.153 --> 00:28:12.546
You’re my passenger today.

00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:13.452
That good enough?

00:28:13.452 --> 00:28:14.131
Yeah. That’s perfect.

00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:16.602
Thank you.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:17.938
Drive safe.

00:28:32.748 --> 00:28:33.423
Yes, Mom.

00:28:33.654 --> 00:28:35.352
Of course, I’m very happy.

00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:37.267
My friends love me.

00:28:39.768 --> 00:28:40.300
Mom,

00:28:41.326 --> 00:28:42.152
can I ask you a favor?

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:43.900
Buy me a Lambo.

00:28:49.729 --> 00:28:50.656
Tar, where’s my Lambo?

00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:03.715
I know I’m totally cool right now.

00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:06.755
Am I just being delusional?

00:29:58.168 --> 00:29:59.645
Why is it always you…

00:30:03.129 --> 00:30:04.525
in every single one of my dreams?

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.559
Can you hit the gas
and make that loud, cool sound?

00:30:24.684 --> 00:30:28.533
That’s it! So awesome!

00:30:29.386 --> 00:30:30.369
Don’t film me.

00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:34.195
How can a guy this
handsome and cool still be single?

00:30:34.195 --> 00:30:35.092
Look.

00:30:36.422 --> 00:30:38.580
Put on your seatbelt. We’re about to go.

00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:40.081
My hands aren’t free.

00:30:40.442 --> 00:30:41.002
Do it for me.

00:30:58.271 --> 00:30:59.586
Don’t get too close to me,

00:31:01.147 --> 00:31:02.488
or you’ll fall in love.

00:31:04.252 --> 00:31:06.802
If I fall, I can climb back up.

00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:08.667
No worries.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.691
Sit tight. We’re taking off.

00:31:52.016 --> 00:31:55.818
This is the best ice cream flavor in the world.

00:31:56.873 --> 00:32:01.539
Even when I’m sixty or seventy, you still
have to buy me strawberry ice cream.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.854
Mm.

00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:07.660
Here.

00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:35.011
You don’t happen to
like strawberry ice cream, do you?

00:32:35.242 --> 00:32:39.261
Only three-year-old girls eat pink ice cream.

00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:41.548
Lots of people like strawberry.

00:33:18.594 --> 00:33:19.533
No way…

00:33:23.921 --> 00:33:25.962
Just freakin’ eat so we can get to uni.

00:33:29.619 --> 00:33:31.714
You didn’t put poison in this, did you?

00:33:32.792 --> 00:33:33.423
No.

00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:36.377
I just stirred it with my toes.

00:33:43.152 --> 00:33:45.204
You’re an absolute prick.

00:33:48.707 --> 00:33:50.496
Can you take me home
to get my sewing machine?

00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:52.298
Then I’ll go buy a new desk.

00:33:52.452 --> 00:33:53.094
What?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.094
You’re only here for a month.
What’s a new desk for?

00:33:56.094 --> 00:33:57.602
You can use this table.

00:33:58.025 --> 00:33:59.484
A desk isn’t disposable furniture.

00:33:59.484 --> 00:34:00.164
I’m rich.

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:04.710
I can throw it away after
or toss it at your face.

00:34:08.718 --> 00:34:09.270
Hold on a sec.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.690
You can only use one hand.

00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:14.455
How did you open the food bag?

00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:18.736
I bit it open and poured it into the bowl.

00:34:19.487 --> 00:34:21.534
So, you’re eating
rice porridge with my saliva.

00:34:21.958 --> 00:34:24.017
After this, you’re my little slave.

00:34:24.017 --> 00:34:24.982
J, you asshole.

00:34:25.617 --> 00:34:27.158
You’re serious. I can tell.

00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:31.927
Damn you.

00:34:32.044 --> 00:34:33.360
Ew!!

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:38.628
Go on, eat.

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:40.694
Yuck, yuck!

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:42.288
You can have it.

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:54.433
I missed you so much, Gorgeous.

00:34:54.433 --> 00:34:55.076
Argh!

00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:56.134
Oops.

00:34:57.539 --> 00:34:59.483
Come on.

00:35:00.407 --> 00:35:04.913
Quite the impressive welcome home.

00:35:05.914 --> 00:35:08.163
Why’d you sneak up on me like that, son?

00:35:08.567 --> 00:35:09.662
Look, you’re all soaked.

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:11.055
Where’s Jinn, by the way?

00:35:11.055 --> 00:35:11.924
Didn’t you two come together?

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.783
He’s at his house, of course.

00:35:13.783 --> 00:35:15.096
Why would he be at ours?

00:35:15.904 --> 00:35:16.404
Dad.

00:35:16.404 --> 00:35:17.045
Hm?

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.585
How’s my baby boy?

00:35:18.739 --> 00:35:19.836
Is he fixed?

00:35:19.836 --> 00:35:21.265
The garage called.

00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:23.537
They said if the parts come in on time,
it should be ready by next month.

00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:24.371
Really?

00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:27.587
Even if it’s fixed, you’re not driving it.

00:35:28.703 --> 00:35:29.787
Mom!

00:35:29.864 --> 00:35:31.639
Don’t make that face at me.

00:35:31.735 --> 00:35:35.176
After what you did, you’re lucky I didn’t sell it.

00:35:35.696 --> 00:35:37.954
Mom, please don’t sell my boy,

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.684
or I’ll die from heartbreak.

00:35:39.926 --> 00:35:41.436
You can confiscate it. I’m fine with that.

00:35:41.879 --> 00:35:44.181
Just don’t sell my baby.

00:35:44.951 --> 00:35:48.572
When your hand is fully healed,

00:35:48.644 --> 00:35:50.416
we’ll have this talk again.

00:35:52.014 --> 00:35:53.801
Hi, Auntie Jen, Uncle Wee.

00:35:54.917 --> 00:35:55.624
Should we hit the road, bastard?!

00:36:00.185 --> 00:36:00.769
Oops.

00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:05.132
Let’s go back to my place, my friend.

00:36:07.153 --> 00:36:08.841
Let’s go, dear friend.

00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:10.784
Okay, dear friend.

00:36:11.207 --> 00:36:13.269
Hold on, dear friend.

00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:16.552
Yes, dear friend?

00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:19.320
This dear friend has a favor to ask.

00:36:19.724 --> 00:36:21.059
Hm?

00:36:21.444 --> 00:36:23.294
Can you carry the machine for me?

00:36:25.446 --> 00:36:27.251
Of course, friend.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.564
You jerk.

00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:32.401
Give you an inch,
and you take a mile, damn it.

00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:35.703
Goodbye.

00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:37.232
Bye-bye.

00:36:37.617 --> 00:36:38.696
Come on, dear friend.

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.179
Sure, dear friend.

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:10.347
Gosh.

00:37:13.908 --> 00:37:15.108
Thanks,

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:17.851
Nong J-J-Jinn.

00:37:19.391 --> 00:37:20.208
Save it for your dad!

00:37:21.016 --> 00:37:22.943
Just recover fast.
I don’t wanna live with you anymore.

00:37:23.655 --> 00:37:25.127
Like I want to live with you.

00:37:29.883 --> 00:37:32.085
You smell of kitten food. It stinks.

00:37:32.393 --> 00:37:33.527
Your face stinks.

00:37:34.906 --> 00:37:36.353
Stop calling me a kitten.

00:37:40.184 --> 00:37:42.200
Meow. Meow.

00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:43.948
You dumb jerk. I’ll scratch your face.

00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:45.706
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

00:37:45.706 --> 00:37:46.377
Meow!

00:37:46.377 --> 00:37:47.587
Meow.

00:37:48.364 --> 00:37:50.008
Meow to your dad.

00:38:11.897 --> 00:38:15.546
How the hell did I know
where this screwdriver was kept?

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.353
I ordered ice cream.

00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:52.325
Have some.

00:38:53.942 --> 00:38:54.548
No.

00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:55.310
I already brushed my teeth.

00:38:57.023 --> 00:38:58.173
What a waste of my generosity.

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.009
What generosity?

00:39:03.319 --> 00:39:08.296
I bought it as payment
for you carrying my desk up here.

00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:14.016
If you’re not gonna eat it,
just let it freaking melt.

00:39:17.384 --> 00:39:19.357
Then why didn’t you
put it in the fridge, jackass?

00:39:20.262 --> 00:39:22.663
Gosh, you just don’t use your brain.

00:39:49.394 --> 00:39:54.403
Even when I’m sixty or seventy, you still
have to buy me strawberry ice cream.

00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:03.483
I hope it doesn’t have your saliva.

00:40:07.044 --> 00:40:08.591
At least this one doesn’t match.

00:40:12.815 --> 00:40:13.577
What are you looking at?

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.941
If you want it, go grab it.

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:19.925
So…

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.901
You don’t happen to
like strawberry ice cream, do you?

00:40:25.036 --> 00:40:25.714
Like hell I do.

00:40:26.214 --> 00:40:30.233
Only three-year-old girls eat pink ice cream.

00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:31.312
Don’t be a bully.

00:40:32.274 --> 00:40:34.744
Lots of people like strawberry.

00:40:35.244 --> 00:40:38.675
Say that elsewhere,
and you might get beaten up.

00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:45.272
Jinn, help me here.

00:40:45.272 --> 00:40:45.772
What?

00:40:46.022 --> 00:40:47.029
I told you I wouldn’t help.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:52.709
Hey, hey.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.730
Say it nicely.

00:41:01.213 --> 00:41:03.115
Can you say it nicely?

00:41:03.808 --> 00:41:04.562
Nicely?

00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:16.091
Here, try this,

00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:19.663
“Phi Jinn, can you please help Nong J?”

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.931
Try this…

00:41:24.992 --> 00:41:27.930
“Please, Phi Jinn.”

00:41:45.122 --> 00:41:46.324
Can you please help Nong?

00:41:47.864 --> 00:41:49.166
Nong really can’t do it.

00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:50.674
Can you please help Nong?

00:41:51.867 --> 00:41:53.274
Nong really can’t do it.

00:42:35.004 --> 00:42:38.687
Every single thing I see in my dreams
always comes true.

00:42:41.728 --> 00:42:42.672
This is good.

00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:45.551
Do you really like strawberry ice cream?

00:42:48.804 --> 00:42:49.529
Geez!

00:42:50.915 --> 00:42:51.941
Is it happening again?

00:42:53.462 --> 00:42:54.532
What did he tell you?

00:42:54.532 --> 00:42:55.345
Nothing.

00:42:55.672 --> 00:42:57.296
He just said he didn’t sleep well.

00:42:57.296 --> 00:42:58.659
I feel like he’s being weird.

00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:00.184
J!

00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:01.581
You just spaced out.

00:43:01.773 --> 00:43:03.167
It’s like he’s always thinking about something.

00:43:03.244 --> 00:43:05.468
He might always be like that.

00:43:05.468 --> 00:43:07.430
You just didn’t care to notice before.

00:43:09.524 --> 00:43:10.642
What are you thinking,

00:43:10.911 --> 00:43:12.603
making your secret crush your roommate?

00:43:13.004 --> 00:43:16.684
Friends can develop into lovers.

00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:22.303
Damn it, J!

00:43:28.404 --> 00:43:29.171
So?

00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:29.964
What did the doc say?

00:43:30.503 --> 00:43:31.484
You care about me?
