00:13.304 --> 00:16.433
See, I told you there was weird shit
going on over at the airbase!

00:17.017 --> 00:19.853
They made a giant fucking mutant baby!

00:23.440 --> 00:24.566
Come on, Susie!

00:31.281 --> 00:32.907
Guys, come on!

00:46.129 --> 00:47.338
Go! Go!

00:50.967 --> 00:52.302
Susie!

00:52.886 --> 00:55.096
-Lilly!
-Give me your hand.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.697
So, Grogan, huh?

03:19.073 --> 03:20.366
Chief's pretty sure.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.078
The projectionist in the movie theater...

03:25.997 --> 03:27.248
with the candlestick.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.879
Little Philly Malkin
went to school with my boy.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.173
Show some respect.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.133
Sorry.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.558
And what do you think he did to 'em?
A lot of blood, no bodies?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.103
How the hell should I know?

03:51.689 --> 03:52.815
Maybe he ate 'em.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.203
Those poor parents, though.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.958
It's a goddamn tragedy is what it is.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.627
Sick bastard.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.387
They're still out there.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.555
Well, they gon' stay out there

04:24.639 --> 04:27.517
till they either find those kids
or figure out how to pin this on me.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.269
I told 'em you were nowhere near

04:29.352 --> 04:31.938
that theater
when all that ugliness happened.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.817
Told 'em you were here, in bed,
after watching The Andy Griffith with me.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.194
Told 'em they could ask you all about it.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.446
And you think they gon' take
my momma's word for an alibi?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.658
They're trying to intimidate us is what.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.494
Make you confess
to something you didn't do.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.454
Well, fuck 'em!

04:48.538 --> 04:50.665
Calm down, Momma.
You know Ronnie's still sleeping.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.543
And she shouldn't have let
those kids in in the first damn place.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.379
They were just trying to figure out
what happened to that Clements boy.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.797
That's all.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.757
-None of this is her fault.
-It's your fault.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.803
Filling her head full
of Hollywood nonsense,

05:03.886 --> 05:05.847
thinking she Nora Charles or some such

05:05.930 --> 05:08.766
till she forget how the world really is.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.643
She's safe, Momma.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.312
That's all that matters.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.815
You're going to send that girl
back to school next week.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.650
She need that education

05:17.734 --> 05:20.028
if she ever going to get
the hell out of this town.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.114
Momma, kids missing, people watching us,

05:23.197 --> 05:26.409
whispering behind my back,
your back, our backs.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.037
If you think I'm lettin' Ronnie
out of my sight,

05:29.120 --> 05:32.749
-you got another thing coming.
-You can't protect that girl forever.

05:33.832 --> 05:37.337
Now come Monday,
she gon' march into that school

05:37.420 --> 05:39.213
with her head held high.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.051
Ronnie, don't play with me now.
I know you're there.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.929
Veronica Grogan.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.736
Are they really gonna try
and pin this on you

06:01.819 --> 06:03.696
-and take you away?
-No. No, baby. No.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.115
-I heard, you said--
-I know... I know what I said.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.368
-That's just grown folks talking.
-Come on.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.830
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.333
Everything will be okay.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.210
You hear me?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.966
-There he is.
-Dad!

07:08.678 --> 07:09.971
Let me see the grip.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
-Yeah, that's the best you got?
-That you can handle.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.561
It's like that. Okay.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.687
There you go.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.690
How you doing?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.734
-I wanna see my room.
-Upstairs.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.905
You know I've been waiting
on this porch for you for two hours.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.615
Two hours, yeah.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.659
Well, we kept it
well below the speed limit.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.162
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.792
What's wrong?

07:39.876 --> 07:43.754
I had a little mishap on base
and it banged me up a little bit.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.507
-Oh, no. Bad?
-I'll live.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.802
What you think?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.598
-It's more space.
-It's very nice.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.391
Hey, yeah, quiet neighborhood. Yeah?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.977
-All right. Yeah.
-It's beautiful.

08:04.775 --> 08:05.902
Good afternoon.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.491
You sure we're... we're good here?

08:13.367 --> 08:16.746
If anybody's got a problem with it,
they can take it up with JFK.

08:25.421 --> 08:29.217
Oh my... This thing is amazing.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.929
Would you look at that!

08:33.011 --> 08:36.057
Yeah, I found a nice little
secondhand shop downtown.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.476
-Owner cut me a deal.
-It's the exact kind I wanted.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.186
How did you know?

08:40.269 --> 08:42.480
You think your old man
doesn't know his own kid?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.608
Well, last present you got me was a tie.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.360
Will, you said you loved that tie.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.987
Yeah, well,
you can't see Jupiter with a tie.

08:51.948 --> 08:57.119
You know, when we need to, pilots,
we use planets to help us navigate.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.956
So we keep a device inside of the cockpit
in case of a malfunction.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.625
-A sextant, right?
-That's exactly right.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.585
My little navigator.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.171
Be better at night, but in the meantime,

09:08.005 --> 09:10.633
maybe we could use this
to spy on the neighbors.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.345
I don't think we should do that.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.431
Yeah, prob-- probably not.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.601
It was just a joke.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.273
-Can I?
-Yeah, sure, please. Yeah.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.653
It's got a mirror inside.
Two mirrors, actually.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.322
You know, you have one mirror
to collect the light, and--

09:33.406 --> 09:35.408
And one that magnifies it.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.785
That's right, son.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.092
I'm not about to sweat out my silky press.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.677
We were moving in such a haste.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.973
You know Charlotte's not going to bed
without Charlotte's headscarf.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.768
I'm going to get organized tomorrow.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.692
That was a good call
on the telescope, baby. Thank you.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.945
Figured the last thing that boy needed

10:13.029 --> 10:16.073
was another baseball
he was going to use as a paperweight.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.452
His age, I'd have given a kidney
for a proper mitt.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.287
Well, he isn't you.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.164
Now is he?

10:23.247 --> 10:25.291
He's too smart for his own good.
That's what he is.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.668
He's just trying to impress you.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.675
That hurt?

10:35.593 --> 10:37.595
What's the exact opposite of hurt?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.768
I do not like being apart.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.148
A part of what?

11:15.132 --> 11:16.467
Is it Dean?

11:16.550 --> 11:18.803
-No.
-Is it Cole from history?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.722
-Hi, guys.
-Come on, Elaine. Just tell us.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.225
What? Tell us what?

11:24.308 --> 11:25.851
We promise we won't tell anyone.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.144
About what?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.689
You guys can just stop asking,
'cause I'm not gonna tell you.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.274
-What are you not telling?
-We're your best friends.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.152
Whoever it is you have this crush on,
you have an obligation to tell us

11:35.236 --> 11:36.987
so we can be happy for you.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.156
Don't you want us to be happy for you?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.367
Yeah. Don't you want us
to be happy for you?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.828
Promise not to laugh.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.122
Cross my heart and hope to die.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.748
Fine.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.962
I think Scotty Mills is turning
into kind of a dreamboat.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.052
See, I knew you guys would laugh.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.431
Well, that was before you told us
it was Scott the Snot.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.808
He hasn't had that problem
since we were kids.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.437
Are you talking about me?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.355
Sorry, I can't breathe very well.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.568
-Oh my God, that's what he sounds like.
-Does something smell?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.319
-I can't smell anything.
-Marge, you're not funny.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.071
Does anybody have a tissue?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.489
Enough, Marge.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.033
Yeah, don't be mean.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.167
Look who's back.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.129
Where does she get the nerve?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.008
I can't sleep knowing that
her dad could just crawl through

12:39.091 --> 12:40.551
my bedroom window at night.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.511
Do you think she knows
where the bodies are?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.055
I was worried about you.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.891
I can't stop thinking about them.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.350
And about that thing.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.397
Good morning, students.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.816
This is Principal Dunleavy speaking.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.611
It's 9:00 a.m.
on another sunny spring day.

13:00.571 --> 13:05.034
Now I would like to thank everyone
who attended last week's candlelight vigil

13:05.117 --> 13:08.913
for Theodore Uris
and Philip and Susie Malkin.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.043
It was an uplifting evening
of prayer and remembrance.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.006
And a strong reminder that as a community,
we can weather any storm.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.845
And the cafeteria will not be serving
its usual sloppy joes.

13:25.679 --> 13:30.726
In its place will be meatloaf,
mashed potatoes, and something green.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.235
Hey.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.487
Hi, Marge.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.698
I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.951
We haven't really talked since, you know,

13:47.034 --> 13:49.161
the thing that happened at the theater.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.288
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.456
Thanks.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.583
Good.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.800
I-- It just-- It feels like
you've been ignoring me.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.136
No, it's just been hard.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.722
I'm sure. I know. I bet.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.601
Take your seats quickly, please.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.026
Look, I saw you,

14:21.110 --> 14:23.654
before, talking to Ronnie Grogan.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.822
So?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.702
So, Patty and the girls
really care about you,

14:29.785 --> 14:31.245
but they don't know you like I do.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.373
They see you getting cozy
with you-know-who's daughter,

14:34.456 --> 14:36.040
they won't understand.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.586
I just...

14:38.669 --> 14:40.838
I know you want things back
to the way they were,

14:40.921 --> 14:43.132
with us, with the Pattycakes,
and I can help.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.468
I want to, but you have to let me.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.679
How about eating lunch with us today?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.266
Phil and Teddy are dead.
Phil's sister is dead.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.061
Who cares about your stupid Pattycakes?

14:58.689 --> 15:03.068
Today, we will be discussing
the four basic food groups

15:03.569 --> 15:05.362
and how to best employ them

15:05.446 --> 15:09.491
to ensure your growing bodies
attain maximum vigor.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.704
Is this Miss Douglas's class?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.791
Sorry, I couldn't find the room. I--

15:17.875 --> 15:20.252
I'm Will Hanlon. I'm new.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.213
Are you new
to the concept of time, Mr. Hanlon?

15:24.298 --> 15:26.050
You mean, like, relativity?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.553
There's no excuse for tardiness.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.348
Next time your grade will reflect it.
Take a seat.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.367
Quiet! Quiet, everyone.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.083
Cedar Pointe.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.669
Good pencil.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.924
-Thanks.
-Eyes forward!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.096
Can I help you, sir?

16:12.179 --> 16:15.808
Yes, Major Hanlon, Sergeant Vice, ma'am.
Colonel Fuller wanted to see me.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.153
Major, come on in.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.531
We searched his quarters,

16:31.073 --> 16:33.200
found the weapon used in your barracks.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.035
He finally admitted to it
under questioning.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.245
Masters?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.706
He's no Soviet spy, of course.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.667
Just an asshole wanting to put a scare

16:41.750 --> 16:44.044
into a colored airman.
But this isn't the South,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.338
and we don't brook that kind of shit here.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.632
We're still trying to figure out
the identities of the other two,

16:48.716 --> 16:50.843
but Masters is a coward.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.220
He'll break, and when he does,

16:53.762 --> 16:57.141
I can promise you, justice will be served.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.184
Thank you.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.978
Thank you, sir.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.530
Sir, that weapon that you recovered,

17:12.614 --> 17:15.992
it was dark in there,
but it looked like a Makarov PM.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.787
Is that right?

17:19.747 --> 17:20.789
You have a good eye.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.917
It was a Makarov,
old Soviet piece of shit.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.963
-Why?
-Nothing, just...

17:28.881 --> 17:32.092
one day, when I'm telling my grandkids
that I stared into the face of death,

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
I want to have all the details.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.502
-Good morning.
-Morning.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.960
Suck an egg, Paul Bunyan!

18:59.346 --> 19:03.058
Personally, I don't mind it.
I mean, it's Paul Bunyan for Pete's sake.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.685
He's an American hero.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.853
I'll be right with you, miss.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.855
He's an eyesore.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.398
And I won't stand for it,

19:09.481 --> 19:12.317
and neither will any of
the other grandes dames of Derry.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.903
That statue has got to go.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
Well, you know what I say?

19:18.198 --> 19:19.533
Let the pigeons sort it out.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.036
There you are, Mrs. Cavanaugh.
On your tab.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.913
You have a good day now.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.875
How can I help you, miss?

19:27.958 --> 19:30.544
-Yes, I'd like to make a roast tonight.
-Sounds heavenly.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.962
Are we talking chuck or round?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.423
Rump, please, for three.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.549
Okay.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.555
So you passing through?

19:41.638 --> 19:43.640
I actually just moved in.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.936
I suppose I do really
stick out around here.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.857
Oh gosh, I didn't mean it that way.
It's just... been here a lot of years.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.069
You see the same faces, day in, day out.
It's nice to have a little bit of variety.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.156
Stan Kersh.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.824
Kids call me Stanley Cleaver.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.201
Cute.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.246
-Well, I'm Charlotte. Hanlon.
-Well...

20:08.207 --> 20:10.417
-Welcome to Derry, Mrs. Hanlon.
-Thank you.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.085
He's getting away. Get him!

20:22.054 --> 20:25.349
-Why is no one stopping this?
-Boys will be boys.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.725
What are you gonna do?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.063
Hey! Hey!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.898
Hey!

20:36.026 --> 20:37.986
You leave that boy alone, you hear me?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.291
-He's getting away, get him.
-Leave him alone!

21:04.763 --> 21:07.933
Don't tell me boys will be boys.
How about boys will be kind?

21:08.016 --> 21:10.352
Boys will stand up. Boys will be tall

21:10.978 --> 21:12.938
in their integrity and their hearts.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.026
Boys will be measured by their mommas
in their new house.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.237
Come on.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.118
It was pathetic, Leroy.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.079
Nobody seemed bothered
by it in the slightest.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.873
And then when I shouted, they looked
at me like I was the crazy one.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.875
Dogs. That's what they looked like,

21:33.959 --> 21:36.837
a bunch of starving dogs
getting ready to tear

21:36.962 --> 21:38.547
at a piece of fresh meat.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.801
What were they doing
outside of school in the first place?

21:43.885 --> 21:46.763
I got about a half a mind
to track those kids' parents down

21:46.847 --> 21:48.015
and give them the what for.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.474
Please don't.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.770
Did anything like that happen
for you today at school?

21:53.854 --> 21:54.896
Any bullies?

21:56.189 --> 21:57.733
No. Mom...

21:57.816 --> 21:59.943
This isn't about embarrassing you.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.112
This is about what's right and wrong.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.990
And isn't it wrong to embarrass
your only son the first week of school?

22:05.073 --> 22:06.867
Don't get cute with me.
You didn't see those kids.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.201
Yeah, the boy's right, Char.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.078
You should just--
You should leave it alone.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.496
Is that an order, Major?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.290
Well, after Shreveport,
I think the last thing

22:13.373 --> 22:15.876
-that you need to get is involved--
-Can you guys stop fighting?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.419
-We're not fighting.
-We're not fighting.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.713
-We're talking.
-We're talking.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.007
-That's just how we talk.
-That's just how we talk.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.264
Can I be excused?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.727
We didn't get to hear
how your first day went.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.773
It was fine, Mom. Okay? Can I go now?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.487
It's all right. Go on, son.

22:44.821 --> 22:45.822
Go.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.624
Excuse me?

22:56.208 --> 22:59.336
We're all off living
separate lives most of the day.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.298
And all I ask
is for a little family time at night.

23:04.299 --> 23:07.219
And please don't bring up Shreveport
like we didn't move here for you.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.929
So that brick through our car window,

23:09.012 --> 23:10.722
-was that for me too, Char?
-So it's my fault now?

23:10.806 --> 23:14.101
I'm not the one that's causing trouble.
I'm not the one that's making signs.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.020
I'm not the one that's sitting
in places where I'm not wanted.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.817
What is with you tonight?
Why are you coming at me like this?

23:26.613 --> 23:29.741
I'm sorry, baby. I... I had a day is all.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.160
Okay, you want to talk about it?

23:34.788 --> 23:37.332
-You know I can't.
-Yeah, I know.

23:41.545 --> 23:45.090
All this bullshit,
police sneaking around outside our house,

23:45.173 --> 23:47.551
harassing us, day in and day out.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.428
Momma, Ronnie's sleeping.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.012
Don't you shush me!

23:51.596 --> 23:53.932
You ain't the only one
with the keys to that theater.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.475
Cal? You-- You serious?

23:55.559 --> 23:57.811
-Or that stingy man who owns the place.
-Come on, Momma.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.230
You think they got police
outside their houses?

24:00.313 --> 24:03.024
-I don't know. But we--
-That's bullshit, and you know it!

24:03.108 --> 24:04.484
Momma, please keep it down.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.279
You know what the difference
between them and you is?

24:07.362 --> 24:08.864
You look in the mirror lately?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.532
Ronnie is trying to sleep.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.215
You tore me apart, Ronnie.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.758
Mommy?

25:52.300 --> 25:55.220
You came out of me
and ripped me right open.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.347
Why'd you do it?

26:00.642 --> 26:03.603
All I wanted was to hold my baby.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.109
And you killed me.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.695
Like you killed those kids.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.823
Like you're gonna kill your father.

26:18.743 --> 26:19.995
They'll come for him.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.163
They'll take him away.

26:22.289 --> 26:26.001
And he'll fry!

26:27.669 --> 26:28.878
I'm sorry, Mommy!

26:32.716 --> 26:35.302
Come to momma!

27:17.636 --> 27:19.054
Look at the mess you made.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.907
You okay? You're safe.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.076
Everything okay?

27:41.159 --> 27:42.994
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.789
It's okay. Breathe. Breathe.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.833
It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.377
Man, that's bullshit.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.754
Like I'm gonna help someone
beat up another colored airman.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.131
I mean... Have you seen me?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.801
Have you seen me?
I ain't got nothing to be jealous of.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.637
Listen, I don't know what it was,

28:01.137 --> 28:03.765
but I guarantee y'all,
it was some cracker shit.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.558
I agree with you.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.061
Coming to me,
asking me like I did something.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.771
I'm as clean as a whistle.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.732
-Reggie, ain't nothing clean about you.
-Please.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.527
But, man, they questioned my ass
damn near an hour.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.611
They hitting up everybody.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.115
What the hell you think
this is all about?

28:21.241 --> 28:22.951
Don't see, don't say.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.994
Go along to get along, you dig?

28:27.914 --> 28:29.541
All the way to China, baby.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.589
-Whoa.
-You all right there, Bernie?

28:37.215 --> 28:38.675
So how long they question you for?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.052
They didn't.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.638
Then what'd you do all day?

28:44.264 --> 28:45.473
I can't talk about that.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.768
Super-secret spy mission.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.820
Man, you full of shit.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.532
Okay. We'll see. I'm telling you.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.244
I forgot...

29:08.455 --> 29:09.456
Elmer.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.263
Chief.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.266
Dan.

29:29.893 --> 29:30.935
Councilman.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.730
-You arrest him yet?
-Who's that?

29:34.272 --> 29:36.983
The Negro. From the movie house.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.111
Investigation's ongoing.

29:40.987 --> 29:42.614
Everybody knows he hurt those kids.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.908
Think about the parents, Chief.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.286
Grieving, no body to bury,

29:48.870 --> 29:50.622
and you sitting here
having a nip off the clock.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.249
You think I'm not doing everything I can
to place him there that night?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.752
I've got no evidence,
and he's got an alibi.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.629
-This is America.
-This ain't America.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.756
This is Derry.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.802
Do your job, or come next election,

30:04.344 --> 30:06.137
we'll find somebody else who will.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.156
Elmer.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.460
Time to go.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.462
Go? I'm just getting start--

30:44.968 --> 30:46.678
Where we supposed to go
to relax around here?

30:46.761 --> 30:49.180
Don't worry. I know somebody
that can help us out.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.058
Long as you fellas can handle
a little moonshine.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.518
I don't know about that, man.

30:53.601 --> 30:57.105
-That shit's kind of strong.
-Yeah? Well, so am I.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.815
Got that old...

30:59.983 --> 31:01.025
Okay.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.363
Hey, hush up, man.
You gonna get us written up.

31:05.446 --> 31:06.990
For what? Feeling good?

31:07.073 --> 31:09.701
You ain't gonna feel so good
when they throw your ass in the stockade.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.077
Get rid of that shit.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.374
Come on, now.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.542
Straighten up.

31:24.674 --> 31:28.303
IDs. What are you fellas doing out?

31:29.596 --> 31:30.805
Base is on lockdown.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.057
Nobody's allowed on or off
without special permission.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.060
Yeah, well, we've all been
questioned and cleared.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.815
Don't move. Any of you.
We'll let the OD sort this out.

31:42.275 --> 31:46.487
Okay, but you be sure
to let him know Dick Hallorann's out here.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.365
-Got myself some special privileges.
-My ass.

31:50.658 --> 31:51.868
Stay right over there.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.661
Yes, sir.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.955
Master Sergeant Deavers
down here at the south gate.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.458
I got three drunk airmen here,
snuck off base.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.336
Need you to send someone.
Guy named Hallorann.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.254
-That's right.
-Dick Hallorann?

32:03.338 --> 32:04.297
Dick, yeah.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.257
-Do you like your job, Master Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.009
I will, sir.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.058
You're clear.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.893
Straight to quarters.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.148
Thank you, sir.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.151
Super-secret spy mission.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.487
You weren't kidding, were you?

32:28.655 --> 32:30.698
What the hell
they got you doing, Hallorann?

33:33.177 --> 33:35.805
Looking a little green around
the gills there, Hallorann.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.434
No complaints, sir.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.645
Well, I've got one.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.773
This is the fourth dig site
in as many months.

33:46.482 --> 33:50.194
I'm getting tired of dragging my ass out
into the middle of the woods for scraps.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.196
You might be fooling some
of the people around here

33:52.280 --> 33:54.407
with these so-called gifts of yours,
but the only gifts I see

33:54.490 --> 33:57.118
are the ones that the U.S. government
feels fit to bestow upon you

33:57.201 --> 33:58.745
with nothing to show for it in return.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.622
Maybe you're dragging things
out a bit, huh?

34:01.706 --> 34:03.750
Enjoying those special privileges
a little too much?

34:05.209 --> 34:06.711
We can fix that real quick.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.047
We're close.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.132
We're close. I can feel it.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.677
You better hope so.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.897
These beans taste disgusting.

35:07.980 --> 35:11.484
-Tastes like rats' balls.
-No way, it's worse than that.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.028
Tastes like Principal Dunleavy's butt.

35:26.749 --> 35:27.792
We need to talk.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.919
Hey, what's wrong?

35:30.002 --> 35:32.964
That thing. It came back.

35:34.924 --> 35:35.967
When?

35:38.636 --> 35:41.597
Hey, get a load of Square Central.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.395
What's she doing
with Hatchet Hank's kid?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.649
I thought you said
she wasn't crazy anymore.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.155
I don't know. She seemed better.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.490
Wonder what they're talking about.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.119
Probably planning another murder.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.037
Maybe we're next.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.467
Marge! Oh my God!

36:19.468 --> 36:20.761
Hey, Margie.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.930
Weren't you wearing
that sweater yesterday?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.935
Are you hurt?

36:28.811 --> 36:30.062
No, but...

36:32.106 --> 36:33.691
it said things.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.568
Like what?

36:35.651 --> 36:38.237
That they're going to come for my dad,

36:38.863 --> 36:42.241
take him away, and that... that he'll fry.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.163
Look, everyone knows your dad
had nothing to do with this.

36:47.246 --> 36:50.583
When the cops asked me,
I told them he wasn't even there.

36:50.666 --> 36:53.002
You told them what you told me, right?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.546
They asked what happened, and I...

36:56.214 --> 36:58.466
You know,
I said I wasn't really sure, but...

36:58.549 --> 37:01.385
But you told me
a monster came out of that screen.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.470
You told me!

37:02.553 --> 37:04.597
Hey, let's do the Pattycakes.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.685
I don't know exactly what I saw, okay?

37:09.769 --> 37:12.146
But it wasn't your dad,
and that's what matters.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.773
And I told them so.

37:13.856 --> 37:16.150
"I don't know what I saw" sounds
like you're too scared to tell.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.111
Come on, Marge. Join in.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.280
If you don't tell them the truth soon,

37:21.364 --> 37:22.949
they're gonna decide
what happened that night

37:23.032 --> 37:24.951
-and take my dad away.
-And if I do tell them,

37:25.034 --> 37:27.536
they'll think I'm crazy and take me away.

37:29.747 --> 37:33.042
You don't know, Ronnie,
what it was like in that place.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.630
I can't go through that again.

37:37.713 --> 37:40.216
This is my dad's life we're talking about.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.051
I told them he wasn't there.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.595
That's all I can do.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

37:45.221 --> 37:49.183
And I'm sure we both know
that's some bullshit!

37:51.435 --> 37:53.312
Excuse me, young lady.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.109
You're coming with me.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.672
You can't sit there. It's saved.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.720
This spot of the floor?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.600
It's not saved. It's the floor.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.103
You can't save the floor.
Who would it be saved for?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.772
I don't know. Your friends?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.817
My friends. Sure.

38:42.778 --> 38:43.779
Whatcha reading?

38:44.905 --> 38:47.450
101 Scientific Facts by Thomas Inwood.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.327
Hello?

39:35.081 --> 39:37.500
-Hello?
-Hi.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.128
Science. Cool.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.506
Why's the sky blue?

39:43.589 --> 39:47.718
Well, my dad says it's 'cause God's a boy,
otherwise it would be pink.

39:51.138 --> 39:52.681
That's an interesting theory.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.142
I'm Rich, by the way.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.936
Will.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.605
Do you always eat lunch out here?

40:03.109 --> 40:05.361
You might want to run now.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.758
You again!

40:36.392 --> 40:37.893
See you tomorrow, Rose!

40:40.020 --> 40:43.983
Baseball cards, bowling ball, biwa.

40:50.948 --> 40:56.078
Carafe, cups, cards, clock.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.998
-May I help you?
-What a lovely shop.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.207
Thank you.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.378
So are you looking for anything
in particular?

41:04.462 --> 41:07.298
You know, you actually sold
a telescope to my husband,

41:07.381 --> 41:09.300
-I think, last week.
-I remember.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.218
Very polite.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.763
Got the feeling he might be
in the military.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.183
Yeah. Don't hold it against him.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.060
My family and I just moved to town,

41:20.144 --> 41:22.938
and we're looking for things
to fill the place, so...

41:24.190 --> 41:26.734
-You have a son, right?
-Yeah.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.904
Will, he's 12. He'll be 13 in August.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.742
Well, I normally close up
right now for lunch,

41:34.825 --> 41:37.661
but for a return customer.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.039
-Feel free to look around.
-Thank you so much.

41:53.928 --> 41:54.970
I'm sorry.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.349
Sorry, I stink, I know.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.810
I mean, you threw a stink bomb
on your second day at school.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.437
What? No.

42:04.021 --> 42:07.066
No, I didn't do it, okay?
I just got blamed.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.028
Why are you here?

42:12.196 --> 42:13.197
Cussing.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.991
Were you wrongfully accused too?

42:16.617 --> 42:18.077
No, I'm guilty as hell.

42:23.582 --> 42:26.001
-I'm Will.
-Ronnie.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.174
You know you don't have
to do that in here.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.885
They don't care, long as we stay put.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.013
Right. Thanks.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.643
That's not on our syllabus.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.146
Really?

42:47.314 --> 42:49.316
Guess I must have gotten an old syllabus.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.570
-Are you reading that for fun?
-No.

42:53.112 --> 42:55.573
-No, I just--
-You're lying.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.658
This has gotta be the first time
a kid in this school

42:57.741 --> 43:00.619
has lied about doing schoolwork
to cover up doing more boring reading.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.204
It's not boring.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.753
All right, then what is it?

43:11.171 --> 43:13.507
Well, science is interesting.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.718
Take that stink bomb.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.721
You know it's made up
of many different chemicals, right?

43:19.638 --> 43:22.641
Mostly ammonium disulfide
and some other stuff.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.518
But the point is, those chemicals,

43:24.602 --> 43:27.771
it's the same exact stuff that makes up
the clouds around Jupiter and Venus.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.610
So, yeah, maybe I smell bad.

43:33.402 --> 43:35.654
Or maybe I'm just covered in stardust.

43:40.534 --> 43:42.786
-You're weird.
-Takes one to know one.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.580
-What happened?
-What's going on?

43:44.663 --> 43:47.249
-Why are the police here?
-Does anyone know where Lilly is?

43:47.875 --> 43:48.876
They're taking her away.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.587
What's going on?

44:04.808 --> 44:06.727
Do you know her?

44:30.334 --> 44:32.419
I didn't see Mr. Grogan that night.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.382
-I already told you.
-Yes, you did. You told me.

44:37.966 --> 44:40.844
Lilly, those families,
they deserve justice, don't you think?

44:43.597 --> 44:46.308
A lot of people out there
in the community, they're frustrated.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.770
People get frustrated,
they start getting funny ideas.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.315
Thing is, Lilly, you got
a little bit of a reputation in town.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.025
Now, don't misunderstand me.

44:55.609 --> 44:58.654
All right. Folks...
folks get what you've been through.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.115
Your daddy like that...

45:02.449 --> 45:04.243
in pieces, it's just...

45:04.326 --> 45:07.121
Well, things no little girl
should ever have to deal with.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.207
The people know that. They know that.
But they also know...

45:11.333 --> 45:12.960
They also know about after.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.629
About your time at Juniper Hill.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.673
And if what you say is true

45:17.756 --> 45:21.468
and Mr. Grogan wasn't there
in the auditorium, well,

45:21.552 --> 45:24.638
it doesn't take long
before the only witness

45:25.264 --> 45:27.474
starts to sound a little more like...

45:28.642 --> 45:29.935
the only suspect.

45:32.229 --> 45:35.482
You think I had something to do with this.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.026
No. No, no, no. God, no.

45:39.319 --> 45:44.032
But people hear stories
about a girl with emotional problems

45:45.075 --> 45:47.453
found covered in her friend's blood,

45:47.953 --> 45:50.789
and, well, you can see
how this doesn't look good.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.542
I didn't. I swear.

45:55.502 --> 45:56.837
Here's what we're gonna do.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.632
We're gonna send you back to Juniper Hill.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.509
-What?
-Check you in for an evaluation.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.803
Just a couple of days,
then everybody else can see

46:04.887 --> 46:06.305
they're barking up the wrong tree.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.806
No, no, please.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.058
I can't.

46:10.559 --> 46:11.685
I don't...

46:13.145 --> 46:15.564
-Please don't send me back.
-I don't want to, Lilly.

46:15.647 --> 46:16.940
I don't, but I...

46:20.819 --> 46:21.862
Tell you what.

46:22.821 --> 46:24.573
How about I ask you one more time?

46:24.656 --> 46:26.283
I'll even rephrase the question

46:26.366 --> 46:28.744
if that'll make it easier
for you, all right?

46:28.827 --> 46:30.370
I'm not gonna ask you

46:30.913 --> 46:34.291
if you saw Hank Grogan there
at the theater that night.

46:34.374 --> 46:36.460
What I'm gonna ask you is...

46:38.962 --> 46:42.257
can you be absolutely, positively certain

46:43.425 --> 46:44.718
that he wasn't there?

46:48.764 --> 46:49.973
This ain't right.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.643
He didn't do nothing to those kids!

46:52.726 --> 46:54.770
Mrs. Grogan, we have good reason
to bring him in.

46:54.853 --> 46:56.438
-We need to ask him some questions.
-Come on.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.606
Don't interfere.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.942
-Daddy! Daddy! No! No!
-It's going to be okay, baby.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.485
-No!
-It's going to be okay.

47:01.568 --> 47:03.821
-Daddy! No! No!
-It's going to be okay. I'll be back.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.447
I'll be back, okay? I'll be back.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.657
-Don't worry about it.
-Daddy!

47:06.740 --> 47:07.950
-It's going to be okay.
-Come on.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.202
-Momma, watch my baby!
-No!

47:10.285 --> 47:12.454
-I'll be ba--
-No!

47:14.248 --> 47:15.415
Daddy!

47:16.792 --> 47:17.835
No!

47:19.294 --> 47:20.587
Go home!

47:22.005 --> 47:23.340
Ought to be ashamed.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.801
Feeding on other people's pain.

47:27.302 --> 47:28.512
Go home!

47:30.889 --> 47:33.433
Ronnie, baby, come back.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.237
What do you think you're doing?
Do you know what time it is?

47:45.320 --> 47:46.530
Where is she?

47:48.198 --> 47:49.741
What did you tell them?

47:50.242 --> 47:52.035
What did you say?

47:52.119 --> 47:54.037
I didn't. He tricked me.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.123
And I didn't know what to do.

47:56.206 --> 47:58.208
-What is this about?
-This is about my daddy!

47:58.292 --> 47:59.751
They took my daddy away!

47:59.835 --> 48:02.254
Enough! Go home
before I call your grandmother!

48:05.007 --> 48:06.216
No!

48:11.054 --> 48:12.222
What'd you say?

48:12.306 --> 48:15.350
You know he didn't do it! You know it!

48:16.518 --> 48:18.604
What did you do, Lilly Bainbridge?

48:47.049 --> 48:48.300
You have a visitor.

48:55.807 --> 48:56.892
Staff Sergeant.

48:56.975 --> 48:58.936
How did you get in here?

48:59.603 --> 49:02.397
What, all you fellas
sticking together now, is that it?

49:04.399 --> 49:06.360
You come to get your pound of flesh?

49:07.778 --> 49:11.031
Well, come on in, Poitier. Water's fine.

49:16.536 --> 49:19.206
What? You come all this way
to chicken out?

49:20.290 --> 49:22.042
-Hey, what the hell?
-Relax.

49:23.168 --> 49:24.336
The magazine's empty.

49:30.592 --> 49:31.718
This one's not.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.263
-Guard!
-I'm not gonna shoot you.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.603
Now, that is a Makarov PM.

49:43.188 --> 49:45.732
It's the same model that you put
in my face the other night.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.693
This one's mine.

49:48.735 --> 49:51.279
A souvenir from my time
in a North Korean POW camp.

49:51.363 --> 49:52.656
I'm crying.

49:53.323 --> 49:54.449
Now, the PM,

49:54.950 --> 49:56.535
she's standard issue
east of the Berlin Wall,

49:56.618 --> 49:57.953
but not too common around here.

49:58.036 --> 50:00.706
It's a difficult piece to handle.
It's even harder to load.

50:01.331 --> 50:03.583
Takes two hands and a couple tries
on a good day.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.503
-So?
-So...

50:07.504 --> 50:09.965
you cocked that gun...
in less than a second.

50:10.590 --> 50:13.385
And I've seen trained Korean officers
take longer than that.

50:15.387 --> 50:17.514
Masters, I don't know
what you're doing here,

50:18.056 --> 50:20.267
but you sure as hell weren't
in my room the other night.

50:23.603 --> 50:26.565
So you think that
I don't want your Black ass

50:26.648 --> 50:28.525
-out of here?
-I believe that.

50:29.609 --> 50:32.029
But I pulled your file,
and near as I can tell,

50:32.112 --> 50:34.072
you can barely strip down an M16,

50:34.156 --> 50:36.742
much less handle a Soviet pistol
like you're married to it.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.495
There's a lot of interesting things
in that file.

50:40.579 --> 50:42.998
Article 15s up the wazoo for everything

50:43.081 --> 50:46.084
from drunk on duty to punching out NCOs.

50:49.004 --> 50:50.756
Your momma must be real proud.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.632
You leave my momma outta this.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.551
Sure.

50:55.677 --> 50:58.013
Just as long
as I don't have to leave this...

50:58.764 --> 50:59.890
out your momma.

51:13.612 --> 51:14.613
That's what I thought.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.169
General, do you have a moment
for Major Hanlon?

51:29.252 --> 51:30.253
Send him in.

51:33.548 --> 51:36.134
-General.
-Major, have a seat.

51:36.218 --> 51:38.595
That won't be necessary, sir.
I just thought you should know

51:38.678 --> 51:40.597
you have an innocent man
locked in the stockade.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.767
He's a racist asshole, but he's innocent.

51:44.518 --> 51:47.562
-Bastard signed a confession.
-Yeah, well, he lied, sir.

51:49.564 --> 51:52.067
-He told you that?
-In so many words.

51:53.235 --> 51:56.696
I'm going to file a report with OSI
to request a further investigation.

51:56.780 --> 51:57.781
I see.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.743
-Will that be all, Major?
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.082
Major Hanlon.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.420
Why don't you have that seat now?

52:31.148 --> 52:32.399
I needed to know.

52:34.067 --> 52:36.570
If word of your brain injury
in South Korea were true.

52:37.362 --> 52:39.156
And Major, you did not disappoint.

52:40.615 --> 52:42.033
A damaged amygdala.

52:42.701 --> 52:45.078
Fifty years in the field
and I've never heard of such a thing.

52:48.874 --> 52:52.669
I've spent enough time in combat
to know a brave man when I see one.

52:53.587 --> 52:57.382
But you, Major...
are the rarest of creatures.

52:58.049 --> 52:59.301
A man without fear.

53:00.427 --> 53:03.638
And I've been looking for someone like you
for a long, long time.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.142
It was a test, son.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.561
And you passed.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.731
I think I heard enough.

53:12.814 --> 53:15.108
-Now hold on.
-Who was in the masks?

53:16.109 --> 53:17.110
Does it matter?

53:17.194 --> 53:20.530
Do I want to know who beat me
with a metal pipe? Yes, sir, I do.

53:20.614 --> 53:23.825
It wasn't supposed
to happen like that, and I am sorry.

53:23.909 --> 53:26.703
But I promised anonymity,
and I don't burn my people.

53:27.245 --> 53:28.413
And Masters?

53:29.789 --> 53:31.041
He wasn't there.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.294
I understand.
You're obligated to report me.

53:35.003 --> 53:38.256
But before you do, I would ask
you take ten minutes to hear me out.

54:08.787 --> 54:12.582
You'll find Gingham dog food,
bigger flavor, smaller price.

54:12.666 --> 54:15.377
And remember, cats love it too.

54:16.044 --> 54:18.380
-Hi, Lilly.
-Hi, Mr. Janko.

54:18.463 --> 54:21.216
-Your mother sent you shopping again?
-She's working a double shift.

54:21.299 --> 54:23.551
If you need anything up high, ask.

54:23.635 --> 54:24.636
Thanks.

54:25.178 --> 54:27.889
On aisle seven, Fizz-A-Lot soda pop.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.725
Buy two for the price of one.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.107
And don't forget to pick up
your SpaghettiOs

54:37.190 --> 54:38.650
in the canned food section.

54:49.327 --> 54:51.579
Mr. Bubble bubble bath at half price

54:51.663 --> 54:52.872
until the end of the week.

54:58.753 --> 55:00.297
Say hello to The Green Giant.

55:01.172 --> 55:03.842
Green beans on sale in aisle six.

55:13.476 --> 55:14.602
Crazy.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.110
You'll find Gingham dog food,

55:22.193 --> 55:23.778
bigger flavor, smaller price.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.531
And remember, cats love it too.

55:30.076 --> 55:33.121
Gingham dog food,
bigger flavor, smaller...

55:33.204 --> 55:34.581
Your daddy misses you.

55:34.664 --> 55:35.915
And remember, cats love it too.

55:40.712 --> 55:43.256
On aisle seven, Fizz-A-Lot soda pop.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.175
Buy two for the price of one.

55:49.095 --> 55:50.347
You should be locked up.

55:52.140 --> 55:54.017
Campbell's tomato soup.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.478
Look for the red can in aisle six.

56:01.191 --> 56:03.902
Don't forget to pick up your SpaghettiOs

56:03.985 --> 56:05.612
in the canned food section.

56:08.031 --> 56:10.784
Mr. Bubble bubble bath at half price

56:10.867 --> 56:12.327
until the end of the week.

56:19.751 --> 56:21.086
You're insane.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.962
You should go back to Juniper Hill.

56:23.046 --> 56:24.631
Lilly Bainbridge...

56:25.965 --> 56:27.634
Have you lost your marbles?

56:28.676 --> 56:31.012
There's a special on marbles
on aisle eight!

56:31.554 --> 56:33.014
You can't leave here.

56:33.890 --> 56:35.934
-You're a danger!
-You're stuck here!

56:36.893 --> 56:38.311
She's insane.

56:40.730 --> 56:42.148
She's crazy.

56:42.774 --> 56:45.026
-Did you know that?
-I know you do.

56:46.152 --> 56:47.737
You wanna see your daddy?

56:49.739 --> 56:50.949
Crazy.

57:54.512 --> 57:55.722
Daddy?

57:58.683 --> 58:00.435
There's my little girl.

58:06.774 --> 58:08.526
Got a kiss for daddy?

58:42.477 --> 58:43.978
No!

58:55.156 --> 58:56.533
No!

58:57.242 --> 58:59.077
No! No! No!

59:00.745 --> 59:02.789
Hello, crazy!

59:03.831 --> 59:09.462
Just one kiss for Papa!

59:09.546 --> 59:12.840
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

59:16.844 --> 59:18.096
Lilly Bainbridge!

59:20.807 --> 59:22.809
What the hell's wrong with you?

59:42.453 --> 59:44.247
-Open the gate.
-Yes, sir.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.639
What is all this?

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:04.100
Bear with me, Major.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.645
Earlier this year,
the Cubans and the Soviets

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:11.357
-held an agricultural summit in Havana.
-I remember hearing about it in the news.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.985
Well, what you didn't hear about
was the true purpose of that meeting.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.696
It was to devise a plan
to place nuclear warheads

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.948
within striking distance
of the United States.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.702
With launch capabilities in Cuba,
the Soviets could hit every major city

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.329
in the United States within minutes.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.248
What you're about to see

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.876
may be our best
and only hope to prevent that.

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:48.269
Gentlemen. Dismissed.

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:52.940
Welcome to Operation Precept.

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.486
A classified DOD crash program
with a single purpose.

01:00:57.236 --> 01:01:00.198
To win the Cold War
before the first missile is ever fired.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.326
You're building a weapon?

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:06.496
Close. We're looking for one.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:11.125
Something that was buried
in Derry a long time ago.

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:16.547
Something that you, Major, are
uniquely qualified to help us retrieve.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:18.841
How's that?

01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:25.556
This weapon,
it generates debilitating fear.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.142
In anyone who comes near it.

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:30.770
In theory, it could scare a man
badly enough

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.355
to kill him where he stands.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.357
But what is it?

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.609
Some kind of machine?

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:40.697
We don't know everything about it.
Where it came from, how it works.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:42.990
What we do know

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.494
is that it's surrounded
on all sides by a group of objects.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.538
Think of them as beacons.

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.081
If we can find them,

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:53.501
they'll help us pinpoint
the exact location of the weapon itself.

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:55.294
And at that moment...

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:58.756
we need you there, Major,
to help us secure it.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.597
-Yes, Colonel, what is it?
-Apologies for the interruption.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.766
We just received word from the dig site.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.185
Reports are still coming in,
but it appears

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:13.146
they found something.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.653
-Join us, Major?
-Yes, sir.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.175
Mom, please.

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:46.804
Don't make me go.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.423
I told you.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.569
We're close.
