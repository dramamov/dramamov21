00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.410
Elder Tang,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.740
I'll give you three moves to think it over.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.180
Within three moves,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.130
Blood River is still willing

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.330
to befriend the Tang Clan.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.330
After three moves,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.460
we settle it by life and death.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.100
Su Muyu's here...

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.450
He's here!

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.610
You folks from the Tang Clan

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.410
are really something.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.980
You shout before you strike.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.260
Even your hidden weapons are used so openly.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.010
Shout or not,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.850
I'm just as confident I'll beat you.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.940
Su Muyu,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.170
you finally showed up!

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.980
Xuewei...

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.260
Xuewei was taken by them!

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.820
Why did they take her?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.380
Seems

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.060
they want the poison in her.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.260
We'll talk after we're back.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.380
You're not leaving!

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.380
For our companion in your hands,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.060
you'd better keep her

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.060
safe and sound!

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.410
I hate to admit it,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.940
but it's the truth:

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.010
we simply can't stop

You jinx.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.900
I'm just exhausted.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.780
I'm the head of a house.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.250
I don't die that easily.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.660
Qingyang,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.850
what happened?

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.660
Where's Xuewei?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.170
Why didn't she come back with you?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.020
Xuewei...

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.580
Xuewei was taken.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.730
The one who took her

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.490
is the one Mr. Su mentioned,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.340
the physician who refines drugged puppets.

So she's in Jin City too.

How interesting.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.780
Anyway,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.040
we need a plan

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.050
to get Xuewei out first.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.340
Night Crow took Xuewei

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.540
for the poison in her body.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.290
With her methods,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.220
Xuewei will be put through hell.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.290
And the two of them now

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.610
are surely inside the Tang Clan.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.730
Looks like our betrothal

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.850
has to be put on hold.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.930
We should check the Tang Clan first.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.100
Here in Jin City,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.460
you still let him get away?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.930
Blood River's arrival

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.220

once settled.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.460
We have to hold them in check.

Don't let them ruin our plan.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.660
But, Madam,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.730
Mu Xuewei is in Night Crow's hands.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.980
And Night Crow...

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.370
This is the Tang Clan.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.370
Do we really have to take our cues from her?

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.370
If she wants to do anything,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.100
she has three days to finish.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.980
After that,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.170
hand Mu Xuewei over intact.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.780
As you command, Madam.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.660
Please be very careful, Madam.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.980
I hear Blood River's Su Changhe

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.850
is a nasty opponent.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.610
They say

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.460
he's a schemer,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.410
putting profit first in all things.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.290
I'm not afraid of men like that.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.100
I only fear people who reason.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.490
After all,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.930
Su Changhe and I

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.810
are the same kind of man.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.050
He's just luckier than me

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.290
and took the top seat of Blood River.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.340
But soon,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.730
the Tang Sect's seat of power

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.340

[Tang Lingzun of Tang Clan]

Senior,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.100
this is the poisonous person

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.900
our Master once mentioned.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.850
I searched the world

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.850
and never met a single one.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.810
Who knows,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.080
here in Jin City,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.410
I'd run right into one.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.850
If I pair a poisonous person

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.580
with my drugged puppet craft,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.100
what a terrifying thing that will make.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.050
Senior,

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.050
in medicine,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.100
you're far above me.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.410
But in the dark arts,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.100
you're nowhere near me.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.660
Look, Senior.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.220
These two drugged puppets

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.460
were Vajra Mortal-Stage masters in life.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.460
Refined into puppets,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.850
they don't die or feel pain.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.100
And now,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.490
with toxins from this "Poisonous Blossom",

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.020
I'll reforge them

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.660
into poison-laced drugged puppets.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.780
One hit from them

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.540
and anyone

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.020
won't last a stick of incense.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.340
You...

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.890
Ms Night Crow.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.580
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.980
The Madam wants

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.420
to invite Blood River to meet,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.850
and...

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.700
offer a meeting gift.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.580
A meeting gift?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.850
Seems that gift

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.820
has something to do with me.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.890
Yes.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.130
The gift is Mu Xuewei herself.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.130
Ms Night Crow,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.460
Blood River isn't easy

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.580
to negotiate with.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.220
So...

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.730
we ask for your understanding.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.370
Understanding?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.460
Without me,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.340
could you have subdued Tang Linghuang?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.770
And now you ask me to "understand"?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.610
Is Blood River so fearsome?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.610
Once,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.270
I nearly killed

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.540
that Su family head.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.060
Per the Madam,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.060
she doesn't wish to clash with Blood River yet.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.980
So she wants

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.490
Mu Xuewei handed over

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.180
safe and sound

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.650
three days from now.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.980
Within those three days,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.530
she hopes...

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.460
you'll finish whatever you intend.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.580
Sir,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.820
Master Su,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.580
these Tang Clan people

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.770
are something else.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.490
Force first, courtesy after.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.220
This morning

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.220
they chased our folks to kill,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.060
and by night

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.130
they sent a handwritten letter to sue for peace.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.610
Have they found us here?

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.340
Not quite.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.580
The Tang Clan knows

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.030
Blood River has people

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.210
in Jin City.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.610
But they don't know

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.700
this teahouse

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.130
is our stronghold.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.700
So,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.340
finding Blood River folk

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.130
won't be easy,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.520
but getting a letter

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.890
into Blood River hands

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.980
is hardly difficult.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.490
What does the letter say?

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.420
"From Chief Tang Fulu of Execution Hall:

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.370
We invite Blood River's Patriarch

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.420
Su Changhe

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.530
and Su family head Su Muyu

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.340
to meet at Dengjin Tower

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.730
in Jin City

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.460
for urgent discussions".

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.940
Chief of Execution Hall?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.340
How interesting.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.040
Since when does an Execution Hall chief

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.300
get to invite Blood River's Patriarch

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.130
and family head?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.370
Looks like

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.340
Tang Linghuang is either dead

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.420
or trapped.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.180
Behind Tang Fulu,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.770
there must be someone

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.980
of very high rank

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.300
inside the Tang Clan.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.060
What do you think?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.300
Factions in the Tang Clan are tangled.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.770
Aside from Second Master Tang and Tang Lianyue,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.700
Blood River has no ties

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.530
with the rest of them.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.530
With no feud between us,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.130
why'd they fight us to the death?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.180
Besides,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.100
Blood River's Patriarch

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.700
is here in Jin City in person.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.420
They naturally feel

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.420
this clash isn't necessary.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.650
That's not thanks to me.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.460
I'm guessing they don't know I'm here.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.770
This handwritten letter is a probe.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.010
After all, for years

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.180
we've always shown up together.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.010
What made them decide

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.700
not to be our enemy for now

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.700
was the force you showed

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.940
outside Jin City.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.580
Will you go

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.700
to this banquet?

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.060
Of course.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.100
We'll have to meet them anyway.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.010
Besides,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.340
we need to ensure Xuewei's safe.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.560
Muyu,

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.190
in the Tang Clan's eyes,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.800
is Blood River

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.250
nothing but profit-driven?

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.530
If they choose to meet us,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.530
does that mean

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.980
they think we can ally with?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.010
Then do you think

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.420
Blood River is profit-driven?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.180
Sure.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.980
Shameless, even.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.650
But what counts as "profit"

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.820
and how to seek it...

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.530
everyone's standard

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.180
is different.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.700
Right, Master Mu?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.580
Me?

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.490
Sir,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.610
why bring me up all of a sudden?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.130
Don't worry.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.730
I don't suspect you.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.940
I've been

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.250
watching you play mahjong lately.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.740
You could've won early,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.650
yet you didn't.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.730
Because there was bigger gain ahead.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.850
And...

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.060
I've never feared waiting.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.180
Night Crow,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.420
don't keep making the same mistake.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.770
The dead are gone.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.460
That wasn't a mistake!

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.650
How many times have I said it:

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.650
I'm doing this to benefit the world!

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.850
You still think I'm blindly clinging

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.520
to reviving my dead husband?

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.580
No.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.490
I've found something

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.610
far more interesting.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.220
Something makes the living

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.580
unharmed by blades

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.650
and the dead rise as before.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.700
The drugged puppet art

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.850
is far more interesting

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.530
than those blasted blades and love!

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.610
Your obsession has turned you insane!

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.610
Senior,

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.010
how about a deal?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.700
We join forces

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.850
and turn this miss

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.250
from a poisonous person

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.980
back into a normal person.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.530
And...

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.130
I'll tell you

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.890
how I forge the living

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.460
into drugged puppets.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.610
After that,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.130
you can study yourself

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.770
how to undo my drugged puppet art.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.530
Given that you're brilliant,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.460
you'll crack it one day!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.100
As for me,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.610
I won't stand still.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.850
I do want to be normal.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.610
But if you use this

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.420
to do filthy things,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.890
I won't mind using my last strength

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.340
and every poison in me

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.340
to die together with you.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.180
Hasn't Blood River

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.340
done enough filthy deeds?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.010
In this world,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.100
why care so much

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.890
about right and wrong?

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.180
Besides,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.010
you don't get to decide.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.420
Senior,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.300
it's your call.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.650
If you obtain

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.770
my improved drugged puppet art,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.700
perhaps

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.580
you will stop me sooner.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.820
Don't you

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.580
want that?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.530
You know as well as I do,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.220
given time,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.100
I can surely

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.850
remove the poison from this girl.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.130
As for how...

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.650
Senior,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.940
your help would be

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.420
nothing more

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.100
than saving her life.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.500
[Library]

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.180
So you're General Dian.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.250
Never thought

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.610
I'd meet you

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.010
here of all places.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.650
Indeed.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.620
[Grand Master Tang of Tang Clan]

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.530
A man who shouldn't be in Tianqi

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.980
appearing in this city

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.770
would strike anyone as odd.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.180
Grand Master Tang,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.340
the First Prince

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.610
has been waiting.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.100
This way, please.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.220
Very well.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.650
This is the Tianqi Library.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.820
Open flames are forbidden.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.100
Your Highness,

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.300
aren't you worried about a fire?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.620
I am the First Prince of Beili.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.620
Wherever I stand

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.180
must be full of light,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.380
seen at a glance.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.900
Grand Master Tang.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.860
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.180
I've long heard

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.900
you're quite interesting.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.570
Meeting you today,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.530
it proves true.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.420
Your Highness

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.900
dragged me here from the Tang Clan,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.140
surely not

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.380
just for "interesting", right?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.220
I want

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.860
an alliance with the Tang Clan.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.770
Many want alliance with us.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.180
But the Tang Clan

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.570
already has a Xuanwu Guardian,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.980
a friend to the Prince of Langya.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.420
Prince of Langya

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.290
never meddles in factional strife.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.090
The Prince of Langya?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.530
He's from the last generation.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.810
Back then,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.620
Lei Fortress and the Tang Clan

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.420
made the right choice.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.980
They backed the Prince of Langya and my father,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.730
and won in the end.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.810
But now,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.180
it's a new era.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.490
You should

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.380
make a new choice.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.940
A new choice?

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.460
To beat Lei Fortress for good,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.220
or rather,

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.900
make Lei Fortress

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.090
vanish from the world.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.180
Dangling Lei Fortress's destruction

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.570
to tempt the Tang Clan

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.570
is quite the offer.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.050
But...

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.770
why should I choose you,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.980
Your Highness?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.700
What do you mean?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.490
We're allied with Xueyue City.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.530
If we ally with you too,

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.490
it'll surely clash

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.810
with Xueyue City's plans

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.900
and run against them.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.010
You know,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.900
crossing Baili Dongjun

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.420
isn't easy.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.940
In short,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.090
you're talking terms.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.810
Guards!

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.530
Wait.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.250
Your Highness,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.660
you haven't understood me.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.570
What I mean is:

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.940
just no.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.730
Why not?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.810
Because today,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.180
the moment I saw you,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.860
I was disappointed.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.460
Disappointed?

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.460
Disappointed.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.250
Years ago,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.010
when the Prince of Langya

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.860
took Tang Lianyue from the Tang Clan,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.220
I was delighted.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.770
Though

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.940
I don't like Xiao Ruofeng,

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.660
he's truly exceptional.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.050
He won't take what he could claim,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.090
always yielding and yielding,

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.490
even...

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.980
the throne itself.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.490
When Lianyue left with the Prince of Langya,

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.810
I truly thought

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.140
they'd win renown across the land.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.770
And indeed,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.330
my judgment was right.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.330
However,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.620
today,

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.460
seeing you,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.180
I don't see

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.490
that promise in you.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.660
Xiang,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.810
let's go.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.620
Very well.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.380
Fine.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.940
Grand Master Tang,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.570
it's fine if you don't choose me.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.180
Because I'm not

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.250
choosing you either.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.420
You're too old.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.730
When a man's too old,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.660
his eyes blur.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.860
When vision blurs,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.090
he makes the wrong choice.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.290
What do you mean?

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.770
The Tang Clan today

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.900
is about to change hands.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.980
And you, Grand Master Tang...

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.730
you will

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.730
die here.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.530
Grand Master!

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.810
It's fine.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.050
Setting a trap for me, huh?

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.810
I can't tell if you're foolish

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.220
or just plain foolish!

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.620
You think because this is Tianqi City,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.090
with so many people,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.290
you can kill me?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.380
Xiang,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:58.940
this idea of theirs

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.570
is foolish, isn't it?

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.810
Far too foolish.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.770
Since it's foolish,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.330
they'll pay the price.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.010
Even the Tang Clan

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.860
can't afford the crime

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.510
of killing a prince, can it?

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.380
We can't afford it?

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.490
Even if the juniors can't,

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.090
Grand Master Tang will weigh it himself!

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.860
Well said.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.290
Grand Master Tang,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.860
you're seriously underestimating

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.730
Tianqi City.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.220
Outside,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.220
there's an entire army encircling us.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.220
Unless...

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.380
you can kill

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.620
everyone here tonight,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.980
otherwise,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.810
the whole Tianqi will hunt you down.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.770
Looks like...

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.420
tonight, you're set

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.940
on a fight to the bitter end.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.090
Grand Master,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.140
we shouldn't keep fighting.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.530
Find a chance and break out.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.810
Since they want to die,

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.220
I'll let them die.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.530
Furious Sword Deity

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.140
Yan Zhantian.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.010
Grand Master Tang,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.860
it's been a long time.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.980
You fiend,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.570
why are you in Tianqi City?

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.380
Surely not

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.460
for those useless fools!

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.330
What,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.770
you want a fight?

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.660
But I don't fight. I just kill.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.290
You all...

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.570
are you ready?

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.570
Furious Sword Deity,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.140
why have you come

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.330
to Tianqi City?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.090
None of your business!

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:06.980
Grand Master Tang,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:08.730
let's go.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.220
Are we on the same side?

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.900
Perhaps...

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.570
my disciple is, at least.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.250
Since when did you have a disciple?

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.620
Why are there

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.220
so many questions in this world?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.860
And must every question

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.700
have an answer?

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.530
Move.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.540
[Xiao Chong, Second Prince of Beili]

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.570
They're here.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.660
Much obliged, Grandmaster.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.090
This is the Second Prince, Xiao Chong.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.380
Seems I'm easy to recognize.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.700
The Second Prince, Xiao Chong,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.250
was harmed as a child

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.490
and lost his sight.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.180
That's hardly a secret

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.620
in Tianqi City, is it?

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.730
Correct.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.140
I am Xiao Chong.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.700
Greetings, Grand Master Tang.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.010
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.770
On hearing you're here in Tianqi,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.860
we should've

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.490
prepared more properly

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.250
before inviting you to the residence.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.620
But tonight's events

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.090
happened too suddenly,

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.090
so I troubled the Grandmaster

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.090
to arrange this brief meeting here.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.530
Please don't take offense.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.700
Quite an unusual prince.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.220
But...

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.700
this humility,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.090
and this easy manner

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.420
is a bit deliberate, isn't it?

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.050
Besides me,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.140
Registrar Jin Yu

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.700
is also his master.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.940
He learned my swordplay

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.330
but Jin Yu's temper.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.140
So in swordplay,

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.220
he hasn't improved at all.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.490
That's because I lack talent

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.420
in the sword.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.730
Still, you are remarkable.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.660
You and the Prince of Langya

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.770
are nothing alike.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.770
However,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.730
I can see in you

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.530
something intriguing.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.460
[Dengjin Tower]
This way, please.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.570
I've been to this restaurant often.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.220
This way, please.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.180
The ways of the world are curious.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.290
Days ago, Tang disciples

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.460
were out for my blood.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.460
Today, they host me here.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.810
So what?

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.180
Back when the Demonic Sect marched east,

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.460
no one imagined

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.050
Blood River would aid the defense.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.810
Sometimes, enemies and friends

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.620
are a single thought apart.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.090
Can those bound by profit

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.160
still be called friends?

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.010
I'm Tang Lingzun

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.050
of the Tang Clan.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.620
You must be

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.220
the Patriarch.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.140
I only glimpsed Master Su

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.050
in passing last time.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.530
Back then,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.810
you were the Umbrella Ghost

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.140
sent to kill Liu Yilong.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.700
Years later,

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.490
you're still this handsome.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.050
Madam,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.420
are you married?

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.290
No.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.490
Understood.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.290
Understood what, Sir?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:47.900
Nothing.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.990
How did you know

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.250
I'm in Jin City too?

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.620
Everyone knows

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.100
Blood River's Patriarch

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.290
and the Su family head

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.330
are inseparable,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.490
always together.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.490
He wouldn't come alone.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.860
Alone?

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.730
Our Mu family head

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.490
came as well,

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.730
nearly died at your hands,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.660
still not fully recovered.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.530
Otherwise,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.460
he'd be here today for an answer.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.180
Just a misunderstanding.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.900
Now,

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.380
let's talk business.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.420
Business?

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.460
Madam, you do get straight to the point.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.050
Where is Tang Linghuang?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.090
Master Su,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.620
you're just as direct as I am.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.730
Because this is an answer

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.980
we must have.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.180
I really can't tell you

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.940
where Tang Linghuang is.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.350
But I can tell you this:

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.290
he won't appear again.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.050
In the Tang Clan, only I am qualified

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.330
to negotiate with you.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.570
You?

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.810
Of course.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.700
Fine.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.220
As for me,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.010
I'll talk to anyone

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.420
so long as we get

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.290
what we want.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.490
What can you offer us, Madam?

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.940
Muyu,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.980
since it's a negotiation,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.860
let's show Blood River's good faith.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.460
Go settle the bill

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.490
for this banquet.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.730
Today,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.810
Blood River treats the Madam.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.010
All right.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.250
The Su family head himself

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.770
goes to pay the bill?

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.620
Only a handful of us

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.420
came to Jin City.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.530
We're here to make an alliance,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.810
not pick a fight.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.290
Why isn't the Spider Woman here?

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.460
Yumo isn't the family head.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.460
She came for other business.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.050
Don't mind it.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.050
Other business?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.830
Blood River does seem

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.810
quite interested in Jin City.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.770
We're interested in plenty.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.330
For instance,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.490
our family.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.290
By "family",

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.700
do you mean her?

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.490
I mean her safe and sound.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.940
What counts as "safe and sound"?

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.250
Are you not afraid to die?

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.940
Blood River's "Poisonous Blossom"

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.530
used to kill with a single touch.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.140
But now,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.250
she's just an ordinary lady.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.620
If such a person

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.570
still counts

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.770
as your family, Sir?

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.420
You stripped the poison from Xuewei?

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.010
Is that

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.490
still "safe and sound"?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.940
Whatever you did,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.010
now that she's

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.770
in front of me,

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.940
you can't lay a hand on her again.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.220
The Blood River Patriarch

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.490
is so loyal and true?

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.700
That doesn't match my intel.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.220
And what does your intel say?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.900
Anything in there

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.730
about my looks?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.380
Like...

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.660
handsome with a roguish edge,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.010
and a touch

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.420
of uncommon charm?

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.330
The Blood River Patriarch,

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.380
Su Changhe,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.140
codename Undertaker,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.180
is a profit-driven man

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.820
with sentiment, no ethics,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.380
and a cruel hand.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.770
Not a bad summary.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.810
Yet it seems

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.700
you do know sentiment and ethics.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.320
Everyone in Blood River

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.350
wears a mask.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.980
Under the mask is the true self.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.010
Believe it or not,

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.490
I'm actually

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.290
a loyal, stand-up man.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.490
Sir,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.050
you are interesting.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.530
Pity, though...

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.180
Pity what?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.530
You're not as good-looking as Master Su.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.990
That tongue's pure poison!

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.460
Naturally.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.240
I'm the Tang Clan's Inner Hall Chief,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.660
the most poisonous one of all.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.730
Since you've seen

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.700
your "family",

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.050
as for our business...

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.460
Sir...

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.460
I...

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.490
Rest up for now.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.980
I'll speak for you.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.690
We can talk.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.260
Go on.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.010
Master Su isn't back yet.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.420
Shouldn't we

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.940
discuss this with him too?

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.170
With me here,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.690
he needn't say much.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.090
We've always thought

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.940
the same way,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.570
always have.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.420
Something's off.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.650
What's off?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.780
I hear Master Su

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.610
and Mu Xuewei go way back.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.940
The "Poisonous Blossom" is right here,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.980
yet he left first.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.130
Everything about this seems off.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.090
He probably figured

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.570
the food here wasn't to his taste,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.980
so he went to find lighter dishes.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.010
In Jin City,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.260
where can you find light dishes?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.820
Perhaps

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.610
the Tang Clan?
