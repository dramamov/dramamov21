It's just my parents
haven't given up on that.

You go.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.540
I don't have time for that.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.770
Just 10 minutes, okay?

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.320
I don't even know how to play.

Bro, listen!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.030
I'll tell you the truth.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.200
I got robbed at the arcade

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.150

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.390
Just come in with me and back me up, man.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.750
How am I supposed to back you up?

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.080
Your dad's a police officer.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.240
I can't help you with that.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.570
Ask my dad to back you up.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.630
No, bro.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.320

until the college entrance exam?

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.550
Do you know how many days are left

Why are you asking me for help with this?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.870
I'm just a nurse,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.870
not a doctor.

there's a national conference,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.250
have to attend.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.670
It must be because of Xiaolong's case.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.790
They don't want
to get involved with that trouble.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.720
Please help me out.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.320
It's just for intimidation.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.000
That guy

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.630
definitely isn't mentally ill.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.890
When I questioned him,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.630
he was yelling,
but he kept covering his eyes

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.630
and peeking at me.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.490
He's definitely faking it.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.320
Fine.

But let's be clear,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.600
you need to help me too.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.960
Okay.

Help me
process my application to go abroad.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.960
I'm going to the U.S.

Here's the hydrogen peroxide
you asked for.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.200
Thank you!

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.510
I'll buy you a soda tomorrow, okay?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:25.960
Sure.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.560
What's the hydrogen peroxide for?

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.750
This morning,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.670
Dalong asked me

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.320
to get some from the hospital.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.250
Dalong? Crazy Wu's older brother?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.120
Why does he need hydrogen peroxide?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.550
When his wife is on her period,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.480
she'll leave that thing, you know?

clean that thing

Blood stains.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.800
It works especially well on blood.

Something's off.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:58.960

to tell me to record details.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.250

We'll take whatever they give us.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.270
You should talk to Dalong,

tell him to stop stacking bricks all day.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.720
The space he's walling up

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.780
might not count in the compensation.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.120
Okay.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.960
But actually,

It really is conserved.

What happened to you?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.120
I was right.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.750
Where does it hurt?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.010
There's so much blood!

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.240
It really is conserved.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.920
I'm asking you!

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.980
Where does it hurt?

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.000
Wang Tianxin's ignoring me.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.380

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.400
Who's Wang Tianxin?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.000
His girlfriend.

Ex-girlfriend.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.480
What happened then?

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.920
Later I ran outside

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.270
and checked several hutongs,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.000
but I didn't see

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.270
any blood traces anywhere.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.130
I was confused,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.610
so I quickly cleaned up

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.550
my little brother

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.270
and sent him back
to Anding Hospital that same night.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.000
This time, we climbed over

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.330
the back wall to get in.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.920
Why didn't you call the police then?

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.110
Since childhood,

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.680
my dad always said

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.200
that he gave me all the good things.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.600
After my brother went crazy,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.540
I somewhat felt responsible.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.790
My dad told me to take good care of him.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.590
I owe him.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.240
Ran.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.790
How's my brother?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.790
They're questioning him now.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.030
Uncle Ran and my dad

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.270
are old friends.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.080
Please look out for him.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.440
What now, bro?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.290
Have you made up your mind?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.240
I've been thinking about it.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.810
Well, tell us about it.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.750
All molecules and particles...

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.320
are constantly colliding,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.920
expanding, colliding,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.270
and expanding again.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.720
At this very moment,

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.070
those molecules and particles condensed,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.920
and became what we are now.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.780
That's how we end up sitting here.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.410
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.550
Don't think

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.400
you can fake your way out

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.640
by pretending to be crazy.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.750
I'm not crazy!

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.640
Good.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.060
You're honest.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.880
Let's talk then.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.490
On the night of the 18th,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.720
who did you run into?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.880
Do you remember

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.920
who you ran into that night?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.450
Let's just say it's a woman.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.680
Why?

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.240
What's the difference
between a woman and a tree?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.790
Then how did you

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.790
get all that blood on you that night?

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.510
Can a tree bleed?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.070
I stepped on her.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.640
You stepped on her body?

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.510
I stepped on her head.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.560
Then she started bleeding.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.160
And then...

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.070
and then she became small.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.270
Then I jumped up,

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.000
ate a big mushroom,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.030
and I became really,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440
really tall.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.960
That's right.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.440
In the end, she went to the castle,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.550
raised a little flag,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.960
and fired a salute for that.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.760
Right, right!

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.600
He's absolutely crazy.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.400
There's nothing we can do.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.830
Jian was just faking mental illness.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.360
But this guy is really sick.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.800
Everything he says is just total nonsense.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.550
Ran,

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.640
isn't this Crazy Wu...

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.680
from your precinct?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.080
You should know him well.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.520
This kid used to be really smart.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.110
Later when he was a teenager,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.830
he started dating a girl from his class.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.750
Their parents and the school

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.920
were totally against it.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.510
They supervised them constantly.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.590
But the more they opposed them,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.440
the more intense their love got.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.310
Later, they planned to elope together.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.110
They agreed

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.760
to meet and leave that night.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.480
But somehow,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.310
the girl

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.110
fell into a ditch,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.530
and died instantly.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.510
The boy searched for her all night,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.510
and only found her the next morning.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.050
The girl's body was covered with ants.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.680
Since then,

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.070
this kid went completely crazy.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.960
He spends all his time raising ants.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.830
He always feels like

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.160
the ants can talk to him.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.780
How about this?

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.200
Ran knows him better.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.720
Ran,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.040
you should interrogate him.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.890
I can coax him

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.520
back to the Anding Hospital.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.010
But to interrogate him?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.790
I don't think I can manage that.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.590
Excessive modesty

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.850
is just a sign of pride.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.770
I'll give it a try then.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.720
Why are you sitting here?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.750
You want me to interrogate him alone?

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.440
No, Mentor!

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.010
You don't need to go in.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.440
The room is small,
and it gets hot with too many people.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.920
It's cooler for you to stay here.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.270
I...

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.880
It's too hot.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.510
Drink more water.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.850
It was raining heavily that night.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.550
Did you run away

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.810
from Anding Hospital?

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.680
Did you go home?

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.110
Yes, Ran.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.050
I didn't bring any ants.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.510
I've said before.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.880
It's all a sign!

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.310
Nobody listens.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.920
Leaving me here
to hold everything together.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.070
If I'm finished,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.350
this whole hutong will be finished!

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.960
No matter what,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.920
I can't live without ants.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.880
That night,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.460
did you run into Liu Ke?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.230
This girl right here.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.070
She's pretty.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.900
Where did you meet her?

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.960
Right next to my house.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.940
What was she doing?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
She was dancing.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.030
Dancing?

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.130
What kind of dance?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.700
Ballroom dancing.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.180
Just spinning around.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.790
Ballroom dancing

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.400
usually takes two people, right?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.790
Yes, two people.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.340
I'm not talking about you.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.270
I'm talking about that girl.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.830
Dancing.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.780
I was holding her while we danced.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.970
Did she want to?

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.930
Did she resist?

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.980
Yes, she wanted to.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.200
She even laughed.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.610
You asked her to dance,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.930
and she agreed?

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:27.790
Yes.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.720
I went up and asked

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.690
if she wanted to dance with me.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.060
She didn't refuse,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.400
so we danced.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.880
Just dancing?

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.310
Nothing else?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.510
I wanted to do something.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.240
Do what?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.160
I said,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.550
"Let's recite a poem together."

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.360
Read Gu Cheng's poem.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.510
Gu Cheng?

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.770
From which dynasty?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.030
"If you come with me,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.000
you'll count my footsteps.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.110
If I go with you,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.480
I can only see your back."

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.960
"If you come with me,

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.160
you'll count my footsteps.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.200
If I go with you,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.310
I can only see your back."

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.030
What was

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.140
the girl's reaction then?

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.830
She didn't talk to me.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.110
So I got angry.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.680
I got angry

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.810
and threw her aside!

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.550
What are you doing?

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.550
Hey... calm down.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.110
She must've thought I was crazy,

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.910
that's why she didn't talk to me.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.510
Take it easy, just take your time.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.640
Then what happened?

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.480
I remember now.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.720
I heard her say...

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.550
What? Xiaolong, speak louder.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.160
Louder.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.640
"As long as the lightning strikes,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.110
there will be a dancing flame!"

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.310
What the heck?

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.480
"Man can be as humble as an ant,
yet as beautiful as a God."

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.450
That's Gu Cheng's poem, right?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.350
Xiaolong.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.790
We're trying to help you.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.790
You need to tell us truthfully

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.440
what you did

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.480
and what you saw.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.460
What did you actually do to that girl?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.350
She didn't talk to me,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.000
so I got upset,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.110
and threw her

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.440
into the well nearby.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.400
What else did you do?

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.720
My ants are calling me.

And didn't they say

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.690
he had some emotional trauma?

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720

Yes.

The timing, place,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.400

No doubt about it.

When interacting with young women,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.000
he was totally normal,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.550
and he's very polite, actually.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.640
He's definitely not the kind of person

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.040
who would assault girls.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.000
You recited a poem with him once

That's not relevant.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.420

Whether I believe it or not
doesn't matter.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.340
What matters is the evidence.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.810
If it really was someone
from the hutong,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.590
then why

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.120
didn't they do it years ago?

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.030

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.840
and we are different from you.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.800
You flash your butt

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.200
at young girls every day,

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.480
and still expect a home and career?

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.650
I'll tell you this.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.800
Back in my hometown,

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.470
I had it all— a wife, a kid,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.400
everything.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.670
A state-owned enterprise job.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.070
Dual-income household.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.360
If life was so good,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.280
then why did you run off

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.610
to be a trash scavenger?

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.690
Money can't buy happiness, right?

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.070
At home,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.400
working,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.030
doing chores,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.640
watching the kid every night...

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.660
it looked fine on the surface,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.280
but night after night,

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.760
I just couldn't sleep.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.920
It drove me crazy.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320
Why?

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.710
Because I wanted to lose my mind and die!

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.630
Now, I'm living my best life.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.070
I can wear whatever I want,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.030
I can go naked if I want to.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.840
I'm so free.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.030
Fun, isn't it?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.760
Actually, only those

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.420
people with homes and careers

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.430
will do the most disgusting things.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.150
They just hide it well.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.710
You can't see

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.740
the filth inside them.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.940
So, arresting you was a mistake then?

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.630
You're giving us a lecture now?

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.840
I don't care.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.670
It's all the same

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.160
where I eat or sleep.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.640
But with your method?

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.680
You'll never catch anyone.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.000
Don't talk about us.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.200
Talk about yourself.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.510
Tell us the truth.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.710
Dong,

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.230
why are you up so early?

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.480
You... you...

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.190
Why are you pouring cold water
on yourself this early?

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.190
To wake myself up,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.410
so I can start memorizing vocabulary.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.280
You...

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.030
Don't catch a cold.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.190
Unbelievable.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.400
Dong.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.190
You need to eat breakfast.
Don't go to school on an empty stomach.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.920
I'm not eating, Mom.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.520
Come here.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.360
I have enough money.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.030
Nonsense.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.800
Just take it.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.710
Off you go.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:01.800
I'm leaving.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.400
Don't rush.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.670
Dong.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800
Goodbye, Mr. Guo.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.280
Dong.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:26.760
I'm sorry.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.000
I still want to focus on my studies.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.110
I can't afford to fail another year.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.230
We found two of them under the bridge.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.490
You really found them?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.360
They were indeed playing mahjong.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.510
We haven't found the third one yet.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.630
We have them confirmed the photos.
It's definitely Jian.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.710
Then we have to release him.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.770
We can't let him go.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.150
He took off his pants

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.960
and flashed young girls.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.400
What kind of person does that?

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.590
Besides,

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.030
we found a bunch of high heels

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.920
and stockings at his place.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.360
The owners already reported the theft.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.620
It took a lot of effort.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.910
Then put him in administrative detention.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:25.710
Sign here.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.560
First time making an arrest?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.360
Why did you say

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.660
we won't catch anyone?

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.500
Every household has secrets.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.510
Just lift the roof,

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.970
and you'll see.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.330
Just take a look.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.330
It's much more exciting than what's on TV.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:16.850
Beiping.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.150
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.550
It's fine.
