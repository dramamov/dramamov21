[DEAD END]

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.310
[Episode 2]

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.400
Go back

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.930
to whatever you were doing.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.729
We're handling a case here.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830
Don't stand around watching,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.560
okay?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.430
Move along!

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.400
Stop watching.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.729
You'd know by now
if we could talk about it.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.630
Excuse me.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.729
What took you so long, CPPSC grad?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.680
I was out checking for people
without temporary residence permits.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Step back!

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.000
Is this a murder case?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.229
None of your business.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.350
Hurry up. Help keep order!

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.920
Move along!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.380
Come on.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.560
Everyone, step back!

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.350
Step back!

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.680
Step back! Stop pushing.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.120
Step back, okay?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.790
Step back!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.250
Auntie.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.560
Don't push.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.710
-Back off!
-Back off!

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.960
Don't gather here.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.780
Are you hot?

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.380
Get up!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.150
Step aside!

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.960
Excuse me.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.870
Come on.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.840
Stop watching!

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.910
Go back!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.630
Go home.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.240
Go home.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.040
Put it inside.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.240
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.630
Hurry up.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.400
Go home.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.190
Don't join the crowd here.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.450
Block off the outside!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.120
Go!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.520
Ran,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.960
did that old lady say anything?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.680
I asked her all night—

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.540
still the same.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.910
She said she didn't see the suspect,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.840
only the body.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.840
It even gave her a heart attack.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.470
Yes.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:44.610
Make way!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.750
Make way!

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.840
Make way! Make way!

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.360
Stop pushing.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.280
We're working a case—no entry.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.910
We're from the Criminal Police Team.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.280
We're one of you.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.870
Song!

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.150
He's inside.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.190
Stop asking, okay?

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.610
Chief.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.150
We'd tell you if we could.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.680
Have you identified her?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.680
She's in the water;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680
we can't tell her.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.630
I think

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.030
we should get the body out first.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030
There are more and more people here.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.030
Is there any trace at the scene?

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.830
It's pouring;

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.520
the rain's washed any traces away.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.580
Pump the water out.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.870
Do it.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.870
Stop pushing.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.079
What are you pushing for?

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.810
Go home and wash the water tank.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.680
The body has been stewing in the well

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.340
long enough to turn into soup.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.079
Go home.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:44.810
My goodness.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.290
Why did you go in again?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.470
I want to go in and take a look.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.560
There are so many people inside.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.690
Don't make it worse.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
Stay outside.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.120
Hello,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.720
show me your ID.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.920
Did you see

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.120
anyone suspicious

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.750
on the night of May 18th?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.310
Think about it.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.310
Aunt, if there's nothing else,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.040
-Don't look here.
-That night,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.040
I slept better than any other night.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.480
I didn't hear anything.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.310
Did you see anyone suspicious?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.160
I was home sleeping.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.190
Just tell me.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.330
I went to bed early.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.190
Excuse me.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.480
Captain Song!

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.800
How's it going?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.159
The victim's father, Liu Aijun,

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.040
fired a few people

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.310
when the factory restructured.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.680
Those guys are suspects.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.010
We're looking for them.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.920
Did he see the victim

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.680
last night?

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.600
No.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.360
I heard he's the stepfather, right?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.120
Yes.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.750
How's their relationship?

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.240
They've always been close.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.560
I checked and he's basically cleared.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.240
And last night

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.159
he was working late at the factory

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.000
with his secretary.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.480
Have the meeting first.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.140
Secretary?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.040
His female secretary.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.170
They've been together for half a year.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680
She provided an alibi too.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.540
Is this female secretary single?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.480
Yes.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.560
Liu,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.310
Zhang,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.360
you two go over this thoroughly.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.090
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.690
Here's what I think:

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.430
let's use

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.270
our local know-how;

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.750
check whether anyone unfamiliar

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.240
has shown up in the precinct recently.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.900
Generally,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.950
when a newcomer shows up around here,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.920
we patrol officers

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.380
figure it out pretty fast.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.330
Who's the cop in this precinct?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.560
Ran.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.920
Ran Xi?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.560
Ran Xi!

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.560
I didn't recognize you.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.070
Well...

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.400
Look how many years it's been
since we last met.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.120
Back then,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.040
I was Little Song, he was Little Ran.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.360
We've known for many years,
and we're now getting old.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.620
You're in this office.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.270
Hello, Captain Song.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.750
Ran,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.310
you are a veteran detective,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.870
right?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.310
Share your thoughts with everyone.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.800
I fully support
the Criminal Police Team's work.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.930
I'm asking you to share your thoughts.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.390
Guess I'm just unlucky—

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.050
—had to happen in my precinct.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.840
What are you talking about?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.430
I mean, the girl is unlucky.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.040
Ran is testing us.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.270
In my opinion,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.510
the suspect probably meant to rape her,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.240
but got angry

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.630
when she resisted.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.390
In the end,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.850
he threw her into the well.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.590
She must've fought back,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.740
otherwise she wouldn't have been killed.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.040
No.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.640
I don't think it was rape.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.630
If it were,
he wouldn't have been so violent.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.480
And her wallet

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.280
wasn't taken,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.240
so we can rule out robbery.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.950
Either it's a crime of passion

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.000
or a revenge killing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.190
Start investigating along those two lines.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.680
Okay.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.050
What did her mother say?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.480
Her mother is Huang Hui,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.270
the union chair

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.909
at the electronics factory.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.000
She's a bit difficult to deal with.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.720
What do you mean?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.070
She refuses to acknowledge the body,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.560
and won't let anyone else either.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.270
Then how was the identity confirmed?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.930
Name was on her school papers.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.560
It's a bit troublesome

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.510
if the family doesn't identify the body.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.000
Yes.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.390
Ran!

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.280
Think of a way.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.240
Chief Zhu,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.480
Tian Hao and Mei showed up,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.410
insisting their daughter is dead.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.160
It happened in my precinct.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160
I'll go handle it.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.130
Will you keep your promise?

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.120
is the body our Chang?

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.750
I saw the body.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.500
She had that long hair.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.280
You really think it's your Tian Chang?

Wait, Ran,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.480
is it true?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.270
Why would I lie to you?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.080
Ran said so.

You...

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.670

Thank you.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.820
She died a pretty horrible death.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.410
Judging from the wound,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.360
it looks like one clean slash
across the neck,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.550
cut through the windpipe

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.350

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.390
she choked to death on her own blood.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.390
She couldn't even scream by then.

The strangest part is, there was no semen.

The genital area

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.400

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.080
we couldn't find any.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.070
How about this?

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:30.910
Come with me

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.370
back to the station and sign the papers.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.570
Where are you going?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.760
Where are you going so late?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.510
He will come with us
to the police station.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.600
Why are you going?

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.650

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.290
-Who do you think you are?
-Stop beating him.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.290

Who allows you to go?

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:56.910
Aijun,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.240
let's talk about this later.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.910
How could your wife

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.240
hit a cop?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.670
Well,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.120
the station still needs...

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.030
What?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.270
Calm down!

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.150
Who gave you the right to go?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.480
Are you her real father?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.790
Who are you?

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.240
Who gave you the right to go?

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.560
Who told you to go?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.480
I'll kill you if you dare!

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.240
I'll kill you and
that slut of a secretary of yours!

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.750
He's been beaten up like that.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.150
We have to go check on him.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.200
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.150
You just rush in when something happens.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.360
A couple's arguing

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.630
and you go sticking your nose in.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.440
That iron's just as likely

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.080
to smash your face

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.280
as it is to smash mine.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.580
Actually, I...

Oh no.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.220
Actually what?

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.110
About this matter...

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.970
What are you trying to say?

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.030
You're really dawdling.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.630
You're not making any sense.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.450
What happened?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.310
What is it?

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.680
What do you mean by "What?"

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.030
Didn't we agree to
look at the place together?

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.230
I've been waiting for you for two hours.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.440
Today?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.710
Didn't we agree on tomorrow?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.320
Are you playing dumb with me?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.550
Are you moving or not?

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720
Just tell me.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.070
Give me some time.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.950
There's a case in the hutong.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.510
What does it have to do

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.440
with our moving?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.240
A girl

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.240
was killed

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.440
and thrown in a well.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.010
Then...

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.350
That's more reason to move.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.410
Move immediately!

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.640
When something serious happens,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.590
if I, a patrol officer,

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.270
move out first,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.510
what will others think?

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.510
So if you don't solve the case,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.840
I'm not allowed to move?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.030
Anyway, I can't stop

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.090

Do you want to listen with me?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.920
No, no.

You go ahead and listen.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.210
I won't either.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.460

If you need to reach me,

the Nanhuaishu Police Station.

I don't really like phone calls;

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.680
they're

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.540
too short, and nothing lasts.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.920
I like writing letters.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.270
How about this: let's make a deal.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.850

I'll write you a letter.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.660
By then, I'll probably be far,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.550
Ran,

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.110
I'll tell you just two things.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.650
First,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.270
in all your ten years at the station,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.680
you've always played the fool.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.750
You've dodged every major case,

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.960
and have I ever said a word about it?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.450
Second,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.200
think back to

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.720
when you were his age.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.750
What were you like?

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.610
And how did your mentor treat you?

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.170
Is being a mentor

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.550
that easy?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.440
[advanced unit]

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:36.690
We're just here to get the facts.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.440
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.270
How did you

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.640
get to know Liu Ke?

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.840
I interrogated her father—

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.230
her biological father, Zhou Weiping.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.580
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.210
Then I got in touch with her.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960
Zhou Weiping...

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.880
Did you inform her

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.920
that the suspect was detained?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.920
Did you serve the detention notice?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160
I didn't tell her.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.240
Then why did you call her?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.200
I want the suspect

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.770
to cooperate with our work.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.270
I promised him

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.640
I'd deliver a postcard to his daughter.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.510
What postcard?

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.880
A postcard of The Little Tigers.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.080
What did she give you?

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.960
What are you implying?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.750
You ask the suspect's daughter

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.680
to meet you late at night.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.610
What do you mean?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.420
You were asking for
something, weren't you?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.110
Yes.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.190
I was asking for her life.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.640
We are classmates,

You're still young.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.720

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.200

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.750
This is my first case.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.270
This is also my first case.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.530
I don't need your help.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.270
Come on, let's go through this.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:50.570
You said you went out to meet her

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.240
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.720
just to give her a postcard.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720
But now you're telling me

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.790
you two didn't even know
each other before?

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.680
Buddy, if our roles were reversed,

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.720
would you even believe that?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.750
Believe it or not.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.590
With an attitude like yours,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.350
you'll never make it into
the Criminal Police Team.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.210
Say that again.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.590
I said you'll never make it into

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.790
the Criminal Police Team.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.720
And you'll never solve a real case!

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.400
Whoa, what's going on with you two?

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.000
Did you both wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.590
Do you still think

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.650
you're in college?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.680
You're still on this?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.680
Someone saw
the two of them together yesterday.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.070
We have a timeline.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.590
Who?

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.070
Zhao was seen with Liu Ke

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.200
around 8-something PM.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.070
Someone saw it.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.550
The witness is giving his statement
right now.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.610
But the victim was killed after 10 PM.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.400
And at 10 o'clock,

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.720
everyone in the station
saw Zhao right here with us!

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.270

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.350
Well,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.720
sign the statement, then.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.790
If the witness can give a clear account,

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.720
why do you even need his statement?

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.640
Let's see which one of us

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.750
puts the cuffs on the suspect first.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.110
See who puts the cuffs
on the suspect first.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.680

before coming here?

better than I do.
