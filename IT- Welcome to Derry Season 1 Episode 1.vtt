Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

00:10.427 --> 00:13.138
Trouble! Trouble!
Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

00:17.267 --> 00:18.351
Trouble!

00:18.435 --> 00:19.769
Mothers of River City,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.896
heed that warning before it's too late.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.315
Watch for the tell-tale signs
of corruption.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.651
The minute your son leaves the house,

00:26.735 --> 00:29.154
does he re-buckle his knickerbockers

00:29.237 --> 00:31.031
below the knee?

00:31.489 --> 00:33.658
Is there a nicotine stain
on his index finger?

00:33.742 --> 00:36.619
A dime-novel hidden in the corncrib?

00:36.703 --> 00:40.707
Is he starting to memorize jokes
from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.334
Are certain words

00:43.418 --> 00:45.170
creeping into his conversation?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.465
Words like--

00:48.548 --> 00:49.632
like "swell"?

00:49.716 --> 00:50.842
Trouble!

00:51.176 --> 00:52.469
And "so's your old man."

00:52.510 --> 00:53.636
Trouble!

00:53.720 --> 00:54.804
If so, my friends

00:54.888 --> 00:56.014
You got trouble

00:56.097 --> 00:57.390
Oh we got trouble

00:57.474 --> 00:58.641
Right here in River City

00:58.725 --> 01:00.393
With a capital T
And that rhymes with P

01:00.477 --> 01:02.479
-And that stands for "pool"
-That stands for "pool"

01:02.562 --> 01:04.522
-We've surely got trouble
-We've surely got trouble

01:04.605 --> 01:06.316
-Right here in River City
-Right here

01:06.399 --> 01:07.525
Remember the Maine

01:07.609 --> 01:09.402
Plymouth Rock
And the Golden Rule

01:09.486 --> 01:11.863
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble--

01:12.530 --> 01:14.199
Kid, get over here.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.533
Kid, get over here. Now.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.578
Get over here. Hey!

01:18.661 --> 01:20.121
Oh, yes we got trouble
Trouble, trouble

01:20.205 --> 01:22.414
Oh yes, we got trouble here
We got big, big trouble

01:22.499 --> 01:24.459
-With a T
-With a capital T...

01:36.221 --> 01:37.764
Cal, what's going on?

01:39.390 --> 01:40.850
It's the Clements boy again, Hank.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.602
Third time this week I've caught him

01:42.685 --> 01:43.978
sneaking in for a freebie.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.233
Leave him be. You ever see
that boy's damn family?

01:50.610 --> 01:53.154
Pity is not gonna keep
the lights on, Hank.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.283
Ronnie.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.372
You see a boy
running around here about your age?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.125
Yeah, Pops.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.627
He went that way.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.179
Come on. Back to work.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.643
Music Man, directed by?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.061
Morton DaCosta.

02:26.728 --> 02:28.022
First film was?

02:28.523 --> 02:29.774
Personal favorite of your nana's.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.569
-Auntie Mame!
-That's my girl.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.322
Hey!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.043
Next time, I'm calling the police!

02:49.543 --> 02:50.879
You hear me, kid?

02:51.838 --> 02:52.964
I mean it!

03:49.646 --> 03:51.022
You all right, young man?

03:51.105 --> 03:54.859
-Yes.
-Look at you, you poor thing.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.279
Get in before you catch
your death of cold.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.490
Thank you.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.960
Wrap yourself in this, dear.
You must be freezing.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.127
Thank you.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.171
Now, you just tell us where home is,

04:15.255 --> 04:18.216
and we'll get you back to your parents
safe and sound, okay?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.388
Anywhere but Derry.

04:26.641 --> 04:30.853
Well, we're headed to Portland,
so you hitched the right ride.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.152
WNXE News Radio.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.779
It's the top of the hour.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.782
Here are tonight's top stories.
Fresh reports tonight

04:42.865 --> 04:45.702
out of Moscow of more
underground nuclear tests.

04:45.784 --> 04:48.079
Experts now warn the resulting radiation

04:48.162 --> 04:50.665
poses a global risk
with potential consequences

04:50.748 --> 04:53.042
ranging from cancer to genetic mutations

04:53.126 --> 04:56.462
resulting in highly
unusual birth defects...

04:56.546 --> 04:58.464
Dad, can we put something else on?

04:59.215 --> 05:00.883
This stuff gives me the willies.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.012
Willies? W-I-L--

05:04.095 --> 05:05.847
Ray, not now.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.018
He's going through a phase.
He spells everything.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.938
-L-I-E-S.
-That's right.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.191
Why don't you show our new friend
what a good little speller you are?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.527
Spell "bungalow."

05:20.194 --> 05:24.866
B-U-N-G-A-L-O-W.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.577
Spell "symphony."

05:28.202 --> 05:32.040
S-Y-M-P-H-O-N-Y.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.876
Spell "fuchsia."

05:34.959 --> 05:38.796
F-U-C-H-S-I-A.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.798
Now, that's a ten-dollar word.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.136
Spell "trouble."

05:45.219 --> 05:48.014
T-R-U...

05:48.681 --> 05:52.143
T-R-O-A...

05:53.186 --> 05:55.271
T-R-U...

05:56.189 --> 05:59.400
T-R-O-U-B-L-E, you idiot!

06:01.277 --> 06:04.280
-Be nice, Arlene.
-I am nice!

06:06.032 --> 06:07.408
When I wanna be.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.536
There goes my little harlot.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.374
Couldn't glue those legs together
if you tried, I tell ya.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.168
Reminds me of her mother.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.599
I thought you said
we were headed to Portland.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.683
Spell "vasectomy," baby.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.520
Can you use that in a sentence?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.271
Your father got a vasectomy

06:37.355 --> 06:39.399
right after he impregnated me again.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.819
V-A-S-E...

06:42.902 --> 06:44.237
Can you pull over, please?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.155
...C-T-O-M-Y.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.326
-Necrosis.
-N-E-C-R-O-S-I-S.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.411
"Kidnapping."

06:51.494 --> 06:52.954
There's a gas station up ahead,

06:53.037 --> 06:54.747
-and I have to pee.
-"Maggots."

06:54.831 --> 06:56.749
If we could just pull over,
even for a second.

06:56.832 --> 06:58.376
-...G-O-T-S.
-"Cadaver."

06:58.459 --> 07:01.838
-C-A-D-A-V-E-R.
-"Strangulation."

07:01.921 --> 07:03.172
No, no! Please, no!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.801
...L-A-T-I-O-N.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.887
-Let me out!
-"Out." O-U-T!

07:09.971 --> 07:13.933
-Let me out!
-O-U-T! O-U-T!

07:14.016 --> 07:15.726
O-U-T!

07:15.810 --> 07:17.228
-O-U-T.
-Let me out!

07:17.311 --> 07:18.563
O-U-T.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.607
O-U-T. O-U-T.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.443
I'll handle the driving, son.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.819
O-U--

07:28.281 --> 07:32.368
-O-U-T.
-O-U-T. O-U-T.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.999
Looks like somebody
else wants to get... O-U-T.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.877
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T! O-U-T!

07:40.960 --> 07:43.838
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

07:43.921 --> 07:46.549
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

07:46.632 --> 07:49.218
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

07:49.302 --> 07:52.054
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

07:52.138 --> 07:54.682
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

07:54.765 --> 07:55.975
O-U-T!

07:56.058 --> 07:57.101
O-U-T!

07:58.936 --> 08:02.648
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T! O-U-T!

08:02.732 --> 08:06.444
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T! O-U-T!

08:06.527 --> 08:08.613
-O-U-T! O-U-T!

08:09.780 --> 08:11.324
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

08:11.407 --> 08:14.035
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

08:14.118 --> 08:16.996
-O-U-T!
-O-U-T!

08:26.088 --> 08:27.465
He's beautiful, dear.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.592
Isn't he, though?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.523
Come here.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.777
Come meet your family, sweetheart.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.406
Look at my baby!

10:37.428 --> 10:38.429
Shit!

10:53.611 --> 10:55.196
Derry, huh?

10:55.279 --> 10:57.323
I bet there's
zero nightclubs in this town.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.492
Probably not one decent
Chinese restaurant.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.411
Come on, Pauly. We survived Korea.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.538
Pretty sure we can survive this.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.873
Yeah, speak for yourself.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.044
Major Hanlon, Captain Russo.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.421
I'm Colonel Fuller, General Shaw's XO.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.131
He asked that I greet
you airmen personally.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.216
How was the flight up?

11:15.299 --> 11:16.759
-Smooth.
-A little bumpy.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.971
Excellent, gentlemen. This way, please.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.353
Your skills and experience
will be put to good use here, Major.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.648
DAFB is one of only six SAC bases
in the entire country.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.484
Now, it might seem somewhat remote,
but make no mistake.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.986
As the northernmost continental
United States Air Force base,

11:36.070 --> 11:37.279
we are the tip of the spear.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.157
Soviet airspace is a brisk
seven-hour flight that way.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.952
Straight over the Arctic Ocean
and on till morning.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.995
In other words, when the nuclear shit

11:45.079 --> 11:47.415
hits the fan, we'll be the first call.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.043
If. If the nuclear shit
hits the fan.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.003
I'm a bit of an optimist.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.464
Yeah, I'm not.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.391
Sir, what's that over there?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.394
That's Special Projects.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.649
Sounds special.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.660
I understand you're only living
on base temporarily, Major.

12:24.869 --> 12:25.953
Yes, sir.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.788
Renting a house in town,
just waiting for everything

12:27.872 --> 12:29.540
to get all set up.
Should be finished by the time

12:29.623 --> 12:30.958
my family gets here.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.752
What, you don't want 'em
to live near Uncle Pauly?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.253
Thought I was family, huh?

12:34.336 --> 12:37.006
Eight years living on base,
I just think my missus is ready

12:37.089 --> 12:39.425
for a little taste of normal.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.635
Well, if normal is what you're after,

12:42.219 --> 12:44.138
you two are going to love Derry.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.857
Hey, Lills, you okay? Jeez, I'm sorry.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.903
It's a bunch of fucking cretins,
that's what they are.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.696
I'm fine.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.449
Guess I'll just stink
like pickle juice until dinner.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.620
Well, if you ask me, you smell delicious.

13:49.703 --> 13:53.207
Bert the Turtle says,
"Duck and Cover!"

13:53.290 --> 13:56.544
So, my aunt said we can come
on any weekend we want this summer.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.212
Swell.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.922
My cousin Ray said
they have a bunch of parties

14:00.005 --> 14:01.757
at the beach that are crazy.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.884
They're supposed to be the ginchiest.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.095
What? What are you looking at?

14:06.470 --> 14:07.680
My eyes?

14:08.472 --> 14:10.724
These new glasses
make them look huge, don't they?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.518
That optometrist is a sadist.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.895
No. No, Marge, your eyes are fine.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.606
-Sincerely.
-You have to promise me,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.358
because I'm not going
through the rest of the year

14:19.441 --> 14:20.901
looking like some bug-eyed freak.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.945
It's hard enough to get
Joey Navinsky to notice me

14:23.028 --> 14:24.780
-as it is.
-I mean, obviously,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.782
we're not alone in the universe, right?

14:28.951 --> 14:29.952
Did--

14:30.744 --> 14:32.621
Did Loony Lilly Bainbridge
just check us out?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.915
-What?
-I don't know. My point is,

14:34.999 --> 14:36.709
what if the atomic age
changed everything

14:36.792 --> 14:39.420
and now we're a threat,
which is why visitors from the red planet

14:39.503 --> 14:42.381
-are already here, secretly?
-In Derry?

14:42.673 --> 14:44.884
Maybe that's what's going on
over that air base.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.802
Maybe they've got one
of these things, like, on ice

14:46.886 --> 14:48.345
that they're experimenting with.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.891
You've been sitting too close
to the TV again, haven't you?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.894
My dad says those cathode rays
will shrink your balls, man.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.439
I saw seven C-133's land there
in less than 48 hours.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.983
Big, fat Cargomasters. Why?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.985
What are they carrying? Think about it.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.820
You didn't study for the test
at all, did you?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.990
What's the point
when World War III is imminent?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.121
Duck and cover, Teds. Duck and cover.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.462
So, to keep you groovy kids grooving,

15:21.629 --> 15:24.048
here's Hasil Adkins
with "Chicken Walk."

15:32.765 --> 15:34.099
These are your men, Major.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.851
Thank you, airman.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.520
Afternoon, airmen.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.314
Fall in!

15:41.315 --> 15:42.316
Masters!

15:43.025 --> 15:44.735
Look alive, men. Major on deck.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.031
Ten-hut!

15:55.579 --> 15:56.956
Major Hanlon, we've been expecting you.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.750
It's an honor, sir.
I'm First Airman O'Donnell.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.920
This is the rest of 70th Squadron's MX.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.757
First Airman Colton, Allard and Donahue,

16:06.840 --> 16:08.175
Staff Sergeant Ricciardi,

16:08.842 --> 16:10.594
and Airman
Second Class Masters, sir.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.226
Airman Masters.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.729
Now, I am your superior
commissioned officer,

16:20.938 --> 16:23.774
so I expect to be accorded
the respect of said rank.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.402
Do I make myself clear?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.947
I'll get you next time, brother.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.907
Do we have a problem here?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.158
Ten-hut!

16:33.951 --> 16:35.452
No, sir, General Shaw.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.037
Remind me, Colonel.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.289
What's the penalty
for a Code 89 violation?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.915
Court martial, sir.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.878
So, I ask you once again,
do we have a problem?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.639
-Walk with me, Major.
-Yes, sir.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.686
I apologize.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.105
Not quite the welcome wagon
we intended.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.525
Why don't you swing by my office tomorrow
around 1500 hours?

17:06.650 --> 17:07.984
Get properly acquainted.

17:08.484 --> 17:09.944
Yes, sir. I'll be there.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.579
Take me back to the Q, airman.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.592
So, you're sucking up already, huh?

17:41.685 --> 17:44.188
Why do they make brassieres so pointy?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.149
I mean, boobs aren't that pointy.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.400
Are we supposed to believe

17:48.484 --> 17:51.070
that under a sweater
is just two pointy cones?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.698
Are pointy cones better?

17:55.616 --> 17:59.411
Teds, Miss Johanssen
is about to take her bra off.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.205
Her boobs are gonna be out.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.331
What are you doing?

18:02.498 --> 18:03.999
Homework, do you mind?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.585
Here we go.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.671
Ladies and gentlemen, we have lift-off.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.883
Bet you five bucks
those aren't pointy cones.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.935
Damn it! Fucking Scotty did it again.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.106
Right, so where were we?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.150
So, what we've got is pretty good so far.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.444
I was just thinking that, like,
I know you're the story guy,

18:32.528 --> 18:33.862
but when he comes to Earth,

18:33.946 --> 18:37.116
it could just be, like, killing people,

18:37.199 --> 18:39.076
tearing guys' dicks off
with his tentacles,

18:39.159 --> 18:41.870
or slurping their brains out
through a straw?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.545
Or I could shove a grenade
up your ass and blow you up.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.258
What's wrong, Teddy?

18:55.759 --> 18:57.386
Today was four months.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.932
Four months to the day
since-- since Matty.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.146
Yeah, man. So messed up.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.775
Anyway, I'll keep working
on the illustrations.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.527
I'm trying to talk about Matty.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.155
What's talking about it
gonna do, bring him back to life?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.198
They never even found a body.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.908
Don't start this again.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.952
That usually means he's a runaway.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.121
He could have ran away.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.498
-And why would he run away?
-Gee, I don't know.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.500
Maybe because he had
just about no friends

19:28.584 --> 19:29.835
in the whole wide world,

19:29.918 --> 19:31.837
and the only ones he did have
had to be paid

19:31.879 --> 19:33.672
-to go to his birthday.
-We weren't paid.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.300
-Candy isn't money, Teddy.
-Same thing.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.719
His mom offered us
that candy fair and square.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.762
We were doing her a favor, a good deed.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.931
We didn't even know it was his birthday.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.391
Look, whatever happened to Matty

19:44.474 --> 19:46.810
wasn't because we forgot
his stupid birthday, okay?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.566
None of this is our fault!

19:52.649 --> 19:54.902
And whether you accept it or not,
Matty's dea--

20:46.328 --> 20:48.080
Matty, where are we going?

20:49.539 --> 20:50.624
Trust me.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.711
Just one more flight.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.639
It's closed to the public.
Has been for years.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.184
But Phil and Teddy
tried sneaking in one day.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.228
They found out the caretaker
doesn't bother locking

21:11.311 --> 21:13.480
the joint up anymore. You believe that?

21:15.649 --> 21:16.650
-So...

21:17.567 --> 21:20.570
we turned it into
a sort of secret hangout.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.075
The view is beautiful up here.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.716
Nuts. I always get rocket ship.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.302
I got turtle. Trade you?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.055
Sure. Turtles are lucky.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.224
Hey,

21:50.517 --> 21:52.269
don't tell the guys I brought you here.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.187
Phil and Teddy, I mean.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.440
We're not supposed to bring guests

21:56.523 --> 21:58.734
without checking in with each other first.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.111
It's not because
I'm Loony Lilly Bainbridge?

22:02.487 --> 22:05.240
You're not loony.
Not to me.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.291
What happened that day? With your dad.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.507
Sorry, I shouldn't have--

22:27.220 --> 22:29.264
My mom and I went to pick up my dad.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.436
He worked at the jarring plant
out on Willoughby.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.105
You know, pickles and stuff.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.609
We were leaving the factory
when I realized

22:40.692 --> 22:42.611
I'd forgotten something inside.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.657
This mood ring
I just bought at the five-and-dime.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.661
It was just a cheap, stupid toy,

22:51.745 --> 22:53.497
but he went back to get it.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.502
And I don't know-- I don't know,
one of the machines jammed up.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.007
It wasn't even his station, but my dad,

23:05.550 --> 23:07.135
he always wanted to help.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.349
They said he climbed into the gears.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.436
I guess he thought
he'd killed the power, but--

23:17.437 --> 23:19.898
When the foreman realized
it was on another station,

23:19.981 --> 23:21.358
it was too late.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.529
If I hadn't made him go back--

23:25.612 --> 23:26.947
You couldn't have known.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.075
It was just a terrible accident.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.015
Happy New Year.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.978
Thanks for letting me talk about it.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.855
No one else does.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.567
Not Marge. Or the Pattycakes.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.485
You're not like those girls.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.946
Starting to realize that.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.782
For better or for worse, I guess.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.659
For better.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.508
I'm sorry. That was stupid.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.218
No, it's okay.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.095
It's just that we're friends.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.805
It's fine, really.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.308
It is. I should head back anyway.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.769
If my pop catches me out of bed
at this hour, he'll--

24:42.355 --> 24:43.899
I didn't mean it like that.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.777
I gotta go.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.447
Matty, wait!

25:03.335 --> 25:04.336
Lilly.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.673
Don't forget to lay your clothes out
for tomorrow morning.

25:11.927 --> 25:12.928
Remember?

25:13.678 --> 25:16.097
We're going to visit
your father at the cemetery.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.353
If it's all the same,
I don't think I'm gonna go.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.565
It's been a year.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.735
You haven't visited his grave even once.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.446
I know. I'm just...

25:32.948 --> 25:34.074
not ready.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.457
You're not the only person
to have something awful happen to them.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.710
The sooner you realize that, the better.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.755
Don't forget to take your medication.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.106
Friends, the idle brain
is the devil's playground.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.900
Shameless music that'll grab your son

26:08.984 --> 26:12.070
and your daughter with the arms
of a jungle animal instinct.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.280
Mass'steria!

26:14.614 --> 26:17.617
We got trouble.
Right here in River City.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.954
Trouble! Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

26:21.037 --> 26:23.415
Trouble! Trouble!
Trouble! Trouble! Trouble!

26:23.498 --> 26:24.624
Matty, is that you?

26:26.501 --> 26:27.669
Where are you?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.550
Matty, if it's you, if you can hear me,

26:33.633 --> 26:36.678
just come home, all right?
Just please come home.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.391
He won't let me!

26:52.736 --> 26:56.990
Matty Clements speaking to you
through the pipes?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.366
Just forget it.

26:59.534 --> 27:02.037
And seeing as how you barely
said one word to this kid

27:02.120 --> 27:04.331
when he was alive,
why is it that he's reaching out to you

27:04.414 --> 27:05.582
from beyond the grave?

27:11.171 --> 27:12.922
-Hi, Patty.
-Hi, Margie.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.883
Just a sec.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.178
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.472
What are you doing?

27:20.972 --> 27:23.600
Making sure none of her friends
hear you talking like this

27:23.683 --> 27:25.560
because what you're saying is crazy.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.895
And I don't mean to use that word.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.688
-I don't--
-I know what I heard.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.524
Listen to me.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.610
We've only got
two more months till summer.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.528
Let's just get through them
without giving everyone

27:35.612 --> 27:37.322
something new to whisper about you.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.242
About me or about us?

27:44.162 --> 27:45.622
What's that supposed to mean?

27:49.042 --> 27:50.168
It wasn't me.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.718
Are you worried about
what people will think of me

27:58.802 --> 28:01.846
or what Patty and all of them
will think of you because of me?

28:03.223 --> 28:06.643
Jesus, Lill, I'm trying to be your friend,

28:06.726 --> 28:09.104
but sometimes you make it really hard.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.444
That's my point, Teds.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.905
There has to be a reason
why men have nipples.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.031
Think about it.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.909
Maybe it's like
when we used to have tails and gills

28:22.992 --> 28:24.369
and we just evolved out of it.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.329
Or it's nature's way of telling us

28:26.413 --> 28:28.123
that we're second in line
to feed our babies

28:28.206 --> 28:29.499
should anything happen to women.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.334
Like aliens taking them back
to their world.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.419
When that day comes,

28:32.502 --> 28:34.921
you and I are gonna be
breastfeeding like crazy.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.511
What are you doing here?

28:42.887 --> 28:45.807
And how much of that did you hear?

28:47.434 --> 28:49.102
I need to talk to you guys.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.603
Talk to us? About what?

28:50.687 --> 28:53.648
About how they found her dad's body parts
in pickle jars all over Maine?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.692
That's bullshit. It never happened.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.988
He swore he'd keep his mouth shut.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.490
We only brought him here, like, one time.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.660
One time? Weren't you guys best friends?

29:05.785 --> 29:07.120
It's complicated.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.205
Okay, so you're positive
it was Matty, right?

29:09.414 --> 29:11.040
It was his voice, I'm sure.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.501
I don't know what it means. I just--

29:13.585 --> 29:14.753
I thought if anyone would care,

29:14.961 --> 29:17.422
if anyone would believe me,
it'd be you guys.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.509
Don't tell me you're buying
into this cock-a-doodle story.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.011
You mean cockamamie?

29:23.094 --> 29:25.096
It's both of those things. Okay?
This story's insane.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.264
Look who it's coming from.

29:27.432 --> 29:32.771
I know. It sounds impossible,
but maybe it's just improbable.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.775
Teddy, for this to be true,
Matty would have to still be alive.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.526
And he'd have to know
where every single one

29:38.610 --> 29:40.445
of Derry's pipes start and end.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.865
And the exact time that Lilly
was about to take a bath.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.576
And how to aim his voice
down a certain pipe

29:46.659 --> 29:49.370
so he could stick his little finger
up there and wave hello to her.

29:49.996 --> 29:54.334
Phil, you've explained one hundred ways
how aliens have come to Earth.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.004
Tracking our smells,
pretending to be dogs,

29:58.838 --> 30:00.673
-probing our anus.
-"Ani."

30:01.466 --> 30:04.427
You've "proven" all of that to me,

30:04.511 --> 30:06.304
yet you can't just believe

30:06.387 --> 30:11.309
that Matty is trying to get in contact
with someone he actually knows?

30:11.768 --> 30:13.436
So, you do believe me?

30:15.855 --> 30:16.981
Look...

30:18.191 --> 30:20.235
Lilly, I want to. I'm trying to.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.655
There's plenty
of unbelievable things out there

30:23.738 --> 30:26.157
that people believe,
and I'm sure some of them are true.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.203
I'm just not so sure about this one.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.215
I can't believe you gave her your soda.

30:57.981 --> 30:58.982
Come on in, Major.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.361
I wanted you to know that Masters

31:03.444 --> 31:05.488
is gonna spend the week
on latrine duty.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.908
And a citation is going
on his permanent flight record.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.912
I won't stand for that kind
of horseshit on my base.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.374
To less horseshit.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.426
I understand you served
under General Abbott in Korea.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.720
As he tells it, you, Major,

31:28.803 --> 31:31.180
are about the bravest, damn pilot
he's ever met.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.267
You flew a B-29 up MiG Alley
into the teeth

31:34.350 --> 31:36.603
of Soviet anti-aircraft fire at Sui-ho,

31:37.437 --> 31:39.147
and made it back in one piece.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.733
Almost one piece, sir.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.986
And to be frank,
I don't much like to talk about it.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.779
Your injury?

31:48.072 --> 31:49.282
Korea, sir.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.326
And why is that?

31:53.453 --> 31:54.996
Because we didn't finish the job.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.751
Well, that's why
we transferred you up here, Major.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.504
To test our new B-52, and if necessary,

32:03.588 --> 32:05.632
fly it straight
into the heart of the enemy.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.091
Finish what you started.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.765
Why the Air Force?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.392
I was raised on a farm.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.312
We had a family friend
that would come twice a month

32:19.395 --> 32:21.564
to dust the fields. So, my father,

32:22.065 --> 32:23.608
he wanted me to tag along. And I--

32:23.691 --> 32:25.401
I just took to it, you know?

32:27.195 --> 32:28.655
How about you, sir?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.032
My dad.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.576
Army man.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.956
Fought in every American conflict
from the Indian Wars to the Philippines,

32:39.082 --> 32:41.167
‘til they shoved him behind a desk.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.128
Only thing he loved more
than his country was his family.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.800
Told me the proudest moment of his life
was when I signed up to be a Doughboy.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.889
I can only imagine your father
felt the same way.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.892
He was proud, all right.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.646
He used to always say
there's nothing wrong

33:01.729 --> 33:05.566
with this country that can't be fixed
by what's right with this country.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.698
I aim to prove him right, sir.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.932
-Amen.
-Amen.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.308
-Amen.
-Amen.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.112
-Amen.
-Amen.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.872
My son, the bar mitzvah boy.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.832
How's the haftarah studying coming?

34:03.958 --> 34:05.043
Tastes good.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.089
Something the matter, Theodore?

34:13.509 --> 34:14.886
Can I ask you a weird question?

34:16.262 --> 34:17.304
Sure.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.599
Do you think somebody
could kidnap a kid

34:19.681 --> 34:20.850
and keep him underground?

34:22.185 --> 34:24.228
-Underground?
-What is wrong with you?

34:25.688 --> 34:29.859
Yeah, just keep him there,
in the sewers for months and months,

34:29.942 --> 34:31.485
hurting him or...

34:32.737 --> 34:33.905
I don't know.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.991
Have you ever heard
of something like that?

34:38.534 --> 34:41.496
Your grandparents escaped Buchenwald,

34:41.996 --> 34:43.956
their entire families murdered,

34:44.791 --> 34:46.793
the skin of Jewish prisoners

34:48.085 --> 34:49.462
used for lampshades.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.589
What?

34:52.590 --> 34:53.841
Lampshades.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.637
We are Jews, Theodore.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.723
We know better than anyone
the real horrors of this world.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.478
Reality is terrifying enough as it is.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.274
Cut it out with the fantasy.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.168
I can't believe we're related.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.787
I'm next, right?

37:29.413 --> 37:30.915
-So, now you believe me.
-Listen, Lilly,

37:30.998 --> 37:32.667
I've known this guy since first grade.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.918
And I know when he's lying,

37:34.001 --> 37:37.004
and he is not lying
about this lampshade shit.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.339
We have to tell someone.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.758
-No one's gonna believe us.
-What if we go to our parents?

37:41.217 --> 37:44.428
If I tell anyone about all of this,
I'll wind up right back at Juniper Hill.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.014
Maybe you guys will be in there with me.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.934
I can't go to the loony bin, Teddy.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.520
I couldn't make it
through goddamn sleepaway camp.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.063
Okay.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.774
We don't tell anyone,

37:57.483 --> 37:59.402
until we figure out
what really happened to Matty.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.281
And how do we do that?

38:05.950 --> 38:07.576
I think I might know where to start.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.011
You see anything?

38:25.094 --> 38:26.679
Teddy, did you know
that there are more than

38:26.762 --> 38:28.264
a hundred books in this library?

38:28.431 --> 38:30.725
No way. More than a hundred?

38:31.350 --> 38:33.185
And did you know
that some of them have pictures

38:33.269 --> 38:34.520
but most of them don't have pictures?

38:34.645 --> 38:35.646
What is she doing here?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.106
My folks couldn't find a sitter, okay?

38:37.189 --> 38:38.983
And did you know
that when you take out a book,

38:39.191 --> 38:41.360
you have to sign your name?
I can sign mine in cursive.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.280
Miss Carmel says
I have the best handwriting in the class.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.699
Phil.

38:48.451 --> 38:51.662
Hey, Suze, I need a really good handwriter

38:51.746 --> 38:53.664
to help me with finding a book.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.792
It's called Bucket Full of Muffins.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.339
I'll do it.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.385
She'll never find it.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.140
Wait, there it is.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.980
They thought it could be
a runaway initially,

39:18.064 --> 39:19.648
but when he never turned up
anywhere else,

39:19.732 --> 39:21.692
they presumed homicide.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.071
That means murder.

39:26.572 --> 39:29.158
They thought
it could have been Matty's dad.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.620
Could have been a drifter,
but they never found anyone.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.080
"According to police sources,

39:34.163 --> 39:36.540
the boy was last seen
the night of January 4th

39:36.624 --> 39:39.835
at the Capitol Theater
by the daughter of a theater employee,

39:39.919 --> 39:41.962
an unidentified 12-year-old girl."

39:46.258 --> 39:47.468
Who's that?

39:48.552 --> 39:49.887
Matty Clements?

39:50.721 --> 39:53.015
Jesus Christ, get the hell out of here!

39:53.265 --> 39:54.433
-Get out!

39:55.351 --> 39:57.103
What? What did we say?

39:58.604 --> 40:00.648
Do you know how many times
the police came round

40:00.731 --> 40:03.317
about that boy?
Trying to fix it on my pops?

40:04.276 --> 40:07.238
Did your newspaper article
mention anything about that?

40:08.280 --> 40:10.282
I really only skimmed, so--

40:10.366 --> 40:11.492
Just leave!

40:12.118 --> 40:13.619
Can we go get a shake now?

40:15.538 --> 40:18.124
See, I told you guys
this was a bad idea,

40:18.290 --> 40:20.459
chasing a song you heard
in the fucking sewers.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.005
What did you say?

40:31.303 --> 40:32.304
It was a song.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.016
I heard Matty singing it
a couple nights back.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.811
From the drainpipe in my tub.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.023
You heard him too?

40:45.359 --> 40:49.363
I don't know if it was Matty,
but I did hear voices

40:50.197 --> 40:53.909
in the basement of the Capitol,
in the pipes.

40:55.327 --> 40:59.582
Kids laughing, crying, calling my name.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.254
What song was he singing?

42:38.222 --> 42:41.684
The new B-52. G-class.
They transferred you up here to fly it.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.645
If you wanna walk out of here alive,
you're gonna give us the specs.

42:44.728 --> 42:49.108
Speed, range, flight ceiling,
payload, arms, everything.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.317
Understand?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.112
I'd understand you better
if you took off that mask.

42:53.195 --> 42:54.947
The specs. Now.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.283
It's classified.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.591
This isn't a fucking game.

43:13.924 --> 43:17.052
The specs, or I pull the trigger
on the count of three.

43:19.930 --> 43:20.973
One.

43:28.689 --> 43:29.732
Two.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.778
You're gonna have to pull that trigger.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.159
-Leroy!
-Yo, Lee, what's going on?

43:40.242 --> 43:41.994
Lee, open the door!

43:46.123 --> 43:48.459
Open the door! Yo, Lee,
what's going on in there?

43:48.542 --> 43:50.044
Open the door!

43:50.127 --> 43:51.837
Lee, open the fucking door!

44:07.269 --> 44:08.646
Get the fuck out of here!

44:09.313 --> 44:11.315
Yeah, that's what I thought.

44:15.569 --> 44:16.820
Saved your ass again.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.157
-Fuck you, Pauly.
-Who the fuck were those guys?

44:20.240 --> 44:21.408
I don't know.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.286
Jesus Christ.

44:27.706 --> 44:28.916
How's my hair?

44:30.626 --> 44:31.627
It's still greasy.

44:38.133 --> 44:39.426
So, where the hell are we going?

44:39.510 --> 44:41.970
You want me to tell you
or you want me to show you?

44:42.096 --> 44:44.348
Tell. One hundred percent tell.

44:44.431 --> 44:47.393
The song Matty was singing comes
from the movie The Music Man.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.978
We should have another print
up in the storage room.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.483
And why do we wanna watch
this stupid thing?

44:54.942 --> 44:56.527
I hate musicals.

44:57.403 --> 44:59.905
Because maybe Matty was trying
to tell us something.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.085
Holy crap, it's dark in here.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.547
Guys, isn't this breaking and entering?

45:16.630 --> 45:18.590
We didn't break anything.
It's just entering.

45:18.674 --> 45:20.759
-Don't be such a baby.
-Guys, stop.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.302
Let's just sit.

45:37.359 --> 45:38.444
Just a second!

45:38.527 --> 45:40.446
Loading up The Music Man!

45:46.076 --> 45:47.244
Teds, is that you?

45:48.829 --> 45:51.415
-Is he crying?
-What? No.

45:51.957 --> 45:53.208
Shut up, you guys.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.754
Lilly, are you okay?

45:58.297 --> 46:00.466
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I'm just...

46:02.301 --> 46:04.136
...thinking about Matty
and what happened,

46:04.219 --> 46:06.388
and what I could have
done different, and--

46:06.472 --> 46:07.639
Well, he needed me.

46:09.099 --> 46:10.934
And instead, I just sent him away.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.270
Then he was gone.

46:15.647 --> 46:16.982
What we did was worse.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.736
Maybe if we'd been there
like we said we would

46:20.819 --> 46:23.530
at his birthday, maybe things
would be different.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.407
It's nobody's fault, okay?

46:26.700 --> 46:29.995
Teds, it's not your fault.
Lilly, it isn't your fault either.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.122
We're here now. That's what matters.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.624
So just stop it, okay?

46:37.544 --> 46:38.754
Are you crying?

46:39.421 --> 46:41.089
What? No, I'm not crying.

46:41.715 --> 46:43.050
Nobody's crying.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.552
...with Sen-Sen
One fine night

46:45.636 --> 46:46.845
They leave the pool hall

46:46.929 --> 46:48.305
Heading for the dance
At the Arm'ry

46:48.388 --> 46:50.057
Libertine men
And scarlet women

46:50.140 --> 46:52.142
And ragtime
Shameless music...

46:53.060 --> 46:54.186
With the arms

46:54.269 --> 46:56.688
Of a jungle animal instinct,
mass'steria!

46:56.772 --> 46:59.066
Friends, the idle brain
Is the devil's playground

46:59.149 --> 47:00.567
-Trouble
-Oh, we got trouble

47:00.651 --> 47:02.361
Right here in River City

47:02.444 --> 47:04.112
With a capital T
And that rhymes with P

47:04.196 --> 47:06.240
-And that stands for "pool"
-That stands for "pool"

47:06.323 --> 47:08.200
-We've surely got trouble
-We've surely got trouble

47:08.283 --> 47:09.910
It's the song. That's the song I heard.

47:09.993 --> 47:11.036
Figure out a way

47:11.119 --> 47:13.163
To keep the young ones
Moral after school

47:13.247 --> 47:15.165
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble

47:15.249 --> 47:16.625
Trouble, trouble, trouble

47:16.708 --> 47:18.293
Mothers of River City

47:18.377 --> 47:20.379
Heed that warning
Before it's too late...

47:23.298 --> 47:25.467
Creeping into his conversation

47:25.884 --> 47:28.178
-Words like
-Trouble, trouble, trouble

47:28.262 --> 47:30.389
-Like "swell"?
-Trouble, trouble, trouble

47:31.098 --> 47:32.266
And "so's your old man"?

47:32.349 --> 47:33.350
Trouble, trouble, trouble

47:33.475 --> 47:35.686
If so, my friends,
You got trouble

47:35.769 --> 47:36.812
Oh, we got trouble

47:36.895 --> 47:38.605
-Right here in River City
-Right here in River City

47:38.689 --> 47:40.232
With a capital T
And that rhymes with...

47:41.108 --> 47:42.109
Matty?

47:42.192 --> 47:44.069
-We've surely got trouble
-We've surely got trouble...

47:46.780 --> 47:49.199
Wait, what? What's going on?

47:49.992 --> 47:51.785
How is he in the goddamn movie?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.370
What's happening?
How is this possible?

47:53.453 --> 47:55.080
-Can he see us?
-Matty!

47:55.956 --> 47:57.499
-Is he listening?
-Matty!

47:57.583 --> 47:58.750
Matty, we're over here! Matty!

47:58.834 --> 47:59.918
-Matty!
-Hey!

48:00.043 --> 48:02.546
-Follow our voices!
-Matty! Wait.

48:02.629 --> 48:05.090
-Yes! Come on, Matty!
-Yes! Yes, Matty, that's it!

48:05.173 --> 48:06.800
-Follow our voices!
-We're right here! Keep going!

48:06.925 --> 48:08.343
Matty, yes!

48:08.427 --> 48:10.470
Yes, that's right! Yes!

48:10.554 --> 48:11.763
Matty, come on!

48:12.723 --> 48:14.641
Lilly? Teddy?

48:14.725 --> 48:16.727
-Yeah, it's us!
-Come on!

48:16.810 --> 48:18.770
Matty, come on, we're gonna get you out!

48:20.939 --> 48:22.107
No, you won't.

48:23.358 --> 48:24.860
You're the reason I'm in here.

48:25.611 --> 48:26.904
'Cause you lied.

48:29.865 --> 48:32.159
'Cause you weren't there.

48:33.827 --> 48:35.037
What's happening?

49:08.487 --> 49:09.655
What the hell is that?

49:18.747 --> 49:21.208
-Where did it go?
-What the fuck is that thing?

49:21.291 --> 49:24.127
I told you weird shit was going on
over at that airbase!

49:24.211 --> 49:26.672
They made a giant, fucking mutant baby!

49:41.812 --> 49:43.188
Come on, Susie!

49:44.731 --> 49:47.859
Go, go, go! Susie, come on! Run!

49:53.031 --> 49:54.741
Come on!

50:27.858 --> 50:29.568
No! No!

50:32.779 --> 50:33.989
Susie!

50:34.740 --> 50:35.741
Lilly!

50:36.241 --> 50:37.325
Come on!

50:39.995 --> 50:41.204
Here you go.

50:43.123 --> 50:44.291
Give me your hand.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.737
Lilly! Lilly!

51:15.530 --> 51:17.491
Lilly!

51:17.574 --> 51:19.743
Lilly! What happened?

51:19.826 --> 51:22.871
They're all gone.
-No.

51:44.810 --> 51:46.520
What do you mean
they're all gone?

51:46.603 --> 51:48.021
What happened?
