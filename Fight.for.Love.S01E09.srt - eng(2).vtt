No one else is here,

just you and me.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.480
In broad daylight?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.760
- That's not appropriate.
- Come on.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.000
You bad boy.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.120
Yun, Lady Yu.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.180
- Listen.
- You're so bad.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.040
We would never...

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.630
We would never

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.630
stoop to eavesdropping.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.590
Why?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.230
Don't you want the Crown Prince?

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.430
He's inside.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.080
- Listen.
- Come catch me.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.920
Hurry.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.150
Come on.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.080
Got you.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.550
You cheated.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.960
No one will find out, right?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.990
It's just us.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.990
Really?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
Don't run.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.470
Don't be shy.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.190
Stop it.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.150
What are you doing?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.590
Just what you're thinking.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.310
You knew this all along?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.280
The Crown Prince is engaged

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
to our Tuantuan.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.310
So of course I bribed an

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.680
Eastern Palace eunuch to keep an eye on him.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.470
He even bought a dancer

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.750
from Fragrance House the other day.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
I paid a lot of silver

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.710
for that information.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.080
I was about to talk to him.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.400
And since you happened to need him,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.750
perfect.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.840
Two birds with one stone.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.400
What two birds with one

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.870
stone?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.310
You just want me to help you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.150
catch him cheating.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.750
But didn't I help you

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.590
find him?

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.960
And you said

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.910
going straight to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.030
the Eastern Palace would look bad.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080
I only knew he'd be here.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.150
I must've been crazy

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.000
to ask for your help.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400
But I did help, didn't I?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.360
Enough.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.200
Stop arguing.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.700
We all want the Crown Prince.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.800
Since he's here,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.990
handle the serious matter first.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.240
Lady Chu is right.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.750
Yun,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.590
open the door.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520
How would I open it?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.280
You need me to teach you?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.590
Like this

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.240
and this.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.360
Then it will open.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.030
Go on, open it.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.910
Why don't you do it?

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.870
I'm not the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.920
You do it.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.720
I can't.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.120
You can, hurry.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.840
Go on.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.470
Come on.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.400
Come on.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.310
Stop it.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.160
Come on, come on.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.350
Who's there?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.590
Your Highness!

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.560
Lady Chu is impressive.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.000
- Greetings,
- Greetings,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.360
Your Highness.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.870
You barged into my room

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.470
without summons.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.600
I could punish you for that, you know.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.830
Oh, you dare?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.070
Keeping a mistress in an inn,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.150
you know it can't be seen.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.790
Your are about to marry Tuantuan,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.950
yet you do something

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.000
this disgraceful.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.240
How are we supposed to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.190
entrust Tuantuan to you?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.720
As if your reputation outside

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.600
is spotless, Song Wenchang.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.870
And I'm the Crown Prince.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.160
I will have a harem in the future.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.550
After the wedding,

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.880
Qingping will be Crown Princess,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.360
and one day Empress.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.270
Should an Empress

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.720
not tolerate other consorts?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720
Can you compare yourself to me?

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.540
I've never had a betrothal.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.270
If I make a promise to a lady,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.150
I would never be

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.010
as fickle as you.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.800
Your Highness is correct.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.680
Forcing our way into your quarters

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.600
is indeed a capital offense.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.450
I will go to His Majesty now,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.800
explain everything,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.270
and accept punishment.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.620
I as well.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.250
I came today

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.250
by order of the Eldest Princess,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.120
but forcing entry was improper.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.510
I will

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.920
return and beg her

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.760
pardon.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.440
But...

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.760
Right,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.440
I'll inform my father and Tuantuan.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.400
Stop.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.750
Whatever you intend to do,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.950
at least choose an appropriate place.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.600
Hot wontons.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.870
Her Highness used a pouch

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.950
to lead me to the inn,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.310
she clearly knew what

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.680
the Crown Prince was doing.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.680
But she's his aunt.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.750
Why have me catch him in the act?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.920
Wouldn't that harm the royal family's
reputation?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.560
She is his aunt,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.870
but compared to him,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.310
she cares more about Lady Song

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.630
of the Duke of Hu's mansion,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.560
Song Qingping.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.840
This Lady Song

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.240
has long treated Her Highness's

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.120
chronic headaches

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.350
and helped her greatly.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.120
So the Emperor betrothed her

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.960
to the Crown Prince.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.040
Her Highness likely couldn't act openly,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.070
so she had you run this errand.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.190
First, to warn the Crown Prince

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.360
for her and Lady Song.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.830
Second, to help our Wei family.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.510
A plan that serves two sides,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.430
clearly with Mr. Xue's touch.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.350
But catching

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.480
the Crown Prince cheating

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.000
isn't exactly glorious.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.880
You

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.680
won't spread this, right?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.560
Do I look like someone who gossips?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.590
If you don't

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
speak of it,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.310
neither will I.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.320
Good.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.430
Looks like you won't need to worry

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.950
about tomorrow's banquet anymore.

the Wei family will not fall.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.870
I will carry the Wei name for you,

defend the nation and the throne,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.480
hold no regrets.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.720
Uncle Yun,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
who are we still waiting for?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.440
Why aren't we eating?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.320
So impatient.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.360
Mother said many ladies

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.550
and gentlemen would come today.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.030
But it's been two whole hours.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.720
Did they get lost?

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.550
Uncle Yun,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.240
should we go find them?

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.720
I am hungry.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.350
Lingmo,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.630
didn't you just have snacks?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.470
Hungry again?

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.960
Go play with your brother.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.230
Let's eat.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.110
Tell the kitchen

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.420
to bring the dishes to the hall.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.840
We'll eat by ourselves.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.060
(Defend the nation and the throne)

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.560
Yun,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.960
I have an unreasonable request.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.270
After today,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.670
we're leaving the Wei Mansion.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.750
Before we go,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.480
I want to take one thing of Qin's

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.240
as remembrance.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.080
Of course.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.960
What would you

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.960
like to take?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.510
When Wei Qin was alive,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.270
his spear was his treasure,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.790
full of his marks.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.840
I want to take it.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.800
Can I?

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.110
Han,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.390
those spears

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.150
were forged by the seven

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.220
of them together.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.870
Just leave them here,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.880
it's like the brothers are reunited.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.840
Yes.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.150
Chun is right.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.960
No,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.840
take it.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.630
I can't bear to part with it,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.200
but in the end,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.240
it's only an object.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.200
They

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.120
may never have the chance

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.960
to go to war again.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.020
If seeing the spear

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.510
lets you remember your days

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.480
here with my brothers,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.440
then that's the best use of them.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.240
And my brothers

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.150
would surely be glad.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.680
Yun,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.440
thank you.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.920
Alright.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.600
Enough waiting.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.440
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.040
Just a little bit.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.040
Yes.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.870
Maybe they're already at the gate.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.150
Let's go check.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.420
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.030
Han, take the children

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.200
to the back garden.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.720
Go on.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.560
Let's go.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.790
That day you insisted

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.200
on this banquet,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.600
did you imagine this scene?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.550
Whether they come is their choice;

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.150
whether we hold

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.440
the banquet is ours.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.720
Do all we can, leave the rest to fate.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.870
If you don't even dare try,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.750
not even an immortal

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.870
could save you.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.320
You personally delivered an invitation

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.160
to Her Highness.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.200
And I invited the Crown Prince.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.150
But look at the result.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.480
We did our part,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.000
but fate is decided.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.920
Then

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.040
let's bet:

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.350
Obverse—

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.350
someone will come.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.960
Reverses—no one will.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.350
Dare you?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.040
Why not?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.710
See?

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.080
Fate has spoken.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.960
People will come today.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.680
Yu,

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.080
General Chu and Lady Jin have arrived.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.510
The first to watch the joke is here.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.160
Please.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.870
- Linyang, you're here.
- Yu.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.990
Are we late?

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.670
Thank you for coming, General Chu.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.960
Not late,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.800
just right.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.550
See? I told you.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.390
Why rush?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.000
Even if we arrived an hour later,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.200
we'd still be first.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.630
Maybe even last.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.030
Jin,

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.510
today is an important day.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.840
Behave yourself.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.670
If you cause trouble,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.840
you'll regret it.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.000
I came to support you,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
yet you're ungrateful.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.120
Oh, Chu Yu,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.510
you schemed so hard to marry

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.440
into the Wei family,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.720
what did you gain?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.550
Not a single guest came to this banquet.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.000
If not for Linyang and me,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.240
the Wei family's

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.550
disgrace would reach the heavens.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.600
And you still put on airs.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.440
Jin!

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.000
I'm not wrong, am I?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.560
My sister was rude.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.050
Please forgive her, Marquis Wei.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.510
General Chu, don't call me that.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.240
I'm not the Marquis yet.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.080
Don't worry.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.120
On our way here,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.390
we saw many carriages.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.510
I think they're waiting for the right moment.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.990
The right moment?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.840
Probably waiting to see

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.720
who comes first.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.030
The Eldest Princess has arrived.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.590
The moment's here.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.520
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.040
Rise.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.350
Your Highness.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.790
I didn't expect you to truly come.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.960
I'm not late, am I?

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.750
You arrived perfectly.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.000
I actually hadn't planned to come,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.510
but when I heard no one else was here,

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.160
my interest grew.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.590
And thank you

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.200
for standing up for Tuantuan.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.000
Hanmei prepared gifts for you.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.670
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.030
Well then, aren't you going to

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.270
arrange a good seat for me?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.150
This way, Your Highness.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.830
Please come inside.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.310
General Wei.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.920
- Young Master Sun has arrived.
- Please.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.130
- Alright.
- As for soup,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.000
check if the guests like it

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.990
- or not.
- Minister Gu has arrived!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.390
- If not, don't serve it.
- Yes.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.350
- Go ahead.
- Censor Chen.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.190
Yes.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.710
- Vice Minister Tong.
- You came quick early.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.110
Together?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.950
Alright.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.670
Yun,

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.070
how could the three prodigies of the

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.310
Duke of Hu's Manor not be here today?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.040
Slowly.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.040
Three steps ahead.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.200
Yes, go on, go on.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.390
Go.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.110
Careful, steps.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.750
I've met Mr. Song.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.270
These two are...?

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.160
Okay, steady, steady.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.270
The lady in yellow

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.030
is the Duke of Hu's only daughter,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.440
Song Qingping, much favored

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.510
by the Eldest Princess.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.510
The elegant gentleman

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.160
is Song Wenchang's half-brother,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.000
Song Shilan.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.080
The three of them

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.550
grew up together.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.720
But it's changed now.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.150
Yun,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.960
this is the gift

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.880
I personally chose for you.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.800
Come on, carry it inside.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480
Careful with your steps.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.750
Lift it.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.680
Higher. Yes.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.520
Look out.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.240
Slowly, yes.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.240
Look, that is...

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.160
General Wei,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.600
my brother

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.240
spent a whole day choosing

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.750
and crafting this himself.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.590
He really put

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.110
his heart into it.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.910
Do you see it?

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.590
This is the gift

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.960
I, Song Wenchang,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.800
prepared for General Wei.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.000
Guess what's inside.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.280
(True Might)
what's inside

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.070
to match his status?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.960
Must be quite the treasure.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.000
I will never

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.110
give ordinary gifts.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.550
You're Lady Chu Yu?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.800
Yes.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.310
I didn't get to greet you earlier.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.560
No matter.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.720
I came to thank you.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.680
I heard you helped a lot

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.960
with the Crown Prince issue.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.750
I'll reconsider

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.000
my marriage with him.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.630
Lady Chu Yu,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.440
you can call me Tuantuan.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.030
Tuantuan.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.960
Hiding it so mysteriously,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.720
is it made of gold?

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.670
Don't rush.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200
A moment like this

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.240
needs some buildup.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.550
Stop teasing.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.400
Open it already.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.000
It's just a rockery?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.750
What do you mean "just" a rockery?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200
There's

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.240
great meaning behind it.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.550
This golden miniature mountain

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.640
- Actually a rockery?
- symbolizes

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.830
my hopes for General Wei:

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.510
that he stands firm like Mt. Tai,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.550
unshaken

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.400
in hardship,

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.750
and even if he falls,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.200
he can rise again.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.750
Congratulations, General Wei.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.870
Yun, since I

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.310
learned you'd succeed the marquisate,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.070
I ordered this made

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.270
in the likeness of Mt. Tai.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.750
I wish you steadiness

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.590
and strength

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.000
as the Zhenguo Marquis.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.670
Do you like it?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.680
Today is a thank-you banquet.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920
Marquisate?

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.590
We waited half the day

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.920
and saw no title bestowed.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.550
Such a waste of my time.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.310
Such a pretty girl,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720
why so sour-tongued?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.110
Who are you?

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.040
My sister.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.720
So you're the famed

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.960
first beauty of Huajing,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.200
Lady Chu.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.160
But what you said isn't quite right.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.190
Jin,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.510
what did I just tell you?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.720
What's wrong with me telling the truth?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.790
Lady Chu Jin, huh?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.550
Let me broaden your horizons.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.640
Are you still my friend or not?

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.400
When will you show up already?

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.200
His Highness the Crown Prince arrives!

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.640
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.000
Rise.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.630
Wei Yun,

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.350
receive the decree.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.720
By Heaven's mandate, the Emperor

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.440
confers upon Wei Yun,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.030
for his talent,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.440
virtue,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.790
and loyal service,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.270
the title of Marquis of Zhenguo

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.590
of the Great Sui,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.360
grants him the Fish Tally,

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.310
and appoints him

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.130
Commander of

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.310
the Arsenal Bureau.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.920
(Imperial Edict)
He'll supervise the Bureau.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.550
Thus decreed.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.640
I, Wei Yun,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.480
receive the decree

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.400
and thank His Majesty.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.510
(This is the Fish Tally to enter
the Arsenal Bureau.)

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.800
I know

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.240
you now favor the civil faction

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.680
led by Duke of Ning.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.330
But since his accession, His Majesty

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.680
has always sought to balance civil
and military power.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.320
You knowingly break this balance,

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.490
forming factions for private gain.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.830
If His Majesty learns of it...

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.950
That's right.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.790
You might lose your position

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.400
as the Crown Prince.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.920
I'm his only son.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.270
What, will Father depose me?

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.790
His Majesty won't remove the heir,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.030
but you haven't inherited the throne yet.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.550
Great Sui is still His Majesty's.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.750
If you continue to favor civil over military,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.160
once you inherit the throne...

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.590
Among the generals,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.160
only the Wei clan

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.590
can still deter foreign enemies.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.920
If they decline as well,

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.310
and Great Sui and North Qi

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.200
go to war again,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.520
Your Highness

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.550
will have to lead the army yourself.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.030
Please think carefully.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.900
Whether the Wei clan survives

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.750
depends entirely on Your Highness.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.190
Your Highness,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.160
about General Wei going to Fragrance House

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.240
during his mourning period,

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.550
can this matter be dismissed?

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.960
As for the Marquis visiting

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.280
Fragrance House while in mourning,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.630
His Majesty has investigated.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.830
It was a misunderstanding.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.550
It was...

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.720
Mr. Song who

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.550
caused trouble there,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.880
and the Marquis

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.310
stepped in

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.550
only to help

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.000
a friend.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.280
You should

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.310
bear the blame, not him.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.150
Mr. Song,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.590
isn't that right?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.480
Yes.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.830
Yes, of course.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.760
Yun,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.800
it's all my fault.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.310
I was young and foolish.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.560
I caused trouble

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.200
and made you clean up after me.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.590
And now

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.310
it's blown up into this huge joke.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.190
Thankfully His Majesty

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.110
saw the truth

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.320
and cleared your name,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.830
or I'd feel

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.200
terrible.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.200
Since you know

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.720
you're ignorant

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.270
and idle,

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.200
you should

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.590
improve yourself.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.640
If there's another "misunderstanding,"

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.550
forget Father,

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.680
I won't spare you either.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.040
(For my friend,)

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.240
(I'll endure this.)

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.880
(What can you do to me?)

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.750
Thank you for the warning, Your Highness.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.070
Didn't expect I'd end up taking all the blame.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.510
I don't care, Yun.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.840
I treat you so well,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.830
you'd better treat me well too.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.110
Thanks,

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.520
my friend.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.520
Anytime.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.720
Marquis.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:08.460
(Defend the nation and the throne)

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:30.660
(True Might)

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.000
Congratulations, Marquis.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.920
Today I receive His Majesty's favor,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.750
inherit the duty of my forebears,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.590
don armor,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.030
defend the realm.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.310
I offer this wine

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.040
to honor my ancestors

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.520
and to all of you.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.310
May the world know peace

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.310
and live in clarity.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.720
Today, I helped the Wei Mansion

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.880
by creating the right moment,

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.590
a congratulatory gift of sorts.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.510
Are you satisfied, Chu Yu?

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.560
My thanks, Your Highness.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.680
I should leave now.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.040
Huan,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.510
come with me.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.680
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.720
No need.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.750
The flowers in Qinxi Valley are in full bloom.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.640
I'm going to enjoy them.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.510
Goodbye, Your Highness.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.270
Your Highness.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.800
(True Might)
- A toast to you.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840
- Everyone.
- Cheers.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.190
General Chu.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.790
- Mr. Song.
- Yun.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.960
- Linyang.
- Yu.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.800
Thank you.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.920
Linyang,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.200
you must drink more today.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.630
Alright.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.670
Marquis Wei.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.320
Come on.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.110
Congratulations.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.840
Chu Yu,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.400
did you marry into the Wei family

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.310
to investigate a case?

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.510
If so,

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.660
I'm now Minister of Justice,

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.060
I can help you.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.140
I went through all the files

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.420
on Lord of Qin's treason case

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.460
and found shocking things,

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.020
very likely

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.340
tied to the Chu

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.460
and Wei families.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.780
This isn't the place to talk.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.900
The Lord of Qin treason case

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.900
was over twenty years ago.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.890
Why do you want to investigate?

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.820
Have you forgotten

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.820
why I was exiled?

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.780
Six years ago,

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.140
the Gu family was implicated.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.860
To save my life, my father

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.220
took the blame.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.020
With General Chu's plea,

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.380
I was

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.580
only exiled.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.820
You mean

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.780
there was more to the case?

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.460
When Lord of Qin traveled south,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.780
he fell in love with a woman.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.140
She later bore him a son.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.860
He promised her happiness,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.500
but after he returned,

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.620
he was accused of colluding with North Qi.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.900
During the investigation,

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.380
that woman took Great Sui's

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.860
secrets and fled back to North Qi,

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.860
causing three of our cities

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.940
to fall into their hands.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.660
Since then,

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.220
many of our people have been

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.820
unable to return home.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.460
(Lord of Qin case file)

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.780
(The woman was North Qi's Princess Yunyang)

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.580
(Leaked military plans to the enemy)

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.860
So

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.740
she deceived Lord of Qin.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.700
She was

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.340
Princess Yunyang of North Qi,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.420
and her child

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.500
returned to North Qi with her.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.060
If Lord of Qin was framed,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.100
your father was framed too.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.860
Though it's been fifteen years,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.820
all of this could've been

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.380
North Qi's scheme.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.860
North Qi has never stopped coveting Great Sui.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.980
They're cunning

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.940
and ruthless,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.060
willing to pay any price

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.540
to devour us.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.060
The battle at Baidi Valley

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.180
was suspicious.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.260
Surely you came to the Wei family

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.780
trying to uncover something.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.740
Gu Chusheng,

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.900
when the Chu family fell,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.420
was there not something strange?

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.820
And do you remember

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.580
it was my father who pleaded

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.860
for yours in court?

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.020
How can you forget that case?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.860
I didn't forget it.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.660
If I hadn't gone to the Court,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.180
I wouldn't know any of this.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.100
- Now it's still...
- It's too late.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.660
Who is it?

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.060
Open the door!

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.220
Someone is targeting us!

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.460
Narcotic Incense...

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.460
Stay away from me.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.580
Mr. Gu,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.860
your beauty is with you.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.300
That's as far as I help you.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.900
I may be low,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.700
but not this vile.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.260
Yu...

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.820
I'm sorry.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.700
I was careless.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.340
Jin,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.780
I have something big to tell you.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.060
You always hated

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.900
that Chu Yu, right?

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.700
Today I avenged you.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.980
I drugged Chu Yu

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.660
and locked her in a room with Mr. Gu.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:10.900
Is that true?

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.460
She bullied you before,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.900
so today I paid her back in full.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.260
Everyone,

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.300
everyone!

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.900
I just went to the backyard

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.500
and saw something

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.260
indescribable.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.740
Interested?

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.900
Come with me!

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.380
Well...

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.380
- Let's go.
- Let's see.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.220
We should take a look.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.100
Let's go.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.940
Who would've thought

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.140
someone would have a secret tryst

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.140
at the Young Marquis's banquet?

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.580
Society is truly decaying.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.460
Good thing I was quick

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.940
and locked them inside.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:46.980
What are you waiting for?

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.860
Open the door!

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.260
Go on.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.660
Young Master Sun,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.380
must you push this so far?

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.180
Today's

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.340
Marquis Wei's banquet,

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.980
making a scene

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.700
helps no one.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.020
General Chu, you're wrong.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.740
If we let this go,

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.380
we'll only encourage corruption.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.900
Why are you stopping me?

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.900
Do you know something?

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.540
Young Master Sun,

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.180
what are you looking for?

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.100
Impossible!

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.140
I swear there were two people.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.260
Jin,

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.380
I was not lying!

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.140
What are you saying?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.420
What does this have to do with me?

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.260
But...

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.180
Here's what happened:

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.620
Just now,

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.620
I was tired,

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.260
so after urging the dishes,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.780
I came here to rest.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.100
But the door

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.900
suddenly locked.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.220
Could this be

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.820
Young Master Sun's doing?

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.020
Trying to ruin my reputation

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.420
with nothing but words?

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.740
That's right!

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.100
We can all testify for Yu.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.860
- Yes!
- Impossible!

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.580
There were two people.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.660
I saw it with my own eyes!

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.500
How did you stand up?

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.780
What are you implying?

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.940
If I don't stand,

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.700
what posture should I use

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.580
to face everyone?

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.940
Innocent people are fearless.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.740
If you don't believe me,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.580
search all you want.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.340
But if you find nothing,

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.940
don't blame me for being rude.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.740
Impossible!

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.840
There were definitely two people!

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.700
Wei Qiu.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:15.940
Here!

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.300
Young Master Sun spread rumors

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.620
and caused trouble

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.860
at Marquis Wei's succession banquet.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.460
Such disruption,

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.060
where does that put our lord's dignity?

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.540
Take him

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.820
to the magistrate.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.380
- Yes.
- Wait!

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.260
- Move!
- No!

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.100
There were two people!

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.980
Believe me!

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.180
Please believe me!

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.580
Yu.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.580
It was all a misunderstanding.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.740
Chun,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.860
look after the guests.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.340
I need some rest.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:46.940
Everyone, please.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.020
Yu.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.020
Give me some time, Linyang.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.260
But you...

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.100
I'm fine.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.500
Jin,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.740
come with me.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.620
What's so special about this place

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.940
that keeps Tuantuan lingering so long?

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.900
Don't tell me

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.140
you fancy Marquis Wei

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.820
and can't bear to leave.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.620
Just now whose eyes

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
were fixed on Lady Chu Jin?

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.980
Shilan called you three times

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.940
before you came out.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.940
Now you're projecting onto others?

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.500
I am nearly

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.500
twenty.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.340
Shouldn't I focus on

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.420
my future marriage?

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.740
Tuantuan, you are simply regretful

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.580
that you couldn't take the pulse

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.990
of Lady Chu, who suddenly felt unwell.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.100
Only Shilan understands me.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.660
Chu Yu helped me out,

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.020
and I did nothing for her.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.180
Our brother and Marquis Wei

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.020
are close.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.340
You'll have

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.500
plenty of chances to repay

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.580
Lady Chu Yu.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.460
Come on.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.660
Linyang, walk slowly.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.620
My foot hurts.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.100
Linyang.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.340
Linyang!

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.580
Young Master Sun did that.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.740
It had nothing to do

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.660
with me.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.940
I already scolded him!

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.420
Linyang,

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.380
I swear

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.020
I'll cut ties with him from now on.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.140
I did everything I could.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.940
Linyang, please don't ignore me.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.580
One should not make their family look bad.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.420
You seem to forget,

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.780
but I haven't.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.500
We'll

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.740
settle this at home.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.840
General Chu.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
I went

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.940
to several clinics

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.780
nearby.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.940
It's too late,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.260
the physicians

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.100
can't come.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.460
Should I

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.940
try farther?

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.040
Brother, my medical box.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.900
Okay.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.740
General Chu.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.340
Lady Song.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.300
General,

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.020
are you looking for a doctor

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.180
to treat Lady Chu Yu?

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.020
I know some medicine,

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.860
perhaps I can help.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.420
It's so late,

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.620
will this be too much a trouble for you?

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.660
Not at all.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.500
Treating Lady Chu Yu

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.860
is never a trouble.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.780
Why are you back again?

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.860
Seeing off guests

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.620
is handled by Chun and the others.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.580
And I hid the fact

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:07.860
that you were drugged.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.660
So,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.660
I couldn't just

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.500
leave you alone.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.740
Don't worry,

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.860
I'm not bored enough

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.580
to come back just to laugh at you.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.940
If you didn't want to watch a joke,

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.420
why did I end up trapped

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.020
by Young Master Sun?

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.940
If you hadn't let your brother hold me off,

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.940
how would Sun have succeeded?

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.380
Besides,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.580
didn't I help you get Gu Chusheng away?

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.500
You took him away

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.340
to protect

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.700
your family's reputation,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.420
not for me.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.020
You're part of the Wei family now.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.700
Its reputation

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.460
is yours too.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.300
Where did you take him?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.700
Father clearly said

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.780
we shouldn't attend the banquet.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.700
Why did you come?

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.300
And

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.060
why did Marquis Wei

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.100
tell me to "watch you carefully"

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.060
when he put you in the carriage?

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.540
What did you do?

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.500
Looks like, true or false,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.580
you and Chu Yu

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.020
will always

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.660
be tangled.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.940
I

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.020
am always the outsider.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.500
Don't overthink.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.100
Look at you.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.500
How can I not?

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.420
Since you

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.580
admit I'm part of the Wei family,

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.340
you won't refuse

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.700
a small request like escorting me

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.620
back to my room, right?

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:53.860
In my arms

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.500
or on my back?

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.900
Can I choose neither?
