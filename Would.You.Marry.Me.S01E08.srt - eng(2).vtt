00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.230
Why are you sighing?

00:13:12.313 --> 00:13:13.523
It's not like you.

00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:17.568
Am I not allowed to sigh?

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:21.364
Why? Because I was born on the third base?

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:25.701
Did you take it to heart?

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:27.036
Yes.

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:29.831
And that I'm not attractive as a woman.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:32.250
I took it deep into my heart.

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:37.922
I'm joking.

00:13:38.714 --> 00:13:40.049
You look so serious.

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:42.009
I'm always serious.

00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:46.472

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:52.895
Have you told him?

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:55.148
Pardon?

00:13:55.231 --> 00:13:56.941
To the person you've liked
since you were kids.

00:13:57.316 --> 00:13:58.526
It looks like you've confessed.

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:11.038
This isn't something
you should be embarrassed about.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:14.709
If you hadn't done anything,
you would've regretted it someday.

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:18.838
If you can't stop thinking about it,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.756
you can run with me.

That's why he helped you out.

00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:53.372
Because he felt bad.

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:54.957
He wanted to pay you back.

00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.210
What you're feeling toward her

00:14:57.293 --> 00:14:59.921
is just guilt, not love.

has someone else in his heart.

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.945
So, I got in the way, childishly.

[♪ gentle, poignant music playing]

00:25:14.535 --> 00:25:17.412

unless they registered their marriage.

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:25.170
It was because she was getting older,
but they kept postponing the wedding.

[chuckles softly]

00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:31.760

my daughter a divorcée.

I told you, it's not your fault.

00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:35.889
It is.

00:25:36.473 --> 00:25:39.101
It's my fault that she became a divorcée.

00:25:39.518 --> 00:25:42.062
It's because I pushed her into it.

00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:45.065
So, if you want to blame someone,
blame me, okay?

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:46.900
No, ma'am.

00:25:46.984 --> 00:25:48.902
Such things aren't important to me.

00:25:48.986 --> 00:25:52.656
But your family
should also be okay with it.

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:54.032
Mom.

00:25:54.116 --> 00:25:55.701
Stop going overboard.

00:25:55.784 --> 00:25:57.119
I'm not.

Anyway, if your family mistreats my Meri,

00:26:16.346 --> 00:26:17.764
I won't let her marry you.

00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:20.559
I can't let her live like that.

00:26:20.642 --> 00:26:24.188
Even if it's just for a day, [taps table]
she should live feeling loved.

Okay, ma'am.

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:30.402
But actually, I don't have any parents.

00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:32.362
I only have my grandmother.

00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:34.865
And she really sees people
for who they are,

00:26:34.948 --> 00:26:36.033
so don't worry.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.868
That's a relief.

00:26:38.493 --> 00:26:41.997
I also don't expect anything
from the man who'll marry my daughter.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.874
I'll be happy if he's healthy

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:47.544
and all is well
as long as Meri is cherished.

00:26:49.087 --> 00:26:50.339

[♪ gentle, melancholy music playing]

Honey, the boy you saved
grew up to be such a gentleman.

00:28:04.246 --> 00:28:07.541
You did something really big
before you passed away.

00:28:07.624 --> 00:28:11.378
You saved a man
who'll be with Meri before leaving.

[Youngsook giggles]

00:28:14.006 --> 00:28:16.758

Have you been well?

What time is it in the US?

It's a bit past ten.

We just finished,
so we're cleaning up the hall.

I'm here at the columbarium
with your sister.

Say hello.

00:28:56.173 --> 00:29:00.260
Gosh, I wanted to go for the anniversary,
but it was hard to get time off.

Once our restaurant closes,
I'll come right away.

It's up to my boss.

Anyway, I'll come back to Korea soon,
so I'll see you there.

Oh, I haven't told Mom

that you're the grandson
of Myungsoondang's CEO.

00:32:13.995 --> 00:32:17.332
She's already worried
that your family might dislike me.

00:32:17.415 --> 00:32:19.668
So, I thought that might shock her.

00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:20.752
[chuckles softly]

00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:22.212
We can tell her later.

When I first heard it from Jingyeong,

00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:29.719
my mind totally went blank.

00:32:30.262 --> 00:32:32.222
But things are a bit clearer now.

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.017
I think...

00:32:37.352 --> 00:32:39.646
I'm going to tell Mr. Baek everything.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.066
If the winning gets canceled,

00:32:43.817 --> 00:32:46.444
I'm not sure what will happen.

00:32:47.946 --> 00:32:50.240
It might end with me
just returning the house.

00:32:50.907 --> 00:32:52.492
But in the worst case,

00:32:53.243 --> 00:32:54.577
I could be sued.

00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:57.330
Will you be okay?

00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:02.419
When I was abandoned with just the debt,

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.838
I felt really lost.

00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:09.301
At the time, I thought
that house was my last resort.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.888
But now, I have something more important.

00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:18.601
I want to stand tall in front of you.

00:33:19.352 --> 00:33:21.062

I'm going to work hard
and pay off my debt.

I know it's shameless for me to ask,

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.200
but could you wait for me a bit?

such a difficult decision.

No, I should thank you.

You gave me courage.

00:34:17.744 --> 00:34:20.205
[Miyeon sighs] I told you
to take Eungsoo with you.

00:34:20.914 --> 00:34:23.333
They'll probably need someone
at a director level for the US branch.

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:26.169
It would've been nice if he could've gone
to get a sense of things there.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.172
Why? Did Eungsoo ask
to be sent to the US branch?

00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:32.050
He's not the type to ask.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.387
He's too soft to have ambition.

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.139
That's why you need
to take care of him more.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:44.020
Lately, he has been learning English
from a private tutor.

00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:47.774
It's the speaking
that he has a problem with.

00:34:47.857 --> 00:34:49.109
His listening skills are okay.

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:51.861
That's not enough for the director level.

00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:55.031
What if Wooju beats him again?

00:34:56.074 --> 00:34:58.660
I'll take more care of Eungsoo, okay?

00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:01.287
[clicks tongue] Okay.

00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:04.040
When are you returning this time?

00:35:04.124 --> 00:35:06.209
Since next week is
the 80th anniversary ceremony,

00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:07.544
I'll be back before then.

[sighs wearily]

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.756
I'm so sick
of your business trips to the US.

I'll be back.

00:35:17.178 --> 00:35:18.346
Eungsoo!

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.765
Drive your dad to the airport!

00:35:21.725 --> 00:35:22.767
Okay.

00:35:23.435 --> 00:35:25.854
[sighs] I'm really okay.
The driver will be here soon.

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:27.021
[hums uncertainly]

00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:29.858
We only have a son.
You might as well make use of him.

00:35:29.941 --> 00:35:30.942
Don't you think so?

00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:32.736
Right.

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:34.112
Be quick, Eungsoo.

00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:35.196
Okay.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.364
-Let's go, Dad.
-Okay.

00:35:36.698 --> 00:35:37.907
-I'm off.
-Okay.

00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:52.255
About the plant in the US.

00:35:52.964 --> 00:35:54.382
If it's in the final stages,

00:35:54.466 --> 00:35:56.718
I guess your business trips
will lessen now.

00:35:58.094 --> 00:36:00.180
It's only the beginning. [sighs]

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:03.850
We've got to do the equipment test runs
before the first batch comes out,

00:36:03.933 --> 00:36:06.060
there's an OSHA audit coming up,

00:36:06.144 --> 00:36:07.645
and we need to stabilize the lines, too.

00:36:09.105 --> 00:36:11.107
[sighs wearily] In the end,
I have to be there.

00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:13.109
I see.

00:36:14.235 --> 00:36:16.488
When you're in the US,
please call Mom more often.

00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:18.823
She worries a lot
when she can't reach you.

00:36:19.449 --> 00:36:20.450
[chuckles softly]

00:36:20.533 --> 00:36:22.410
No news is good news.

00:36:22.494 --> 00:36:23.870
I get caught up with work,

00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:26.206
and the time difference
makes it hard to call. [chuckles softly]

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:27.499
[phone vibrates]

00:36:27.582 --> 00:36:28.792
[mistress] Are you free to call?

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.251
[♪ gripping, tense music playing]

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.255
[Hangu] I'm with Eungsoo right now.

00:36:34.339 --> 00:36:35.673
[mistress] What time's your flight?

00:36:35.757 --> 00:36:36.841
[Hangu] Three o'clock.

00:36:36.925 --> 00:36:38.051
I'll call you when I get there.

00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:43.097
You know, Mom really likes
the fig cookies from the duty-free shop.

00:36:43.598 --> 00:36:46.184
And there's a new pair of shoes
from M Kors' SS line.

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:50.146
They'd make great gifts for Mom
since it's your wedding anniversary soon.

00:36:51.397 --> 00:36:52.649
You know her shoe size, right?

00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:54.692
What?

00:36:55.401 --> 00:36:56.444
Mom's shoe size.

00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:58.446
Oh, what was it?

00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:01.407
It's 240mm.

00:37:01.866 --> 00:37:03.076
Okay, thanks.

00:37:22.387 --> 00:37:23.721
[grunts softly]

00:37:28.643 --> 00:37:29.644
Bye, then.

00:37:31.145 --> 00:37:32.146
Dad?

00:37:39.445 --> 00:37:40.572
Have a safe trip.

00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:44.284
Don't stay away for too long
since Mom's waiting.

00:37:47.537 --> 00:37:49.497
[♪ unsettling, tense music playing]

00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:58.006
[sighs nervously]

00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:06.389
[engages handbrake]

00:38:07.265 --> 00:38:08.266
We're here.

00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:10.727
Why are we here?

00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:12.395
[chuckles softly]

00:38:19.235 --> 00:38:20.820
[gasps in awe]

00:38:21.613 --> 00:38:24.699
These days,
they make the window frames slimmer.

00:38:24.782 --> 00:38:27.493
It shows off the view perfectly.

00:38:28.328 --> 00:38:30.872
Gosh, we need to renovate our house, too.

00:38:30.955 --> 00:38:32.498
We don't have money for that.

00:38:32.582 --> 00:38:34.042
Wooju is also unemployed now.

00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:36.294
Seriously, Mom!

00:38:36.377 --> 00:38:38.171
Why did you have to get ahead of yourself?

00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:40.465
He quit his job for nothing
because of you.

00:38:40.924 --> 00:38:43.134
How was I supposed to know
this would happen?

00:38:43.217 --> 00:38:44.427
[sighing wistfully]

00:38:44.761 --> 00:38:50.308
Only if Wooju could soften Jenny's heart
and make things work again.

00:38:50.725 --> 00:38:52.977
Just like me, he's too full of pride.

00:38:53.061 --> 00:38:54.062
Stop dreaming.

00:38:54.145 --> 00:38:55.772
Jenny is in the past now.

00:38:56.564 --> 00:38:59.776
Wooju wants Meri now, not Jenny.

00:38:59.859 --> 00:39:02.236
Didn't you see him crying
because he missed Meri?

00:39:03.029 --> 00:39:04.030
Meri?

00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:06.908
Don't even mention her.
It makes my blood pressure spike.

00:39:07.367 --> 00:39:10.244
-The name is now forbidden, okay?
-Fine.

00:39:10.328 --> 00:39:12.038
-[whispers] Meri.
-Oh, you!

00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.457
-That Meri...
-Wait for me!

00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:18.002
Ms. Chun.

00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:19.379
-Hurry up.
-What now?

00:39:19.462 --> 00:39:21.214
[♪ gripping, whimsical music playing]

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:25.551
This place is...

00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:27.053
-Is it your first time here?
-Yes.

00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.100
Your mother's kitchen
looked a little outdated.

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.644
I think it'd be nice to redo it for her.

00:39:34.727 --> 00:39:35.728
I see.

00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:37.647
I was thinking about it, too.

00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:40.650
I want to do it for her,
so could you help me?

00:39:40.733 --> 00:39:42.694
No, you don't have to.

00:39:42.777 --> 00:39:45.029
-I'll do it for her later--
-Ms. Yoo.

00:39:46.114 --> 00:39:48.199
Please let me do this for her.

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:55.540
[chuckles softly, inhales deeply]

00:39:55.623 --> 00:39:58.084
Now then, how about
something sleek and seamless,

00:39:58.167 --> 00:39:59.919
matched to your mom's height?

00:40:00.003 --> 00:40:01.129
Anything would do.

00:40:02.797 --> 00:40:04.007
[exclaims in amazement]

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.218
[Meri] This one's very spacious.

00:40:08.011 --> 00:40:09.012
[gasps]

00:40:09.095 --> 00:40:10.930
[♪ gripping, comical music playing]

00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:12.932
What are you doing?

00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:14.017
[shushes]

00:40:17.228 --> 00:40:18.229
Oh, my.

00:40:20.189 --> 00:40:21.691
Is that Meri?

00:40:21.774 --> 00:40:23.443
-[softly] Keep it down.
-[mouthing] Oh, right.

00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:26.195
I think it is.

00:40:26.279 --> 00:40:27.530
Who's that man?

00:40:27.613 --> 00:40:28.865
[Wooju's sister] I don't know.

00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:31.367
But he looks familiar.

00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:33.953
[Eunsook] Who was it?

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:36.831
Since you're here, I'll see myself out.

00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:37.915
My apologies.

00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:44.338
[gasps] Oh, my gosh.

00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:45.548
I can't believe this.

00:40:45.631 --> 00:40:47.800
That man... You know.

00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:49.218
[camera shutter clicks]

00:40:53.431 --> 00:40:54.432
[grunts softly]

00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:56.893
[beeps]

00:40:57.977 --> 00:40:59.103
[phone vibrates]

00:41:00.772 --> 00:41:03.191
[Wooju's sister] Isn't this the man
who was in your hospital room?

00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:05.359
There's definitely something going on
between him and Meri.

00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:10.406
[huffs]

00:41:12.617 --> 00:41:13.701
[scoffs]

00:41:13.785 --> 00:41:15.953
She said he was just
the client's team leader.

00:41:16.037 --> 00:41:17.413
[♪ gripping, dramatic music playing]

00:41:17.497 --> 00:41:21.250
No doubt he's the one who called Meri out
using his position as the client.

00:41:22.752 --> 00:41:24.337
Where does he work?

00:41:26.547 --> 00:41:27.590

KIM WOOJU, DO NOT ANSWER

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:39.560
My gosh.

00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.021
I almost answered.

00:41:42.105 --> 00:41:44.941
Good thing I didn't delete his number.

Geez.

00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:57.495
I need to know where he works
to send them an anonymous tip and ruin...

00:41:58.496 --> 00:42:01.040
[Wooju] I can't get a hold of Meri.
Do you know where she is right now?

00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:04.377
Oh, we had a small argument.

00:42:05.962 --> 00:42:08.339
You know. Just a lovers' quarrel.

00:42:08.464 --> 00:42:09.632
[Songhee acknowledges]

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:12.927
She's out on business right now,
so she might be hard to reach.

00:42:13.594 --> 00:42:15.638
There's been an incident at Myungsoondang.

00:42:16.013 --> 00:42:17.765
It's one of our clients.

00:42:17.849 --> 00:42:20.601
She's probably
with the team leader from there.

00:42:21.227 --> 00:42:22.687
Myungsoondang.

00:42:25.273 --> 00:42:28.484

Oh, Mr. Kim Wooju?

00:42:37.201 --> 00:42:39.453
He took a day off,
so he's not in the office today.

00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:42.165
Yes, he is our team leader.

00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:46.169
May I have your name, please?

00:42:48.796 --> 00:42:51.174
[Philnyun] Myungsoondang's spirit
of giving back to society

00:42:51.257 --> 00:42:54.427
began with our founder, my mother-in-law.

00:42:55.428 --> 00:42:57.722
Right after the Korean War,
it all began as a small bakery

00:42:57.805 --> 00:43:00.933
using just two sacks of flour
given by the US soldiers.

00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:06.230
And my mother-in-law would never sell
the steamed buns she made for the poor,

00:43:06.314 --> 00:43:08.900
even if a wealthy family offered
triple the price.

00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:13.529
Although we live in an age
full of tricks and deceit,

00:43:13.613 --> 00:43:16.908
Myungsoondang stands where it does today

00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:19.785
because of our belief
in creating honest, wholesome food.

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.335
Thank you for taking the time
for this interview.

00:43:27.418 --> 00:43:29.253
No, thank you.
[chuckles softly]

00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:32.381
Our 80th anniversary ceremony
is coming up soon.

00:43:32.465 --> 00:43:33.799
Please come by and have a meal.

00:43:33.883 --> 00:43:35.509
Okay.

00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:36.594
Bye, then.

00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:45.228
You must be tired.
You should go inside and rest.

00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:46.479
I'm okay.

00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:48.231
Since we're out,
let's check out the garden.

00:43:49.982 --> 00:43:52.109
[Miyeon] Mom!

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:54.028
[♪ dramatic, whimsical music playing]

[panting]

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.951
Mom, I'm here.

00:44:03.412 --> 00:44:04.538
Hi, Ms. Kim.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.936
Gosh, Mom.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.357
Why are you working
in the garden in this heat?

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:34.193
Mom, take a seat here.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.321
Mom.

00:44:37.405 --> 00:44:39.448
Should I apply some of this for you?

00:44:39.532 --> 00:44:41.784
If you have something to say,
spit it out already.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.830
Oh, it's nothing.

00:44:46.622 --> 00:44:48.666
It's just that people kept asking me.

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:49.750
Ask what?

00:44:52.211 --> 00:44:54.422
It's the 80th anniversary soon.

00:44:54.505 --> 00:44:58.509
So, whether you'll be announcing
your successor at the ceremony

00:44:58.592 --> 00:45:00.928
is what everyone's been wondering.

00:45:01.012 --> 00:45:02.346
You're the one who's curious.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.806
Of course, I'm curious

00:45:04.348 --> 00:45:06.225
since my Eungsoo is also in the line.

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:09.645
I'll leave it to someone qualified,
so stay out of it.

00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:13.190
How can I stay out of it
when the playing field's tilted?

00:45:15.401 --> 00:45:16.569
Since I was little,

00:45:16.652 --> 00:45:19.405
you've always favored my brother
and treated me like an afterthought.

00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:22.867
That same pattern's been passed down
to Wooju and Eungsoo.

00:45:23.617 --> 00:45:24.952
How could I not feel uneasy?

00:45:26.287 --> 00:45:28.122
When did I ever treat you
like an afterthought?

00:45:28.748 --> 00:45:31.542
You always praised my brother
and didn't trust me with anything.

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:33.586
Our household was sexist,

00:45:33.669 --> 00:45:35.129
and its preference for sons

00:45:35.963 --> 00:45:37.381
was really strong.

00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:39.759
You have no right to say that.

00:45:39.842 --> 00:45:41.469
It wasn't sexism.

00:45:41.552 --> 00:45:43.095
You received horrible grades.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.474
Your tuition fee cost us more.

00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:49.393
You had no perseverance,
so you'd always quit halfway.

00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:51.103
And you are so gullible.

00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:52.188
So, how could I trust you?

00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:55.483
It's not my fault that I'm not so smart.

00:45:55.566 --> 00:45:59.111
You're partly to blame
for my double-digit IQ, Mom.

00:45:59.195 --> 00:46:01.197
It's all part of the genetics.

00:46:02.656 --> 00:46:06.452
That's why I don't scold Eungsoo
for not being book smart.

00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:08.454
I just say it's my fault.

00:46:08.537 --> 00:46:09.622
Oh, my.

00:46:10.331 --> 00:46:12.917
Sure, it's all my fault.

00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:15.336
I'm sorry. Happy, now?

00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:18.422
Where are you going, Mom?

00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:20.007
I'm heading in because I can't stand you.

00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:21.092
I have a headache now.

[♪ dramatic, tense music playing]

00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:29.809
Mom,

00:46:30.434 --> 00:46:33.562
your perfectly fine head gets a headache
every time we talk, doesn't it?

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.816
You never listen until the end
and always dismiss me.

00:46:37.817 --> 00:46:38.859
Fine.

00:46:38.943 --> 00:46:40.653
I'm okay with you treating me that way.

00:46:40.736 --> 00:46:44.115
But if you're like that
to my husband and my son,

00:46:44.198 --> 00:46:45.616
I won't stand it.

00:46:45.699 --> 00:46:46.700
I'm not all talk.

00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:52.039
I'll make you regret how you mistreated
my husband and my son.

00:46:52.123 --> 00:46:53.165
Just watch me.

00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:54.625

What about Henry?

He's asleep.

00:47:28.701 --> 00:47:31.120
He's out cold after his ice hockey lesson.

00:47:32.121 --> 00:47:34.165
I know it's a bit early for the champagne,

00:47:34.248 --> 00:47:37.251
but a single sip won't hurt
since we're so close to the end.

00:47:47.595 --> 00:47:49.388
Still, don't let your guard down.

00:47:49.472 --> 00:47:53.100
You know what Chairwoman Ko is like
since you've worked under her before.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.853
All right.

00:47:57.229 --> 00:47:58.689
I've waited this far.

00:47:59.273 --> 00:48:01.150
I can hang on a little longer.

00:48:02.151 --> 00:48:03.194

This is nice.

Oh, right.

00:48:12.077 --> 00:48:15.372
I had J Consulting dissolved
and wiped out all traces.

00:48:15.456 --> 00:48:18.417
And I transferred the money
to your Swiss account.

00:48:20.002 --> 00:48:21.128
Good work.

00:48:21.212 --> 00:48:22.630
You haven't lost your touch.

[chuckles softly]

00:48:24.757 --> 00:48:28.844
Anyway, you said Ms. Kim
is looking into J Consulting.

00:48:29.428 --> 00:48:30.429
Do you think

00:48:30.513 --> 00:48:33.265
they realized it's tied
to the private equity fund?

00:48:34.642 --> 00:48:37.102
If so, it wouldn't be so peaceful still.

00:48:37.186 --> 00:48:39.480
Even if they did, it's too late now.

00:48:39.563 --> 00:48:41.440
There's nothing they can do.

[hums thoughtfully]

I can't wait to see
Chairwoman Ko's reaction.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.157
If she found out the private equity fund
that financed the US plant was yours,

00:48:50.241 --> 00:48:51.659
what face do you think she'd pull?

The son-in-law she bossed around

But for me,

00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:02.628
I'm more curious about Miyeon's reaction.

00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:04.171
Why her?

00:49:04.255 --> 00:49:07.341
That woman invested
her father's inheritance

00:49:07.424 --> 00:49:10.010
in a Hawaii hotel
and lost every penny of it.

00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:12.555
If she finds out that was your doing...

Can we talk separately?

You shouldn't be so pretty then.

From now on,

00:50:06.609 --> 00:50:09.111
don't show up too pretty
when you come for the meetings.

00:50:09.194 --> 00:50:10.362

Stop texting me during the meetings.

I'm nervous we'll be caught.

00:50:14.908 --> 00:50:18.329
[Wonseok] We made sure it clearly conveys
a sense of premium and gift value.

00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:20.748
Next, the product features
a single material

00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:22.791
that's water-based and plant-derived...

00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:24.335

[Wonseok] ...with enhanced
eco-friendly standards.

We used internal QR printing
and personalization

to transform the unboxing
into a storytelling journey.

00:50:31.759 --> 00:50:34.094
The next challenge we needed to address

00:50:34.595 --> 00:50:36.722
-was that the previous packaging...
-[phone vibrates]

00:50:36.805 --> 00:50:38.557
...had its limits
in terms of luxury and finish,

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.893
which made it somewhat
inconsistent as a gift set.

00:50:40.976 --> 00:50:42.895
[Kim Wooju] Let's have lunch together
after this.

00:50:42.978 --> 00:50:43.979
Just the two of us.

00:50:44.063 --> 00:50:46.357
[Wonseok] It was also difficult
to reflect the campaign message.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.150
We also received feedback

00:50:48.233 --> 00:50:51.820
that the excessive packaging
lessened the eco-friendly impression.

00:50:52.321 --> 00:50:54.156
So, why didn't you reply to them?

00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:55.324
How could I?

About 9 or 10 years ago,

Every year during the holidays,

there's an orphanage
that our company visits.

00:59:45.145 --> 00:59:48.315
It's our annual event to go there
and make dumplings to eat together.

We make a large batch
so they can freeze some for later.

00:59:51.902 --> 00:59:53.403
But because it's a lot of work,

00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:56.615
I was going to make a few by hand
and buy the rest from a shop.

Still, they were delicious.

In cooking, sincerity is everything.

So, you've got to be honest
from the start.

you can't lie to them,

when they're store-bought.

Once you start lying,
it's easy to lie again.

A one-time cheater can easily turn
into a career criminal.

Maybe it's because
I'm in the food business,

more than anything.

in the marriage talks with Mr. Kim?

01:02:55.043 --> 01:02:57.212
[Wonseok inhales deeply] I'm not sure.

01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:59.464
She does seem like the one.

01:02:59.547 --> 01:03:00.715
What's this about?

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:02.675
[chuckles, inhales deeply]

01:03:02.759 --> 01:03:03.802
Are you curious?

Tell me now.

01:03:05.345 --> 01:03:07.806
It's about Mr. Kim.

01:03:08.264 --> 01:03:10.308
They say there's
a marriage talk between him

01:03:10.391 --> 01:03:12.560
and the chairwoman's doctor's daughter.

01:03:12.644 --> 01:03:13.812
[Ms. Oh] Really?

01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:16.106
Why are you telling me this now?

01:03:16.189 --> 01:03:17.690
Because you didn't ask.

01:03:17.774 --> 01:03:19.317
-You startled me.
-[Ms. Oh] Seriously.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.236
I should've gotten a closer look at her.

01:03:22.403 --> 01:03:23.571
She was pretty.

01:03:24.364 --> 01:03:27.200
[Wonseok] She's the hospital director's
daughter, and she's a doctor herself.

01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:29.452
Apparently, the chairwoman
really dotes on her.

-[Ms. Oh] Really?
-[Wonseok] Yes.

[machine beeping]

I wouldn't have called if I'd known
Director Yoon was away at the conference.

Sorry to bother you.

It's nothing.

to take good care of you.

I keep dreaming about my late husband.

01:04:05.196 --> 01:04:06.698
It's really disturbing.

01:04:07.365 --> 01:04:09.576
Grandma, I think
that's a lottery-winning dream.

the winning number.

It's not like I'm going
to take it to my grave.

01:04:23.631 --> 01:04:26.384
I'll be satisfied if I can see Wooju
get married before I go.

01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.763
Are things going well with Wooju?

01:04:44.444 --> 01:04:45.987
I've been thinking.

01:04:46.738 --> 01:04:48.031
I think I like Wooju more

01:04:49.741 --> 01:04:53.077
as a brother than as a boyfriend.

01:05:17.518 --> 01:05:18.561
[sighs wearily]

01:05:21.648 --> 01:05:26.402
[realtor] Hello, everyone!
Today, I'm here at Beauté Palace.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.781
The pre-sale price here
used to be under three million dollars,

01:05:29.864 --> 01:05:32.742
but recently, prices have hit the roof.

01:05:32.825 --> 01:05:35.787
So, the latest deals are
at least five million dollars.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.121
[gasps in awe]

01:05:37.205 --> 01:05:39.916
Oh, and apparently,
Beauté Department Store

01:05:39.999 --> 01:05:44.212
even gave away one of these units
as a prize for newlyweds.

01:05:44.295 --> 01:05:45.588
Five million dollars?

01:05:45.672 --> 01:05:47.423
-But honestly, that's just a dream
-Really?

01:05:47.507 --> 01:05:48.800
for people like us.

01:05:48.883 --> 01:05:51.135
I understand
if it's for five million dollars.

01:05:52.178 --> 01:05:53.888
[realtor] But as you can see here,

01:05:53.972 --> 01:05:55.890
it's decorated with flowers
and a European touch...

01:05:55.974 --> 01:05:57.392
Are you just going to stay home?

01:05:57.475 --> 01:05:58.685
Aren't you going to get a job?

01:05:59.394 --> 01:06:00.395
[sighs in exasperation]

01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:03.147
[Eunsook sighs]

01:06:04.107 --> 01:06:05.775
This is a medical report
from the hospital.

01:06:05.858 --> 01:06:06.985
Send it to the insurance.

01:06:07.068 --> 01:06:09.487
[Wooju whining] The insurance payout
isn't even that much!

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:10.947
I put you down for a lot of them.

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:12.907
For the ones I paid for, bring them to me.

01:06:12.991 --> 01:06:14.367
Fine!

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:17.328
I'll get the insurance payout.
You can keep them all!

You broke off the engagement.

01:06:27.255 --> 01:06:29.173
Why are you taking it out on me?

01:06:29.924 --> 01:06:32.010
Mom, try to be more understanding.

01:06:32.093 --> 01:06:33.845
He's having a complete mental breakdown.

01:06:34.429 --> 01:06:36.347
He got dumped by Jenny.

01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:39.100
Meri got herself a boyfriend.
[tsk-tsk]

01:06:39.225 --> 01:06:41.811
I bet it stings even more
because he trusted her.

01:06:41.894 --> 01:06:45.148
Meri really has no principles, does she?

01:06:45.231 --> 01:06:46.524
It hasn't even been that long.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.776
I've been thinking about it,

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.113
and I think when she came to our house,
she was already seeing someone else.

01:06:52.196 --> 01:06:54.532
She was that confident
because she had someone to fall back on.

01:06:55.033 --> 01:06:58.036
I'm going to see
just how great this guy she's dating is.

01:06:58.119 --> 01:06:59.329
He seemed great.

01:07:00.038 --> 01:07:01.080
You've got to admit,

01:07:01.164 --> 01:07:03.458
Meri has good luck with guys, right?

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:04.834
She does not.

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:06.586
Where are you going?

01:07:07.712 --> 01:07:11.424
With Wooju like that,
I should at least snag myself a man.

Yes.

Really?

01:07:33.279 --> 01:07:35.031

The insurance beneficiary is Yoo Meri?

[adjuster] Yes, the insured is listed
as Mr. Kim Wooju,

but both the policyholder

But we're no longer together
because we're divorced.

So, I need to change the beneficiary.

[adjuster] Oh, is that so?

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:52.233
In that case,

with the divorce date indicated.

01:08:54.277 --> 01:08:56.070
