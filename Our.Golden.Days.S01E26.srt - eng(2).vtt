All done.

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.268
That's it?

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:19.538
Yes.

Mom.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.758
Eun Oh. You said you weren't going to the site today.

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:14.058
- Come to the restaurant now. - Why?

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:15.898
Gang Oh's gotten himself into trouble.

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:22.768
- He emailed the head office? - Yes.

Now, they're saying they want to come and try my galbi.

00:01:28.308 --> 00:01:29.438
What do you mean they want to try it?

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:31.948
They were working on a new menu item.

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:33.948
If they like it, they'll consider it.

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:36.748
Really?

See? I did good, right?

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:48.258
You just went and made more work for us.

00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:50.358
It only tastes good to us.

00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:53.898

Mom, I'm sorry.

What's gotten into you? Do you want a piggyback?

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:12.688
- Let me give you a piggyback ride. - No, Mom.

00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:13.948

What, are you that touched?

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:49.588
If you get this emotional from a hug from your own brother,

It's nothing. I just got dizzy for a moment.

Anyway, I have that construction job tomorrow,

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.708
and I have some prep work to do, so I should probably get going.

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:11.908

I really shouldn't have.

It's fine. They won't contact me.

00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:35.768
- You? - No, nothing.

Mr. Jo. What if the acquisition fails?

00:03:45.578 --> 00:03:47.578
I guess we'll move ahead with the showroom?

00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:49.548
We would, right, Ms. Ji?

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:51.978
Yes, I think so.

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:54.048
- That was the plan, after all. - Yes.

00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:59.028
Today's the day they announce the preliminary bidding results.

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.058

agreed to the decision to go after AP.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:13.408
But if we go back to the original plan,

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:16.738
there's no guarantee they'll stay on board.

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.908
What happens if they pull out?

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:23.918
If we lose all the investment money,

our operating costs and new hire salaries...

00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:31.058

- Hello? - Mr. Lee.

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:58.678
We passed the AP Group preliminary bid.

00:04:59.588 --> 00:05:00.718
We did?

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:04.658
Okay, I'll call you back in a bit. All right.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:08.128
We've been officially shortlisted for the AP Group acquisition.

00:05:08.488 --> 00:05:10.428
- Really? - Yes.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:14.698
That was no easy feat, but we finally made it.

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:17.198
I got lucky with a great partner and team.

00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:22.638
We're lucky to have you too. A CEO's appeal is key to funding.

all talk about your sincerity and passion, Mr. Lee.

00:05:30.278 --> 00:05:32.388
You're just reaping what you've sown.

00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:35.088
It's truly impressive.

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:37.258
I got lucky with Boyang Construction.

00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:40.258
You said six teams made it to the preliminary bid, right?

00:05:40.358 --> 00:05:43.498
Rumiko and Yeongsin Paper are the strongest contenders.

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:46.198
Both companies are very determined to acquire AP,

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:48.768
and I hear they've already secured the funds.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.308
Still, you never know who will win until the race is over.

You, my humble heart

00:06:37.778 --> 00:06:39.818
What's she always so happy about?

00:06:40.248 --> 00:06:42.358
- She must've grown up spoiled. - Who?

00:06:43.118 --> 00:06:44.118
Ji Eun Oh?

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:45.628
Yes.

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.658
She looks like she doesn't have a care in the world.

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:50.758
For the past two months, ever since club recruitment,

00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:53.468
- she's been all smiles. - Not at all, man.

00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:57.468
I've only seen her eat cafeteria food once a semester.

00:06:57.698 --> 00:06:58.908
She always eats convenience store food.

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:01.268
She's always working two tutoring jobs.

00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:02.608
She must be the family's breadwinner.

00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:06.878
But what about the volunteer event? She brought dozens of sandwiches.

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:09.048
She made those herself.

00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:11.748
- With her own money? - Yes.

00:07:11.818 --> 00:07:14.188
- Ever since I met you - But...

00:07:14.188 --> 00:07:15.518
you said she was the family's breadwinner.

00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:19.588
I don't know. That's just who Ji Eun Oh is. Yes.

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:21.028
Nobody's perfect

00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:22.158
She's a weird one.

00:07:22.828 --> 00:07:27.298
Look at me, I'm a wrecked mess

00:07:27.498 --> 00:07:31.368
But I feel like I've been born again

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:35.538
Ever since I met you

00:07:35.908 --> 00:07:38.038
You, my humble heart

00:07:38.038 --> 00:07:39.148
Gosh, you scared me!

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:44.148
Hey, why are you doing that?

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:45.818
You're the turnkey team lead.

00:07:46.088 --> 00:07:48.218
Everyone has a different role depending on their position,

00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:49.858
so why are you doing a labourer's work?

00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:52.628
See, that's your problem.

00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:54.628
You're always too quick to judge.

00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:56.428
I'm having fun.

00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:57.828
I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:00.228
Come on, how can this be fun? It's hard work.

00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:02.338
I'm doing it because the details are important.

00:08:02.638 --> 00:08:03.868
It's not like I'm fixing a defect.

00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:05.868
For a job I'm passionate about,

00:08:06.408 --> 00:08:08.238
I'm just adding the finishing touches.

00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:12.348
So you enjoy getting on your knees and oiling the floors?

00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:15.548
Then, Ji Hyuk,

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:17.978
why did you take on the AP Group acquisition?

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.718
Everyone says you're fighting a losing battle.

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:24.158
And yet, you're trying to pull off this massive, impossible feat.

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:26.828
Aren't you just doing it for the thrill?

00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:29.858
What lunatic would buy a company for the thrill of it?

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:31.328
What I mean is,

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:33.028
business...

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.568
isn't always just about making money.

00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:40.108
You've got a point there.

00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:45.408
But...

00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:47.878
for a guy who's busy day and night trying to secure investors,

00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:49.948
how did you find the time to come here?

00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:54.048
I won the preliminary bid.

00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.628
You're kidding! Wow, how did you pull that off?

00:09:01.088 --> 00:09:03.458
When I set my mind to something, I get it done.

00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.628
Listen to you brag.

00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:10.068
Couldn't you just say, "I guess I got lucky?"

00:09:10.198 --> 00:09:11.698
There's no such thing as luck in this world.

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:16.338
You met my eyes as I stood at the wedding altar.

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.278
How can you even talk about luck?

00:09:23.818 --> 00:09:25.848
Whatever luck I had left in my life,

00:09:26.288 --> 00:09:27.588
I'm pretty sure it all ran out that day.

00:09:29.018 --> 00:09:31.018
You're finally acting like the old Ji Hyuk again.

00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:34.358
Saying whatever's on your mind, no filter.

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.728
Right. Did you do the DNA registration?

00:09:39.428 --> 00:09:41.868
- I did. - See? Aren't you glad you listened?

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:44.198
I can be useful to you sometimes.

00:09:45.338 --> 00:09:46.808
I was going to do it anyway.

00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:51.278
And that song you always hum when you're excited...

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:52.778
You've been singing the lyrics wrong.

00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:55.108
That's just because I haven't sung it in a while.

00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:57.818
No, you've had it wrong ever since your second year of college.

00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:01.248
Look at me, I'm a wrecked mess

00:10:01.248 --> 00:10:02.318
That's not how it goes.

00:10:02.688 --> 00:10:05.288
Look at me, I'm a lonely mess

00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:06.358
That's the correct version.

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:10.858
Look at me, I'm a lonely mess

00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:14.198
Why are you just telling me now?

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:15.728
Because I found you annoying.

00:10:17.438 --> 00:10:18.438
Back in college?

00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:20.108
Why? What did I do?

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.178
Back then, you were cute. Now, you're just too slick.

00:10:23.878 --> 00:10:24.878
It's a little disappointing.

00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:26.648
Shoot.

00:10:26.908 --> 00:10:28.748
Gosh, I've got two investor meetings to get to.

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:30.978
Hey, I have to go. Take it easy, okay?

00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:31.978
Wait...

00:10:35.418 --> 00:10:37.088
He came all this way even though he's so busy.

00:10:38.358 --> 00:10:41.028
It's nice to see him acting like his old self again.

00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:43.628
You made the right call, Ji Hyuk.

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:47.898
(Gaon Foundation)

00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:53.968
I trust nothing has been omitted or embellished here?

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:57.378
- The information is solid, then. - Of course, ma'am.

00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:01.248
I've been networking in high society for 30 years.

00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:04.278
All right, first...

00:11:05.218 --> 00:11:06.618
Let's start with this one.

00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:10.088
But, ma'am.

00:11:10.618 --> 00:11:13.258
Your son is so handsome and tall.

00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:16.028
The youngest daughter of the Haena Group family,

00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:19.298
who met him in the US, seems to be interested in him.

00:11:19.668 --> 00:11:21.928
Why did you turn her down?

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:24.568
She's the daughter of the second wife.

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:28.708
His first wife passed away, and he remarried.

00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:31.778
Besides, Director Park has been married before.

00:11:32.278 --> 00:11:35.508
I'd rank her higher than these other girls.

00:11:36.648 --> 00:11:38.818
She was his illegitimate daughter...

00:11:38.818 --> 00:11:40.748
until the first wife's accidental death.

00:11:40.888 --> 00:11:42.588
But still, it's Haena Group.

00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:49.228
Never mind.

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.898
And as for my son...

00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:55.498
This is technically his first marriage.

00:11:57.098 --> 00:11:59.608
He was just duped by a gold digger.

00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:02.468
Gosh, it's so upsetting to even think about.

00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:25.758
(Mom's Car)

00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:28.598
There we go.

00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.268
(Mom's Car)

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.568
Take my heart.

00:12:40.778 --> 00:12:42.548
Hey, this is so cool.

00:12:42.548 --> 00:12:44.548
Mom's car is lit up at the foundation.

00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:47.618
Gosh, I thought my heart was going to pound out of my chest.

00:12:48.218 --> 00:12:51.188
Let's get out of here. I'm starving. Waiting for you was brutal.

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:53.988
- Got anything in mind? - Chicken and beer by the Han River.

00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:56.598
The Han River? No, we can't go all the way there.

00:12:56.728 --> 00:12:58.258
We need to ease into it.

00:12:59.228 --> 00:13:00.228
You think so?

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.168
Today, let's just go to the park right here.

00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:05.068
Okay.

00:13:14.078 --> 00:13:15.078
Say something.

00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:18.748
- Cheers. - No, not that.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:21.618
Today you pulled off something like a jailbreak.

00:13:21.818 --> 00:13:24.158
Sum up how you feel right now in one phrase.

00:13:28.758 --> 00:13:30.328
Let's do it again, the jailbreak.

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.798
Sounds good. Let's do it again!

00:13:33.398 --> 00:13:34.398
Cheers.

00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:39.868
Hey.

00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:44.638
This is so good!

00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:48.808
Yeong Ra, why are you chugging? You've barely had a drink before.

00:13:49.108 --> 00:13:50.878
What if it hits you all at once and you get wasted?

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:52.688
- I won't get drunk. - Why not?

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:54.918
After starting grad school last year,

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.488
we went out for drinks with our professor on Teachers' Day.

00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.328
And he was a huge drinker,

00:14:00.888 --> 00:14:02.158
but I was the only one left standing.

00:14:02.698 --> 00:14:04.458
So how much did you drink?

00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:07.728
Like, a bottle of wine?

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:14.738
(Delicious food has zero calories.)

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.438
All right, we're done eating. Let's head in.

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.778
But wait. Mom is still at the foundation.

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:28.148
Come on.

00:14:29.788 --> 00:14:30.788
Fine.

00:14:33.128 --> 00:14:34.488
I'm so happy.

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:36.158
So this is what it feels like.

00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:39.368
Hey, you call this happiness?

00:14:57.548 --> 00:15:00.518
This is my favourite song.

00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:14.028
It's a nice song.

00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:45.198
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:56.278
Eun Oh, hold my hand.

00:15:56.838 --> 00:15:58.078
I'm shaking all over.

00:15:59.748 --> 00:16:00.808
Did you make this or something?

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:03.718
Why are you so nervous? They're not judging your food.

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:06.688
It's pretty good.

00:16:14.088 --> 00:16:15.158
- Come here. - Mother.

00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:18.198
What's all this about?

00:16:20.598 --> 00:16:21.598
My dear.

00:16:22.968 --> 00:16:25.938
I'm talking about your father.

00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:30.438
Let's have him move in here and live with us.

00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:32.278
What?

00:16:33.578 --> 00:16:35.248
Now that I think about it,

00:16:36.108 --> 00:16:37.418
it's just too...

00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:42.418
What's the word? Unfair. Yes, it's so unfair.

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:45.958
Using your father-in-law's illness as an excuse,

00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:49.498
I've been living with you all for over 15 years.

00:16:50.658 --> 00:16:54.998
I get to live with my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren,

00:16:55.998 --> 00:17:00.808
so it makes no sense for your father to be living all alone.

00:17:01.408 --> 00:17:02.408
But, Mother...

00:17:03.038 --> 00:17:06.078
Where would my father even stay?

00:17:06.848 --> 00:17:08.878
He can have my room.

00:17:09.248 --> 00:17:11.148
I'll share a room with Su Bin.

00:17:12.988 --> 00:17:15.448
Su Bin's hardly ever home anyway,

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:19.488
and I'm out during the day for my part-time job.

00:17:20.828 --> 00:17:24.228
Mother, how could you even think of that?

00:17:24.828 --> 00:17:27.698
It's just the right thing to do.

00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:31.238
I even thought about moving out myself.

00:17:31.568 --> 00:17:33.068
You know, to switch places with him.

00:17:34.108 --> 00:17:36.908
But you wouldn't let that happen, would you?

00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:40.808
So let's all just live together.

00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:46.618
This is all happening because your father and I...

00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:49.818
didn't pass on when we should have.

00:17:52.758 --> 00:17:54.688
Let me think about it, Mother.

00:17:58.898 --> 00:18:02.128
I really appreciate you saying that.

00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:06.808
Come on. There's nothing to thank me for.

00:18:16.248 --> 00:18:17.278
Dad.

00:18:17.678 --> 00:18:18.678
Hey.

00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:20.818
What brings you here?

00:18:21.688 --> 00:18:23.818
Dad, we need to talk.

00:18:25.718 --> 00:18:26.958
Oh, no. This can't be good.

00:18:27.528 --> 00:18:28.658
This is not good.

00:18:29.728 --> 00:18:31.858
What is it? What's this about?

00:18:32.698 --> 00:18:36.498
You haven't told Mom, have you? About me trying to acquire AP Group.

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:38.938
Is that what this is about?

00:18:39.498 --> 00:18:42.308
Yes. I was hoping you hadn't told the family...

00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:45.278
Wait, have you already told them?

00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:49.078
Come on, it's not like it's a huge secret.

00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:52.848
Whether it works out or not, the family deserves to know.

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:55.348
But they'll just worry if they know.

00:18:56.148 --> 00:18:58.018
Then why do something that makes us worry?

00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:01.188
Whether it's cause for worry, or a good thing,

00:19:01.588 --> 00:19:02.688
we just don't know yet.

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:04.458
What?

00:19:05.258 --> 00:19:06.628
This might not work out.

00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:10.138
If this doesn't work, I'm the one who has to fix it and live with it.

00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:14.768
Why tell everyone so they'll worry? This is my burden to bear.

00:19:15.268 --> 00:19:16.378
Your burden to bear?

00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:18.578
Yes. It's mine.

00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:23.278
So, is there nothing I can do to help?

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:24.848
Acquiring a company like that...

00:19:24.848 --> 00:19:26.848
It costs a fortune, you know.

00:19:27.348 --> 00:19:29.388
It's fine. It's going well.

00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:37.798
I swear... Unbelievable.

00:19:38.758 --> 00:19:39.968
"It's going well?" So, that's it?

00:19:40.668 --> 00:19:44.138
How dare he try to boss me around? I taught him better than that.

00:19:44.298 --> 00:19:45.338
What a brat.

00:19:45.538 --> 00:19:48.268
I'd take him to the bathhouse as a kid and scrub his back.

00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:50.908
And I'd tell him, "A man has to be tight-lipped."

00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:54.548
"Even when things get tough, you don't run to Mom or Grandma."

00:19:54.678 --> 00:19:56.578
I'm the one who taught him that.

00:19:56.978 --> 00:19:58.378
And now, with something this important,

00:19:58.378 --> 00:20:00.188
he's gagging me because he's afraid I'll talk?

00:20:00.848 --> 00:20:03.358
That rotten kid! The nerve of him.

00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:05.618
How dare he try to gag me? That little...

00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:11.798
You're not on the phone?

00:20:12.698 --> 00:20:14.698
Why are you arguing with yourself?

00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:16.968
It's nothing.

00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:26.708
It's done.

00:20:26.978 --> 00:20:29.718
- Done! - Dad!

00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:31.078
- What? What is it? - Dad.

00:20:31.518 --> 00:20:33.688
I heard his acquisition failed.

00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:35.218
What?

00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:36.688
It failed?

00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:39.188
Ji Hyuk's company went bankrupt because of it!

00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:40.928
- What? - What do we do now?

00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:44.058
No, Ji Hyuk...

00:20:44.498 --> 00:20:45.498
Ji Hyuk!

00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.498
No, Ji Hyuk. No.

00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:50.368
- No, Ji Hyuk... - Honey.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.338
Honey, Ji Hyuk...

00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:58.238
What dream had you calling Ji Hyuk and yelling, "No?"

00:20:59.778 --> 00:21:02.378
It was nothing. Just a stupid nightmare.

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:13.428
We are at the due diligence stage, Mr. Lee.

00:21:14.088 --> 00:21:16.058
- Let's head in. - Yes.

00:21:17.298 --> 00:21:19.798
For the past 30 years, AP Group...

00:21:20.068 --> 00:21:22.768
has steadily built its expertise and technological prowess.

00:21:23.568 --> 00:21:25.968
We are seeking a new leader to uphold AP's spirit and vision...

00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:29.408
and guide the company in step with the changing times.

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:36.578
Hong Jong Chan, CEO of Yeongsin Paper.

00:21:36.948 --> 00:21:41.148
With the current economic downturn, it seems AP's growth has stalled.

00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:44.788
- Is it the real reason for selling? - As you all know, this sale...

00:21:45.058 --> 00:21:47.358
is due to a lack of a clear successor.

00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:49.358
It has nothing to do with our business performance.

00:21:51.998 --> 00:21:54.868
- Yes, go ahead. - Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO of Mamdaerozip.

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:57.698
You mentioned a transition from B2B to B2C.

00:21:57.898 --> 00:22:01.338
Are you developing any services for direct consumer engagement?

00:22:01.568 --> 00:22:04.678
Yes. We have several projects underway.

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:06.908
Our online division is partially...

00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:11.978
- It's pretty heated, isn't it? - Yes, more intense than I thought.

00:22:12.318 --> 00:22:14.748
Gosh, he's just a kid.

00:22:17.118 --> 00:22:18.758
Did they just let him in for the experience?

00:22:19.618 --> 00:22:21.328
AP just got his hopes up for nothing.

00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:26.428
- Let's go, Mr. Lee. - Yes.

00:22:26.528 --> 00:22:28.828
Oh, Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk, the CEO of Mamdaerozip.

00:22:29.528 --> 00:22:32.738
Thanks to you, this bidding war just got a lot more entertaining.

00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:36.268
- I'm glad you're enjoying it. - Yes, but...

00:22:36.738 --> 00:22:39.378
Seriously, do you even have the money for this?

00:22:40.608 --> 00:22:43.008
Your company is still so new.

00:22:43.818 --> 00:22:45.078
The only difference is on paper.

00:22:52.388 --> 00:22:54.688
What I don't get is AP.

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.258
They should've picked a company with actual financial backing.

00:22:57.858 --> 00:22:59.728
He says the only difference is on paper.

00:22:59.828 --> 00:23:02.698
Hey, I hear Boyang Construction is backing him.

00:23:04.598 --> 00:23:05.798
Boyang Construction?

00:23:05.898 --> 00:23:10.138
They say Boyang Construction invested ten million dollars.

00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:15.848
(A dream about your son going bankrupt)

00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:18.148
(What's the meaning of a dream about your son going bankrupt?)

00:23:19.178 --> 00:23:20.488
This might not work out.

00:23:21.318 --> 00:23:24.058
If this doesn't work, I'm the one who has to fix it and live with it.

00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:27.588
Why tell everyone so they'll worry? This is my burden to bear.

00:23:28.088 --> 00:23:30.458
Yes, right. There's no way he can pull it off.

00:23:30.898 --> 00:23:35.098
He thinks he can raise the money to buy that huge company by himself?

00:23:35.798 --> 00:23:36.798
Goodness.

00:23:37.098 --> 00:23:39.268
Even when he's struggling, he can't ask for help...

00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:41.438
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:45.978
(Jinan Bank)

00:23:50.578 --> 00:23:53.518
That's right. He has parents.

00:23:54.388 --> 00:23:56.958
Come on, kid. You've got a father.

00:24:02.188 --> 00:24:06.228
So, I should just help the customers try it out when they come in, right?

00:24:06.258 --> 00:24:09.938
Yes, it's important for them to experience our products directly.

00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:13.868
Let me show you how to use this heated mat.

00:24:14.008 --> 00:24:16.678
Hold on. Let me just jot this down in the notes app...

00:24:17.538 --> 00:24:19.178
Just a second.

00:24:22.808 --> 00:24:23.948
Honey? What is it?

00:24:24.518 --> 00:24:29.048
I wasn't well, so I came home early, but you weren't here.

00:24:29.688 --> 00:24:32.488
I'm just out with a friend nearby.

00:24:33.188 --> 00:24:34.588
Are you feeling really sick?

00:24:35.288 --> 00:24:38.098
Oh, no. It's just a little indigestion.

00:24:38.198 --> 00:24:40.998
Don't rush back on my account. Stay and have fun. Okay?

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:53.678
I'm sorry. We can't approve a home equity loan.

00:24:53.748 --> 00:24:56.348
You're currently unemployed and have other outstanding loans.

00:24:57.378 --> 00:25:00.348
That's ridiculous! I need the money now.

00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:03.048
Why can't I get a loan against my own house?

00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:07.388
(Severance Pay for Living Expenses)

00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:16.898
(Youth and Rock)

00:25:18.568 --> 00:25:20.168
We're not open yet.

00:25:20.768 --> 00:25:22.138
Wait, Da Jeong?

00:25:22.768 --> 00:25:23.778
It's been a while.

00:25:24.178 --> 00:25:25.178
Da Jeong!

00:25:25.778 --> 00:25:28.378
We live in the same neighbourhood, but I haven't seen you in ages.

00:25:28.578 --> 00:25:30.918
I came to see Sin Yeong today.

00:25:31.648 --> 00:25:33.418
Something must be wrong at home.

00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:35.688
Can you have a beer with me?

00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:38.458
About me being here today...

00:25:38.518 --> 00:25:41.628
Right. Not a word to Sang Cheol. It's a secret.

00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:43.188
Here, have a seat.

00:25:50.198 --> 00:25:54.908
- Depression is common in seniors. - The truth is, all this time,

00:25:55.468 --> 00:25:57.608
a part of me resented him.

00:25:58.538 --> 00:26:03.148
My father-in-law had a boat accident after Ji Hyuk's first birthday.

00:26:03.648 --> 00:26:08.048
After that, he couldn't keep a job and just started drinking.

00:26:08.888 --> 00:26:11.718
My mother-in-law had to care for him and earn all the money.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.728
Lung damage, pleurisy,

00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:17.898
high blood pressure, diabetes, a heart attack,

00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:21.168
and then kidney cancer on top of it all.

00:26:21.728 --> 00:26:24.068
He suffered from one awful illness after another.

00:26:24.898 --> 00:26:26.238
He did.

00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:30.008
He moved in when Ji Hyuk was a high school freshman, remember?

00:26:31.278 --> 00:26:35.578
But my father also quit his job to care for my mom with dementia.

00:26:35.648 --> 00:26:37.618
He cared for her for over ten years.

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:43.088
And it's already been 11 years since she passed away.

00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:49.728
He's lived alone for all 11 of those years.

00:26:50.428 --> 00:26:51.498
My dad.

00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:53.898
I know, of course.

00:26:54.398 --> 00:26:58.768
My mom lived alone for over 20 years before she passed away too.

00:27:00.838 --> 00:27:03.008
But I really wish my dad...

00:27:03.838 --> 00:27:06.848
would go live with my sibling in the US.

00:27:07.148 --> 00:27:08.748
Then,

00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:11.848
you should call your sibling first, Da Jeong.

00:27:12.118 --> 00:27:16.818
And if they say no, do as she said and take him in.

00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:21.428
They're both almost 90, and they're no strangers.

00:27:21.488 --> 00:27:25.328
Nowadays, men and women can just be friends, you know?

00:27:26.998 --> 00:27:29.328
I've already been thinking about it,

00:27:30.698 --> 00:27:32.838
but I'm too scared of being rejected to ask.

00:27:34.208 --> 00:27:36.508
And I'm so furious with Gyeong Hun.

00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:42.708
My husband's situation is so bad. Until he finds a new job...

00:27:42.778 --> 00:27:45.018
Come on, Sang Cheol is not that kind of guy.

00:27:45.448 --> 00:27:46.948
He's just having trouble finding a job.

00:27:46.948 --> 00:27:48.948
It's the same for most men his age.

00:27:49.518 --> 00:27:53.858
He's just being stubborn, acting tough and trying to provide.

00:27:54.388 --> 00:27:57.328
If you tell him, he'll understand immediately.

00:27:57.658 --> 00:28:00.128
He'll get on his knees and say sorry, if anything.

00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:03.698
Of course, I know how Sang Cheol is.

00:28:10.038 --> 00:28:11.208
Ms. Kim, come in.

00:28:19.778 --> 00:28:21.148
Which one would you like to go with?

00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:28.288
This one already has the highest final score.

00:28:28.788 --> 00:28:30.758
And if you had to pick another one?

00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:36.698
I apologise. The executives did the scoring.

00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:39.768
All right, I understand. You may go.

00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:49.748
Su Bin would know best about this stuff.

00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:07.628
Isn't that Su Bin?

00:29:11.368 --> 00:29:12.768
What am I thinking? It's not Su Bin.

00:29:17.838 --> 00:29:18.838
I'm cold.

00:29:20.608 --> 00:29:23.008
I'm hungry and thirsty.

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:25.578
Maybe I should've brought some water and food.

00:29:26.718 --> 00:29:29.048
What, pack a lunch and water to stage a sit-in?

00:29:29.748 --> 00:29:32.218
You're too scared to be seen to even face forward.

00:29:55.248 --> 00:29:56.408
Oh, man.

00:29:57.948 --> 00:30:00.148
Sir, are you all right?

00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:04.658
Why is it so dark in here? Did the power go out?

00:30:05.118 --> 00:30:06.288
No, sir.

00:30:06.558 --> 00:30:10.758
There was no light under the door. I was worried you'd collapsed.

00:30:11.398 --> 00:30:14.298
Wow, I lost all track of time. Go on. Head home now.

00:30:14.698 --> 00:30:15.698
Bye.

00:30:48.528 --> 00:30:49.828
(No Notifications)

00:30:59.508 --> 00:31:00.908
It's cold.

00:31:01.348 --> 00:31:02.578
Let's go, Su Bin.

00:31:03.148 --> 00:31:05.378
What am I even doing here?

00:31:07.288 --> 00:31:08.388
(Seong Jae)

00:31:14.158 --> 00:31:15.228
Yes, hello?

00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:17.458
Lee Su Bin, come on up.

00:31:18.128 --> 00:31:20.128
You knew I was down here?

00:31:20.258 --> 00:31:22.168
If you're not coming up, I'm leaving for the night.

00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:23.668
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:31:29.108 --> 00:31:31.008
I can't believe he told me to come up.

00:31:34.908 --> 00:31:37.948
Still, it was worth it. I get to see his face.

00:31:38.678 --> 00:31:41.118
(Shoealls)

00:31:44.458 --> 00:31:45.558
Come in.

00:31:54.698 --> 00:31:55.768
Sit.

00:32:00.738 --> 00:32:03.908
Why were you waiting outside? Are you staging a protest?

00:32:06.408 --> 00:32:08.478
Then why did you tell me to come up?

00:32:10.448 --> 00:32:13.548
But how did you know it was me? You couldn't have seen my face.

00:32:13.718 --> 00:32:16.118
It was written on top of your head. It said, "Lee Su Bin."

00:32:16.218 --> 00:32:17.288
What are you talking about?

00:32:17.288 --> 00:32:19.658
I don't know how long you were out,

00:32:19.658 --> 00:32:21.628
and don't care if you waited all day.

00:32:21.688 --> 00:32:25.298
But I have to know the reason because you can't do that again.

00:32:25.658 --> 00:32:29.098
Were you waiting for me to notice and call you up here like this?

00:32:29.298 --> 00:32:31.198
No, that's not it at all.

00:32:32.098 --> 00:32:34.508
I was sitting with my back turned because I was afraid you'd see me.

00:32:37.738 --> 00:32:39.208
I don't even know.

00:32:39.508 --> 00:32:41.778
I don't know why I was sitting there like that.

00:32:42.678 --> 00:32:43.678
What?

00:32:45.148 --> 00:32:47.248
I didn't know what I should do.

00:32:47.848 --> 00:32:51.718
I felt I had to do something, but I didn't know what, so I waited.

00:32:54.288 --> 00:32:55.688
Anyway, I...

00:32:56.988 --> 00:32:58.228
This time, it's for real.

00:33:01.168 --> 00:33:02.728
I really like you.

00:33:05.738 --> 00:33:07.098
That's not my problem.

00:33:09.208 --> 00:33:12.878
Then why did you tell me to come up? And how did you recognise my head?

00:33:13.078 --> 00:33:14.948
Before our product's final meeting,

00:33:14.948 --> 00:33:16.748
I needed feedback from people your age.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:19.978
That's when I happened to see you. That's why I asked you to come up.

00:33:20.588 --> 00:33:22.718
Really? Is that all it was?

00:33:22.788 --> 00:33:25.218
If I hadn't needed your help, I wouldn't have called you.

00:33:25.388 --> 00:33:28.788
I know how stubborn you are. Calling you is like...

00:33:28.988 --> 00:33:30.698
asking for trouble. My gosh.

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:34.098
You sound like a completely different person.

00:33:36.628 --> 00:33:38.568
If you go back to being Ji Hyuk's little sister,

00:33:38.938 --> 00:33:40.908
I can go back to being the nice guy you remember.

00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:48.348
Okay, I get it. So what do you need my help with?

00:33:48.448 --> 00:33:51.118
It must be something important if you called me up here, right?

00:33:51.218 --> 00:33:52.418
So tell me what it is.

00:33:54.348 --> 00:33:57.088
You still see your high school friends, right?

00:33:57.088 --> 00:33:58.818
The ones I used to buy snacks for.

00:33:58.888 --> 00:34:01.188
Get them, Ha Eun, and yourself together,

00:34:01.388 --> 00:34:03.128
take a vote, and let me know...

00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:06.198
which one of these two you'd buy.

00:34:07.298 --> 00:34:09.928
All right, I'll do it. And I'll keep it top secret.

00:34:10.198 --> 00:34:13.438
This can't leak before the launch. It's strictly confidential.

00:34:13.568 --> 00:34:16.568
- I'll pay you for your time. - Forget the pay.

00:34:17.278 --> 00:34:18.738
You can help me with something.

00:34:20.678 --> 00:34:22.148
What now?

00:34:22.478 --> 00:34:24.118
Instead of paying me,

00:34:26.978 --> 00:34:28.788
just go on three dates with me.

00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:30.188
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.388
Just three times. That's all it takes...

00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:36.028
to see if there's something between us. For both of us.

00:34:36.088 --> 00:34:37.228
No.

00:34:37.798 --> 00:34:39.098
You know it too.

00:34:39.728 --> 00:34:41.498
That my feelings for you are real this time.

00:34:43.938 --> 00:34:44.938
And...

00:34:46.068 --> 00:34:47.568
I can't just give up.

00:34:49.808 --> 00:34:52.578
Like I've said before, this is something I just can't hide.

00:34:56.008 --> 00:34:59.578
Three things can't be hidden. Love, poverty, and a sneeze.

00:35:00.948 --> 00:35:02.348
For old times' sake.

00:35:02.788 --> 00:35:04.888
I'll give up if you still won't budge,

00:35:04.888 --> 00:35:07.218
even after I've tried my best.

00:35:08.328 --> 00:35:09.388
What is wrong with you?

00:35:09.728 --> 00:35:12.528
Just 3 times. Is going on 3 dates...

00:35:13.498 --> 00:35:14.498
really that hard?

00:35:23.868 --> 00:35:24.878
Fine.

00:35:26.938 --> 00:35:28.648
Here, go home now.

00:35:32.018 --> 00:35:33.018
You said, "Fine?"

00:35:33.748 --> 00:35:35.018
You mean you'll go on three dates with me?

00:35:35.518 --> 00:35:38.358
Three times. Just three. That's it.

00:35:39.618 --> 00:35:40.628
Got it.

00:35:43.628 --> 00:35:45.358
I'm hungry.

00:35:46.198 --> 00:35:47.228
Wait, you mean you haven't eaten yet?

00:35:50.228 --> 00:35:51.598
Hurry home and get something to eat.

00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:55.538
- Are you going to take me home? - That'll count as one date.

00:35:56.808 --> 00:35:58.478
Fine. I'll go by myself.

00:36:00.508 --> 00:36:03.078
(Shoealls)

00:36:20.058 --> 00:36:21.328
Why did it have to be me?

00:36:22.068 --> 00:36:23.328
This really can't happen.

00:36:23.998 --> 00:36:24.998
I just can't.

00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:31.208
Oh, boy.

00:36:32.238 --> 00:36:34.478
It smells like pine mushrooms.

00:36:35.508 --> 00:36:38.018
- The weather's getting chilly. - Right.

00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:40.278
- Here you go, honey. - Thanks.

00:36:41.248 --> 00:36:45.458
I haven't caught a cold in over ten years, thanks to you.

00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.128
What do you think of this young lady?

00:36:52.858 --> 00:36:55.768
Her father is the Dean of Humanities at Seongmun University,

00:36:56.168 --> 00:36:58.638
and her uncle is an elementary school principal.

00:36:59.098 --> 00:37:01.868
She majored in cello and is preparing for a solo recital.

00:37:02.108 --> 00:37:03.568
And she's 27.

00:37:04.708 --> 00:37:07.308
Are there any other candidates?

00:37:08.908 --> 00:37:10.848
She's the best we're going to get, honey.

00:37:12.078 --> 00:37:16.088
Honestly, I've been quietly asking around everywhere.

00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:18.588
But the rumours about our Seong Jae...

00:37:20.288 --> 00:37:22.958
But at least it's a family of educators.

00:37:23.988 --> 00:37:28.298
The others weren't good-looking, or their character was questionable.

00:37:28.398 --> 00:37:29.768
Or their family background...

00:37:31.138 --> 00:37:34.468
And most importantly, Seong Jae has no interest in dating.

00:37:35.638 --> 00:37:38.638
So we just need to get him to start meeting someone.

00:37:39.978 --> 00:37:44.718
This young lady is so beautiful. Won't he meet her after seeing this?

00:37:46.548 --> 00:37:49.288
What kind of man isn't into women?

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.758
He takes after you.

00:37:54.488 --> 00:37:58.398
You never gave other women a glance until you met me, right?

00:38:03.328 --> 00:38:06.738
Don't just pick one at first glance. Think it over tonight,

00:38:06.838 --> 00:38:08.838
imagine how you'd style it,

00:38:08.838 --> 00:38:10.668
and text me again with your reasoning.

00:38:24.318 --> 00:38:26.488
- What brings you here? - I came to give you this.

00:38:27.418 --> 00:38:29.228
Talk to your mother and set up a date.

00:38:32.398 --> 00:38:33.398
Father.

00:38:34.098 --> 00:38:35.098
What?

00:38:35.498 --> 00:38:36.668
Are you seeing anyone these days?

00:38:38.598 --> 00:38:39.598
No.

00:38:40.638 --> 00:38:42.608
I told you to find someone this year.

00:38:42.608 --> 00:38:44.808
Otherwise, you'll marry the person I choose.

00:38:47.778 --> 00:38:49.008
I'm giving you until the end of the year.

00:38:49.448 --> 00:38:53.078
If you can't find someone by then, that's on you for not being capable.

00:38:54.118 --> 00:38:57.018
In that case, you'll marry whomever we choose for you.

00:38:58.588 --> 00:39:00.258
I'm not thinking about marriage yet.

00:39:01.588 --> 00:39:02.588
Whenever that may be,

00:39:03.328 --> 00:39:05.128
when I find someone I truly want to marry,

00:39:05.398 --> 00:39:06.428
I'll get married then, Father.

00:39:07.898 --> 00:39:09.598
You are the heir to this company.

00:39:10.398 --> 00:39:12.568
Don't you know you have to get married and have children?

00:39:13.138 --> 00:39:15.138
You failed at your first marriage, too.

00:39:16.168 --> 00:39:17.538
Why are you pushing marriage on me so hard?

00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:21.048
I failed the first time,

00:39:21.348 --> 00:39:22.978
but I succeeded the second time.

00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:26.118
Are you just going to give up after one failure?

00:39:27.918 --> 00:39:29.418
If I ever get married again,

00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:32.658
it will be with someone I truly want to be with.

00:39:33.918 --> 00:39:36.888
What about the first time? Didn't you marry the one you wanted?

00:39:38.828 --> 00:39:41.168
It was you who forced that marriage to end, Father.

00:39:46.698 --> 00:39:48.168
When I find the right person,

00:39:48.638 --> 00:39:49.868
I'll get married then, Father.

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:53.108
No, she has to be a suitable woman.

00:39:53.738 --> 00:39:56.108
Your first marriage. Did you get our permission?

00:39:56.878 --> 00:39:59.678
You two hid like rats and got married in secret.

00:40:00.988 --> 00:40:04.858
If you'd married someone suitable, I wouldn't have torn you apart.

00:40:05.918 --> 00:40:08.488
How dare you add a loan shark's girl to our family register?

00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:11.128
And on an impulse, at 23.

00:40:14.098 --> 00:40:17.368
Can you prove she isn't a gold digger who targeted you?

00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:19.298
That marriage...

00:40:20.138 --> 00:40:21.738
was an act of rebellion, you fool.

00:40:27.848 --> 00:40:28.908
Then what about this woman?

00:40:30.148 --> 00:40:33.178
Is she worthy of our family?

00:40:34.718 --> 00:40:38.188
So if she's "worthy" of our family, I'm supposed to marry just anyone?

00:40:38.658 --> 00:40:41.558
Your mother vetted her thoroughly.

00:40:41.758 --> 00:40:44.158
So if Mother vetted her, that makes her a decent person?

00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:47.328
I trust that she is.

00:40:48.398 --> 00:40:49.768
If it's someone your mother vetted,

00:40:50.298 --> 00:40:51.298
she'll be just like her.

00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:53.998
How can you be so sure?

00:40:55.438 --> 00:40:58.338
You always said Mother was different from my birth mother.

00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:01.248
That she's a completely different kind of person.

00:41:04.818 --> 00:41:05.818
That's right. And since you're...

00:41:06.548 --> 00:41:08.948
old enough to be a father now, I'll tell you this.

00:41:10.448 --> 00:41:11.458
That woman...

00:41:12.188 --> 00:41:14.858
is someone who knows how to love a child fiercely.

00:41:15.888 --> 00:41:18.228
And that's why I can love her with all my heart.

00:41:26.398 --> 00:41:27.398
That's unexpected.

00:41:28.868 --> 00:41:30.808
That you remarried for love...

00:41:31.778 --> 00:41:32.908
I never knew.

00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:37.478
What made me fall for her was her maternal instinct.

00:41:38.518 --> 00:41:40.718
I didn't see her as a woman first, but as a mother.

00:41:42.648 --> 00:41:45.858
Her heartbreaking maternal love is what I saw first.

00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:50.258
(Winter, 1998)

00:41:51.428 --> 00:41:52.698
The traffic is terrible.

00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:54.968
We're going to be late for our appointment.

00:41:56.998 --> 00:42:00.398
- There must be an accident. - Yes.

00:42:03.208 --> 00:42:04.608
Excuse me! Taxi!

00:42:05.638 --> 00:42:06.638
- What? - Wait.

00:42:06.708 --> 00:42:09.208
Wait! Please, just one second! Wait!

00:42:09.708 --> 00:42:10.708
- No! - What's going on?

00:42:11.818 --> 00:42:13.778
My son is sick!

00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:17.218
We have to get to the hospital! Please, let me get a cab!

00:42:17.688 --> 00:42:19.418
My son is dying!

00:42:19.718 --> 00:42:23.228
- Mr. Kim, let's give her a ride. - Yes, sir.

00:42:26.858 --> 00:42:28.998
Ma'am! Over here.

00:42:29.298 --> 00:42:31.098
- Please get in. - What?

00:42:31.168 --> 00:42:32.168
We'll give you a ride.

00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:34.638
Okay.

00:42:34.908 --> 00:42:35.908
- You can get in the back. - Yes.

00:42:35.968 --> 00:42:38.238
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:42:41.548 --> 00:42:42.548
Thank you.

00:42:44.418 --> 00:42:45.418
Where are you headed?

00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:47.348
Yongjin Hospital, Paediatrics.

00:43:24.788 --> 00:43:28.028
(Yongjin Hospital)

00:43:31.428 --> 00:43:32.428
Thank you so much.

00:43:32.728 --> 00:43:33.758
Thank you.

00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:45.338
I wonder what's wrong with him.

00:43:45.978 --> 00:43:47.578
She must be an acquaintance of yours, sir.

00:43:49.778 --> 00:43:52.518
I've seen her around, but I wouldn't say we're acquainted.

00:43:54.648 --> 00:43:58.888
Yes, Doctor. I won't just make good enough shoes.

00:44:01.258 --> 00:44:03.758
I want to create shoes with real, high-performance features.

00:44:04.528 --> 00:44:07.798
- My gosh. - You must have caught a cold.

00:44:09.128 --> 00:44:10.128
Oh, please.

00:44:10.498 --> 00:44:11.498
If this is a cold,

00:44:11.938 --> 00:44:13.598
then I guess no second round tonight, Doctor.

00:44:18.038 --> 00:44:22.278
This is homemade ginger tea. It's great for a cold.

00:44:22.908 --> 00:44:25.548
Wait. How did you know to prepare this?

00:44:27.278 --> 00:44:30.748
I noticed he was coughing a bit when he was here three days ago.

00:44:32.918 --> 00:44:34.458
Is this your way of saying thank you for the other day?

00:44:35.758 --> 00:44:36.758
I'm sorry?

00:44:37.128 --> 00:44:38.358
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:44:39.458 --> 00:44:42.368
I gave you a ride to the hospital. On that snowy day.

00:44:43.528 --> 00:44:44.538
My goodness.

00:44:45.138 --> 00:44:46.138
Oh, gosh.

00:44:46.638 --> 00:44:47.738
That was you, sir?

00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:49.768
I'm so sorry.

00:44:50.238 --> 00:44:52.938
I was in such a panic that day. I don't think I even saw your face.

00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:54.608
I'm truly sorry.

00:44:55.778 --> 00:44:57.478
And thank you so much.

00:45:00.748 --> 00:45:04.188
She was a server at a restaurant where I was a regular,

00:45:04.758 --> 00:45:06.058
but she didn't even recognise me.

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:08.688
Because of Woo Jin's high fever that day,

00:45:09.428 --> 00:45:11.198
she was blind to everything else.

00:45:12.598 --> 00:45:13.758
It's a homemade syrup.

00:45:14.728 --> 00:45:16.768
It's not much, but it's all I have to offer.

00:45:17.268 --> 00:45:18.898
I'm so grateful for what you did.

00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:23.368
When you get a throat tickle, have a cup of this. It really helps.

00:45:33.518 --> 00:45:36.618
It turned out that Woo Jin had an acute fever,

00:45:37.218 --> 00:45:39.688
and his temperature was spiking over 40°C.

00:45:40.318 --> 00:45:42.628
She was on her way to the hospital for his surgery,

00:45:44.128 --> 00:45:47.628
so I saw that desperate, heart-wrenching motherly love.

00:45:48.428 --> 00:45:50.098
And I saw her true character.

00:45:52.538 --> 00:45:55.238
I saw her in a situation that she could have never faked.

00:46:00.738 --> 00:46:01.748
I see.

00:46:03.508 --> 00:46:04.508
And another thing, son.

00:46:05.248 --> 00:46:08.018
You've known her for 26 years yourself.

00:46:08.488 --> 00:46:09.488
In all that time,

00:46:09.848 --> 00:46:12.258
you've seen how steadfast she is, and you still have to ask?

00:46:14.288 --> 00:46:15.288
Yes.

00:46:16.058 --> 00:46:17.228
You're right. She has been consistent.

00:46:19.058 --> 00:46:22.868
So? Are you finally thinking about settling down with a decent person?

00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:28.968
Right now, I just want to focus on the new product launch.

00:46:29.908 --> 00:46:32.578
Fine. I'm telling you to think about it after that's done.

00:46:35.308 --> 00:46:36.308
I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow.

00:46:40.978 --> 00:46:42.748
- Get some rest. - You too.

00:46:52.128 --> 00:46:53.958
I wonder if she was different with her own son.

00:46:57.328 --> 00:46:58.338
I never saw that side of her.

00:47:17.888 --> 00:47:19.718
My friends' verdict? This model, 100 percent.

00:47:24.928 --> 00:47:28.128
This one's my pick too. I wore Shoe Joy shoes to work, right?

00:47:28.328 --> 00:47:31.228
They were really comfortable, but they weren't for my generation.

00:47:31.698 --> 00:47:33.798
But this one? I'd totally wear it.

00:47:34.198 --> 00:47:37.038
It goes with jeans, dresses, and more.

00:47:37.038 --> 00:47:38.808
I even matched outfits to the photos.

00:47:41.878 --> 00:47:43.008
She even matched outfits?

00:47:44.308 --> 00:47:46.018
Product number one, which scored the highest,

00:47:46.018 --> 00:47:47.748
will be the main item,

00:47:48.118 --> 00:47:49.748
and the sporty and casual lines are being produced...

00:47:50.218 --> 00:47:51.558
in order of priority.

00:47:52.118 --> 00:47:53.118
All right.

00:47:58.828 --> 00:47:59.828
Mr. Chairman.

00:48:00.928 --> 00:48:04.598
Yes. You had a point to make before we finalized the lineup.

00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:07.068
Yes. I'd like to...

00:48:07.668 --> 00:48:09.838
propose we change the main line to number two.

00:48:16.948 --> 00:48:19.018
If our company is going to continue to grow,

00:48:19.318 --> 00:48:21.388
attracting a younger customer base has to be our top priority.

00:48:22.688 --> 00:48:23.918
Number one is a classic design,

00:48:24.248 --> 00:48:26.358
while number two will also appeal to a younger demographic.

00:48:26.488 --> 00:48:28.658
So we should alienate our existing customers...

00:48:28.658 --> 00:48:30.688
and only target younger people?

00:48:31.898 --> 00:48:35.968
When you say "existing customers," do you mean our older clients?

00:48:38.368 --> 00:48:40.798
These days, even people in their 50s and 60s care about design.

00:48:41.568 --> 00:48:43.668
You can't view people in their 70s and 80s the way you used to.

00:48:54.048 --> 00:48:56.088
They're shoe photos from top fashionistas...

00:48:56.088 --> 00:48:57.888
in their 50s and 60s in Korea and worldwide,

00:48:58.558 --> 00:49:01.588
as well as currently trending shoes among people in their 20s and 30s.

00:49:02.128 --> 00:49:03.758
As I'm sure you can all see,

00:49:04.328 --> 00:49:06.298
you'll notice there isn't much of a difference.

00:49:06.598 --> 00:49:09.328
Young people want comfortable shoes too,

00:49:09.328 --> 00:49:11.398
but they also have to be stylish.

00:49:12.168 --> 00:49:15.368
I find number two's design to be minimalist,

00:49:15.468 --> 00:49:18.478
and the black colour will complement a wide variety of looks,

00:49:19.108 --> 00:49:20.978
working well with both casual and formal wear.

00:49:23.048 --> 00:49:26.448
Are you saying we ignore the vote, which is one of the company's rules?

00:49:28.148 --> 00:49:30.148
Sometimes, you must change the rules to move forward.

00:49:32.718 --> 00:49:33.888
I see number two...

00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:36.728
as our company's next main product line.

00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:50.708
Fine. Go ahead.

00:49:52.138 --> 00:49:53.578
As the chief director, you put together a team...

00:49:54.008 --> 00:49:56.078
and handle PR, production, and sales strategy.

00:49:58.518 --> 00:49:59.518
Thank you, sir.

00:50:02.948 --> 00:50:04.148
Eighty-seven percent.

00:50:06.518 --> 00:50:08.958
The top contenders are Rumiko and Yeongsin Paper.

00:50:09.328 --> 00:50:11.928
If Rumiko gets it, AP Group will be absorbed.

00:50:12.098 --> 00:50:14.458
Yeongsin Paper has no experience in this sector.

00:50:15.428 --> 00:50:19.338
If we can just get more funding, we'll have a fighting chance.

00:50:19.968 --> 00:50:21.568
Either way, when you sell a company, it's all about the money.

00:50:22.108 --> 00:50:23.268
Money always comes first.

00:50:23.738 --> 00:50:27.538
But a chairman who let his sons live as a doctor and a musician...

00:50:27.978 --> 00:50:29.408
might just have a different way of thinking.

00:50:30.348 --> 00:50:32.818
We still have four days left. Mr. Hong,

00:50:32.948 --> 00:50:35.088
send me the graph of our cumulative investments.

00:50:35.788 --> 00:50:38.388
We need to pressure the investors by showing our goal is almost met.

00:50:38.488 --> 00:50:39.488
Understood.

00:50:40.988 --> 00:50:43.258
By the way, our partner is running late today.

00:50:48.198 --> 00:50:50.398
(Ha Sung Guk, Partner at Moment)

00:50:51.638 --> 00:50:52.798
Hey, where are you?

00:50:52.898 --> 00:50:56.638
Boyang Construction just called. They're pulling their investment.

00:50:57.908 --> 00:50:58.908
What?

00:50:59.978 --> 00:51:01.708
- Great work, everyone. - Thank you, sir.

00:51:01.778 --> 00:51:03.448
- Yes. - Wait!

00:51:06.148 --> 00:51:07.148
What is going on?

00:51:07.478 --> 00:51:09.448
Is it true you've sided with Yeongsin?

00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:14.688
They presented a better offer.

00:51:15.228 --> 00:51:16.528
The board made the decision.

00:51:17.158 --> 00:51:18.658
I do feel bad for you about this, Mr. Lee.

00:51:19.058 --> 00:51:20.058
Wait a minute, Mr. Min.

00:51:20.658 --> 00:51:22.998
But you already signed a letter of intent with us.

00:51:23.898 --> 00:51:26.338
If you got another offer, you should have told us first.

00:51:26.738 --> 00:51:29.968
You haven't signed the contract with Yeongsin yet, right?

00:51:32.108 --> 00:51:34.508
Mamdaerozip hasn't secured the acquisition funds,

00:51:34.778 --> 00:51:36.408
while Yeongsin has more than enough!

00:51:36.908 --> 00:51:38.278
Frankly, in business,

00:51:38.678 --> 00:51:40.978
you look out for yourself. It's not a charity, is it?

00:51:44.588 --> 00:51:46.658
Chalk it up to experience. Got it?

00:51:47.558 --> 00:51:48.558
Let's go.

00:51:56.368 --> 00:51:57.698
Mr. Lee!

00:51:57.928 --> 00:51:59.898
Go through the investor list again.

00:52:00.438 --> 00:52:01.738
Even the ones we weeded out at the start.

00:52:04.438 --> 00:52:05.478
Snap out of it, Mr. Lee.

00:52:09.078 --> 00:52:11.508
Ten million just went up in smoke. We still couldn't meet the price.

00:52:12.248 --> 00:52:14.018
There are still four days left until the final bid.

00:52:15.918 --> 00:52:16.918
Let's face reality.

00:52:18.188 --> 00:52:21.388
It seems Lady Luck isn't on your side this time.

00:52:23.658 --> 00:52:24.928
If you feel you can't help me anymore,

00:52:26.598 --> 00:52:27.598
I'll understand.

00:52:38.638 --> 00:52:40.538
Is there any way we can move up the meeting to today?

00:52:41.208 --> 00:52:42.208
I'm sorry.

00:52:42.508 --> 00:52:46.918
Your equity ratio is too low, so we have decided not to invest.

00:53:05.638 --> 00:53:07.868
Your passion and vision are great.

00:53:08.168 --> 00:53:10.838
But when it comes to running a company like AP...

00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:12.878
With only four days until the bid,

00:53:13.438 --> 00:53:14.808
and you've only raised 50 percent of the funds?

00:53:15.248 --> 00:53:16.778
We were interested in investing,

00:53:17.148 --> 00:53:19.178
but after an internal review, we've decided against it.

00:53:52.518 --> 00:53:54.778
I guess Ji Hyuk isn't coming today.

00:54:08.158 --> 00:54:09.768
Why are you just standing there?

00:54:12.538 --> 00:54:13.598
I'm hungry.

00:54:22.278 --> 00:54:24.178
What's wrong?

00:54:27.248 --> 00:54:28.548
Will you eat with me?

00:54:33.088 --> 00:54:35.088
I'm not really hungry right now.

00:54:40.228 --> 00:54:41.328
All right. Never mind.

00:54:59.018 --> 00:55:01.018
It's just one meal.

00:55:02.488 --> 00:55:03.548

Oh, yes.

We found a match for the DNA sample you registered.

Hello? Are you still there?

00:55:25.208 --> 00:55:27.108
Yes, and?

00:55:28.178 --> 00:55:30.878
The other party is eager to meet as soon as possible.

00:55:30.948 --> 00:55:32.048
Are you available tomorrow?

They're eager to meet me?

00:55:47.098 --> 00:55:48.628

I wasn't an abandoned child.

I was lost.

00:56:30.708 --> 00:56:33.038
Then why am I crying so much?

00:56:34.638 --> 00:56:36.148
I never even once...

00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:39.778
thought about wanting to see my birth parents.

00:56:42.048 --> 00:56:43.418
But I guess that wasn't true.

00:56:45.458 --> 00:56:47.288
I guess I hated the idea because I thought I was abandoned.

00:56:48.018 --> 00:56:49.958
I guess I didn't even want to think about it.

00:56:51.458 --> 00:56:52.998
Of course.

00:56:54.158 --> 00:56:55.398

He just couldn't let it go.

He went to try and sort it out on his own.

00:58:25.358 --> 00:58:27.188
He could've at least given me a call.

00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:29.958
For the time being, don't answer Ji Hyuk's calls.

00:58:30.528 --> 00:58:31.958
He might try to lean on you for help.

00:58:32.258 --> 00:58:34.298
