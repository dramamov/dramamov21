00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.778
An animal lover
who's gentle-hearted and gay,

00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:08.179
Genichi Hatano.

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:10.515
The man he fell for

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:12.050
is a gay middle school teacher,

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:13.017
Saku Sakuta.

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:15.286
I broke up with my partner
and ended our cohabitation.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:16.721
I was spending the night in my car.

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:18.556
What do you think about buying a house?

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:20.091
Could you not come any closer?

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:21.926
The student who gives Saku a headache,

00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:23.128
Hotaru Kusunoki,

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.296
is a 15-year-old Toyoko regular.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:27.532
That is when…

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.434
-What the?
-I'm buying you.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:30.735
Parent-Child Contract.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:32.504
I need someone to pretend to be my parent.

00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:35.140
Party A’s mother, Tomoe Kusunoki,

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:38.109
is wanted for embezzlement
from her company and is on the run.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.111
Since then, I’ve been on my own.

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:42.814
After hearing Hotaru's story,

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:44.949
Genichi decides to pose as her dad.

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:45.917
I'm Jin Ichigaya.

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:47.452
Meanwhile, her actual dad…

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.853
Did Mom call you?

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.824
…seems to be plotting something.

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.126
I left a suitcase.

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:58.196
What’s inside belongs to us.

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:00.165
I’m leaving it in your care.

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:01.399
I'll be back.

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:04.536
Thank you.

TOMOE KUSUNOKI

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:25.623
Off you go.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:41.806
Good morning.

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:43.208
Morning.

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:46.077
I made too much breakfast.

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:47.278
I always skip breakfast.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.547
I've got salmon, seaweed, kelp,

00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:51.149
-sesame and salt.
-Listen.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.051
-Pick whichever--
-I'm good.

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:54.686
Oh, by any chance,

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.789
are you one of those people
who can’t eat food made by others?

00:01:57.855 --> 00:01:59.324
That's not it.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.959
You can rest assured.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.428
I wrapped them in cling film
before shaping them.

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:04.629
As I said,

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.732
-I don’t need any!
-Oh, I get it.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.667
You wouldn't want anything

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.970
from an old guy like me.

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:12.804
Right?

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:16.274
May I have kelp, please?

00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.308
No need to force--

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.243
One kelp, please!

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:22.547
-I'm starting to get hungry.
-Is that right?

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:23.715
Then, here's your kelp.

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.288
You really don’t have to mind me.
Once I find a place, I’ll move out.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.225
If you want, I can introduce you
to a property agent.

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:36.794
I've got a friend who works as one.

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:39.264
-I'm sure he'll help you out.
-Oh, shoot!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.599
Sorry, I'm running late.

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.634
Okay.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.534
Sorry about this.

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:44.869
We're leaving.

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.037
Drive safely.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:51.876
‎INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:52.844
Good morning.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.911
Good morning.

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:55.446
-Pick one you like.
-Hm?

00:02:55.513 --> 00:02:56.381
Your breakfast.

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:57.382
I'm fine with any.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.651
That's the hardest to work with.

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:01.252
-Pick one--
-Salmon!

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.854
Okay. Good morning.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.722
-Good morning.
-Morning.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:05.657
Go ahead.

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:07.825
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:09.560
Thank you!

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:12.664
What's that?

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:15.199
Scavengers have been appearing lately.

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:17.035
They’re probably just hungry,

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:19.103
so I put this here to keep the crows away.

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:22.040
Both of you should get going!

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.241
-See you.
-See you.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:24.275
Let's go.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:26.878
You can eat at least two, yes?

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:33.117
You only need to act like my dad
when I ask you to.

00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:34.018
Huh?

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:35.820
Please don't get too involved.

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:37.255
Bye.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.930
But make sure you don't expose yourself
in front of my teacher!

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:46.998
Keep up the parent act.

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:49.500
Right, got it.

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:07.285
Keep up the act?

00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:35.313
-How may I help you?
-Huh?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.614
I'm the landlady.

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:39.817
Please pardon my rudeness.

00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:42.286
I'll come back later.

Embezzlement of 30 million yen?

00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:59.937
A female employee is currently on the run.

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:02.306
On the second of this month,

00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:04.475
in a company located in Suginami, Tokyo,

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:06.110
around 30 million yen

00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:08.780
was discovered missing.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.448
-Old news, huh?
-It was found that employee

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.183
-What?
-Tomoe Kusunoki, age 43…

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.352
-I knew it. I've seen it before.
-Hey!

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.053
It was in the news a while back.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.856
-Thirty million, eh? How nice.
-Police say the suspect, Kusunoki,

00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:22.560
has been missing
since the case came to light.

00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:26.898
Hi.

00:05:26.964 --> 00:05:29.167
-Thanks for looking after my daughter.
-Hey!

00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:37.508
I knew you looked familiar!

00:05:37.575 --> 00:05:38.643
What do you want?

00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:41.546
Did you make up with him?

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:42.713
Who are you referring to?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.215
Oh, come on now!

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.517
You were with him at the crepe place.

00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:49.821
I’ve never eaten a crepe before.

00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:52.623
That’s a bit hard to believe.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.091
If you’ll excuse me.

00:05:56.794 --> 00:05:58.262
REAL ESTATE SITE

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.230
Are you moving?

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:01.599
-Huh?
-With your girlfriend.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:04.368
It's only for me.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.337
Really, man?

00:06:06.404 --> 00:06:09.307
You’re eating a homemade rice ball,
so I thought you got a girlfriend.

00:06:09.373 --> 00:06:11.175
Plus, you're browsing apartments,

00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:12.677
so I was convinced that you and her--

00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:14.078
You couldn't be more wrong!

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:15.346
Mr. Sakuta.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.982
Oh, hold on.

00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:21.853
Here.

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:24.522

No idea.

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:28.025
Nothing comes to mind at all?

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:31.329
If I had to name one, it'd be miso soup.

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:32.497
And shishamo.

00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:34.465
I'm not asking about what you like to eat.

00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:35.366
Then, I'm out of ideas.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:37.602
You could start with the things you like

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:39.270
or with the high school you want to go to.

00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:41.172
High school?

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:42.740
-You're going, right?
-Probably.

00:06:42.807 --> 00:06:44.809
List a few schools that interest you
and resubmit it.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:47.111
If you’re unsure, you can ask
your dad or me.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.412
Feel free to consult, yeah?

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:51.682

CAREER PATH GUIDANCE

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:01.659
I have this one.
I always put it on my bag.

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:02.627
What are you doing?

00:07:03.227 --> 00:07:06.397
We've got some leftover keychains
from organizing the shop’s stock.

00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:08.366
Mr. Hatano, if there’s anything you want…

00:07:08.432 --> 00:07:09.433
Are you sure it's okay?

00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:11.769
Oh, wow.

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:12.703
What's this?

00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:15.406
-A bird?
-Nah.

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:16.374
Really?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.675
Look, it has four legs.

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:18.776
Oh, you're right.

00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:20.344
Then, what is it?

00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:22.280
But it's kinda cute.

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:24.382
It seems to be smiling too.

00:07:25.082 --> 00:07:26.751
Doesn't it look angry though?

00:07:26.817 --> 00:07:27.785
No, it's crying.

00:07:29.787 --> 00:07:34.592
Walk, walk, a little walk

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.729
Angry? Sad?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.464
Wanna have a water break?

00:07:40.531 --> 00:07:41.365
Okay.

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:43.935
Here you go.

00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:46.837
Walk…

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.373
-Do you need a receipt?
-Nope.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.242
Thank you.

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:54.011
-Welcome.
-Here.

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:02.820
Do you have something to prove your age?

00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.523
I don’t have it with me right now.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.024
Deadass,

00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:08.859
I thought I could pull it off!

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.027
Weirdly confident.

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:11.662
Anyone can tell you're a minor.

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:13.898
You should've told me before I queued up!

00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:14.865
Oh, Bayashiko!

00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:16.200
-Yo!
-What's up!

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:17.802
What are you all doing?

00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:19.637
A game. Have a look!

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:22.340
That cashier is crazy with the age checks.

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:24.475
No matter how adult-like you act,
you can’t get past him.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.310
Apparently, no one has ever succeeded.

00:08:26.377 --> 00:08:29.080
So, we're trying to see
who's able to succeed first.

00:08:29.146 --> 00:08:31.949
-Huh? What a dumb game!
-Thank you.

00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:33.217
What about that guy?

00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:36.954
-No way he's a teen.
-Do you have something to prove your age?

00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:38.456
He's got to be an uncle.

00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:39.724
I'm clearly an adult.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.525
He looks every bit an old man.

00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:44.895
Sorry, sir,

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:47.498
you’re under 20,
so I can’t sell you alcohol.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:49.800
-What? He's a minor?
-How did he know?

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:52.770
This is going to be a tough battle.

00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:54.939
We just gotta act like an adult, right?

00:08:55.606 --> 00:08:57.174
Like, worry about health exam results.

00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.476
Or raise our voices on the phone.

00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:00.277
Or talk endlessly about our younger days!

00:09:00.344 --> 00:09:01.812
That's it!

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.314
What are you all up to?

00:09:04.448 --> 00:09:05.883
-Or grow a beard.
-What?

00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:09.153
In any case, it's getting late.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.054
Or being a busybody.

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:12.790
Oh, this is such a stupid game!

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:14.358
What's going on?

00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:17.762
REAL ESTATE SITE

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:19.730
Good evening.

00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:21.966
Sorry for intruding.

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:24.402
Oh, not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

00:09:24.468 --> 00:09:26.103
Not that I have any right to say so.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.509
It was delicious. The rice ball, I meant.

00:09:32.643 --> 00:09:33.711
That's great to hear!

00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:43.888
Sorry, but about my daughter…

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.158
What about her?

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:49.427
How much do you know about her mom's case?

00:09:49.493 --> 00:09:52.329
Nothing beyond what’s in the news.

00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:53.898
Right.

00:09:53.964 --> 00:09:55.966
Did they not ask you for any details?

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.335
The police, I mean.
Since you’re her ex-husband.

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:00.905
Well…

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.140
REAL ESTATE SITE

00:10:05.109 --> 00:10:08.112
About the property agent
I told you this morning…

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:09.580
I'm good, really.

00:10:09.647 --> 00:10:11.115
But…

00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:13.551
I’ve been depending on you a bit too much.

00:10:13.617 --> 00:10:16.253
I feel this isn’t really appropriate.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.855
After all, we're teacher and parent.

00:10:17.922 --> 00:10:19.323
But that property agent…

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.524
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:23.461
Distance. Keep your distance.

00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:25.963
But this is really for your sake, Sakuta.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.398
What does that mean?

00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:29.366
He’s really a great guy.

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:30.468
He even takes guys

00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:33.838
like us into account
when looking for a place.

00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:35.873
I'm good.

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:39.110
You’ve already got a place in mind?

00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:42.813
Not… yet.

00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:44.782
Then…

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.051
Okay?

00:10:48.552 --> 00:10:49.854
Very well.

00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.289
-Please go ahead with it.
-Alright.

00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:55.126
See you.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:56.761
I'm home, Dad!

00:10:56.827 --> 00:10:58.262
Oh, welcome home.

00:10:58.329 --> 00:10:59.330
You're late.

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:02.500
Good night.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.937
Good night…

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.609
Good night!

00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:15.913
I met your dad today.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.748
The real one.

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:18.649
Where?

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:20.351
The park.

00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:21.519
It was purely coincidence.

00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:22.686
Did you guys talk?

00:11:22.753 --> 00:11:23.854
Not much.

00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:26.757
We just talked about the time
at the crepe place, and that's about it.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.428
You'll still be here for a while, right?

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:32.863
Yes.

00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:35.432
Until my teacher sleeps.

00:11:37.434 --> 00:11:39.670
Okay then, let's have dinner.

00:11:40.738 --> 00:11:42.239
Here you go.

00:11:45.242 --> 00:11:46.777
What do you usually eat?

00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:50.881
Discounted supermarket bento.

00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:53.284
And sometimes I make miso soup myself.

00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:57.321
Really? Okay, let's eat. Have a seat.

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:02.259
Let's dig in!

00:12:03.394 --> 00:12:04.762
Thank you…

00:12:13.437 --> 00:12:14.672
What, it doesn't taste good?

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:16.340
No…

00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:18.442
It just tastes different.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:19.410
What do you mean?

00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:20.911
From my mom's.

00:12:21.612 --> 00:12:22.446
How does hers taste?

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:24.548
-She had a secret ingredient.
-Yeah?

00:12:24.615 --> 00:12:25.716
And it makes the soup mild.

00:12:25.783 --> 00:12:28.886
I see. What's the secret ingredient?

00:12:29.987 --> 00:12:31.455
-A secret.
-Figured.

00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:35.860
-What kind of person was your mom?
-Hm?

00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:38.462
Well, you know… It’d be weird
not to know, right?

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:41.532
Like her hobbies, personality, quirks…

00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:45.436
-Are they similar to yours?
-Not at all.

00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:46.637
Be it looks or personality.

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:47.771
Is that so?

00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:53.043
She just seemed like someone
who works really hard.

00:12:54.345 --> 00:12:55.546
She was doing her best

00:12:55.613 --> 00:12:57.147
at lots of things, I think.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.083
Then both of you are similar.

00:13:04.154 --> 00:13:05.256
I don't know.

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:08.325
HIBINO REAL ESTATE

00:13:08.392 --> 00:13:09.493
Wait, wait… Huh?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.962
You’re going to pretend to be
that Kusunoki girl's parent

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:14.798
and her homeroom teacher
is on his way now? Huh?

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:17.034
Sorry for dragging you into this.

00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:19.003
-This is entertaining!
-What?

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:20.170
Leave it to me.

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:21.272
I’ll help with anything.

00:13:22.539 --> 00:13:24.875
Also, I’m supposed to go by my stage name.

00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:26.176
What stage name?

00:13:26.243 --> 00:13:28.612
When I was aiming to be a musician…
Go along with it, okay?

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:30.381
Stage name…?

00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:31.382
Welcome!

00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:33.550
Over here.

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:35.853
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.154
Nice to meet you.

00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:39.657
I’m from Hibino Real Estate…

00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:41.592
and my name is Okabe.

00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:44.194
I'm Sakuta.

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.397
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same here.

00:13:46.463 --> 00:13:47.331
Have a seat.

00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:48.232
-Here.
-Thank you.

00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:50.601
Some water too.

00:13:52.202 --> 00:13:53.604
He roughly knows the situation.

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:58.108
You're Kusunoki's homeroom teacher, right?

00:13:58.175 --> 00:13:59.243
Yes.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.379
And I'm borrowing the yard
at Inokashira Apartments.

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:03.714
Sorry for the late notification.

00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:06.884
No issues. As long as you’ve spoken
with the landlady,

00:14:06.951 --> 00:14:08.052
we’re fine.

00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:09.687
-Thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.794
Were both of you classmates
or something like that?

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.028
Oh, no.

00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:20.998
It started when Genichi
was busking at the station…

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:23.434
So, people do call him by his stage name!

00:14:24.168 --> 00:14:25.169
Pardon?

00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:28.872
Yeah! Of course!

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:32.776
Right. His stage name…

00:14:33.444 --> 00:14:34.511
Genichi.

00:14:37.114 --> 00:14:38.582
Well then, let's get started right away.

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:39.850
Right.

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.619
Let’s start by hearing your requirements.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.588
Okay.

00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:46.991
‎Please give me a moment.

00:14:50.194 --> 00:14:51.028
Um…

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:53.397
I'm fine by myself from here on.

00:14:54.331 --> 00:14:55.366
Just in case, you know…

00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:57.701
NARIWADAI HIGH SCHOOL

00:14:59.636 --> 00:15:00.604
TRUE MIRIN

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:10.381
BAYASHIKO IS TRYING
TO BYPASS THE AGE-CHECK TODAY!

00:15:10.447 --> 00:15:11.949
ALL TO GATHER AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE!

00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:19.223
-You scared me!
-My bad.

00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:20.524
What is it?

00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:21.792
The other day,

00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:25.562
some middle-aged man came by.

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:26.463
A man?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.931
I don't know how to put it,

00:15:27.998 --> 00:15:29.033
but he had a shady vibe.

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:34.638
-What's that?
-I'll leave this with you.

00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:36.440
Use this when things go south.

00:15:36.507 --> 00:15:37.408
-Huh?
-Take it.

00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:40.511
Restrain him like this, okay?

00:15:40.577 --> 00:15:41.412
Hey, wait!

00:15:48.018 --> 00:15:50.454
DAD

00:15:53.624 --> 00:15:57.094
Based on your requirements,

00:15:57.728 --> 00:15:59.396
it’d be these few apartments.

00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:00.664
Thank you.

00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:02.099
Oh?

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:04.701
Is there any place that catches your eye?

00:16:04.768 --> 00:16:06.737
Let me see…

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:08.238
This one, maybe.

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:09.740
I'm not asking you, Genichi.

00:16:09.807 --> 00:16:10.707
Right.

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:14.678
Is there a place where I wouldn’t
have to run into the other residents?

00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:15.612
Huh?

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.915
I don’t really like people prying
into my business.

00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:19.883
Oh, okay.

00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:23.053
Is he aware of that?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.288
No. I'll leave that to you.

00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:27.658
Well, uh…

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:28.926
I'm gay as well.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.361
Is that so?

00:16:31.962 --> 00:16:33.964
So, you’d prefer to avoid seeing people?

00:16:34.031 --> 00:16:35.432
At my previous place,

00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:37.868
I lived with my partner.

00:16:38.402 --> 00:16:41.238
People stared at us a lot
when we were together.

00:16:41.905 --> 00:16:43.507
This time, I’m living alone,

00:16:43.574 --> 00:16:45.509
so it’s fine as long as I’m careful.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.312
I just thought I’d mention it,

00:16:49.613 --> 00:16:51.782
since I heard
you’re understanding about it.

00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:53.917
I’m sure you already know,

00:16:53.984 --> 00:16:56.787
but these days, some properties
call themselves LGBTQ-friendly,

00:16:56.854 --> 00:16:59.756
and they don't discriminate
based on sexuality.

00:16:59.823 --> 00:17:01.592
There are a few places like that around.

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.360
With your requirements however,

00:17:03.427 --> 00:17:05.896
there aren’t really any
I can recommend at the moment.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.764
Based on what I've heard, though,

00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:10.367
the places that don’t seem discriminatory

00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:14.171
and seem like comfortable environments
are this… and this.

00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:16.840
What do you think?
Any you’d like to go see?

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:19.476
Let me think.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.712
Hey, does this have rooftop access?

00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:24.314
Oh, yes. There's no balcony,
but in place of that…

00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:27.284
Airing out the futon there
would feel so nice.

00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:28.585
You could even stargaze, right?

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:30.921
Oh, that’s so nice. Don't you think so?

00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:32.156
This one too!

00:17:32.222 --> 00:17:33.857
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

00:17:34.424 --> 00:17:37.094
Sorry, I got too carried away.

00:17:39.129 --> 00:17:41.899
Let’s check this one out
for the time being.

00:17:41.965 --> 00:17:44.334
Very well. Please wait a moment.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.272
Your previous place

00:17:49.006 --> 00:17:50.574
was where you lived with Yoshida?

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:51.808
That's right.

00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:53.810
He might still be living there alone.

00:17:54.545 --> 00:17:55.746
How are things since then?

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.548
What do you mean?

00:17:58.549 --> 00:18:00.651
Well, between you and Yoshida.

00:18:01.318 --> 00:18:04.388
-Nothing happened, unfortunately.
-Unfortunately?

00:18:04.454 --> 00:18:06.290
You were hoping
we'd get back together, no?

00:18:06.957 --> 00:18:10.460
Oh, no. You shouldn't get back together.
Just let things move forward as they are.

00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:12.763
Huh?

00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:15.232
We're able to do a viewing this weekend.
Does that work?

00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:17.968
Hold on…

00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:20.404
This weekend…

00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:22.172
This weekend works.

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:25.409
Huh?

00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:26.877
What?

00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:28.545
How was the parent-teacher meeting?

00:18:28.612 --> 00:18:30.981
Have you decided on your path?

00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:35.752
Are you studying hard for exams?

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:38.355
Didn't I say not to interfere?
What's with you?

00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:40.624
No, you didn't.

00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:42.626
Please stop coming to my apartment too.

00:18:42.693 --> 00:18:44.361
450 YEN FOR CREPE

00:18:44.428 --> 00:18:45.295
You came, didn't you?

00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:50.934
The 30 million yen.

00:18:51.868 --> 00:18:52.836
Where did you hide it?

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.672
You must know something, right?

00:18:56.273 --> 00:18:57.140
No, I don't.

00:18:57.207 --> 00:19:00.210
But it’s weird
that it hasn’t been found yet.

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:01.778
Mom must've taken it and ran off.

00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:04.014
Or she may have hidden it somewhere.

00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:08.752
-Let me in your unit.
-Hell no.

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:10.721
I just need some cash.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:13.457
The police already searched
the entire place.

00:19:13.523 --> 00:19:16.326
Then what’s the problem?
I just want to check for myself.

00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:19.229
I just don’t like strangers
going inside my house.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.398
What stranger?

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:23.767
You stopped being my dad, didn’t you?

00:19:25.602 --> 00:19:29.439
I still think of myself as your dad.

00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:30.674
Oh, shut up.

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:33.076
Stop contacting me too.

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:46.823
Thank you. Welcome.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.592
Here.

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:49.793
Will it work?

00:19:57.734 --> 00:19:59.970
Do you have something to prove your age?

00:20:00.737 --> 00:20:02.205
I forgot to bring it with me.

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:04.241
That totally failed, huh?

00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:07.311
Hey, Hotaru?

00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:13.050
What's wrong?

00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:15.085
-I'm buying this.
-Huh?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.322
-Welcome.
-Here.

00:20:18.388 --> 00:20:19.489
‎TRUE ‎MIRIN

00:20:20.223 --> 00:20:22.159
Do you have something to prove your age?

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.663
True mirin contains alcohol,
so it can’t be sold to anyone under 20.

00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:28.398
No way.

00:20:29.032 --> 00:20:31.368
SAKUTA'S HOUSE VIEWING DATE

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:37.607
Sock?

00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:40.677
Yeah. It fell behind the washing machine.
The Santa-patterned one.

00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:44.614
Also, your mail is still coming here.

00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:46.416
Haven’t you set up forwarding?

00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:49.619
-Nope.
-I'll send them to you. Where do you live?

00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:51.288
I've got no address.

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:53.557
-Huh?
-I’m sleeping in my car.

00:20:54.057 --> 00:20:55.359
You what?

00:20:55.425 --> 00:20:56.626
Yeah.

00:20:56.693 --> 00:20:59.863
But it’s been two to three months
since you left.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.199
I’ll let you know when I find a place!

00:21:03.433 --> 00:21:04.668
Okay.

00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:05.569
Well then.

00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.437
SAKUTA

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:16.446
Was this on purpose?

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:28.725
Do you live in this apartment?

00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:29.926
Yeah, I guess.

00:21:29.993 --> 00:21:32.696
Do you know who lives
in the second-floor apartment?

00:21:32.763 --> 00:21:33.663
Or when they'll be back?

00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:36.299
Not really.

00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:37.200
I see.

00:21:40.904 --> 00:21:42.172
-Ran away from home?
-What?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.676
I get it. I really do.
Guys don’t have a place at home.

00:21:46.743 --> 00:21:48.945
That’s when you just retreat to the car.

00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:51.782
Well…

00:21:51.848 --> 00:21:53.917
Anyway, I’ll just be there waiting.

00:21:59.723 --> 00:22:01.958
-I can’t wait to be an adult!
-I know!

00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:03.693
I can then buy true mirin.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.629
You really wanted that?

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:07.397
What’ll you do first as an adult?

00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:08.365
Drink alcohol.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:09.433
Seriously?

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:11.868
I'M WAITING AT YOUR APARTMENT - DAD

00:22:14.871 --> 00:22:15.739
What's wrong?

00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:19.242
It's nothing.

00:22:55.178 --> 00:22:57.280
Ouch…

00:23:00.484 --> 00:23:01.718
It's me.

00:23:01.785 --> 00:23:02.752
Coming.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.489
-Good morning.
-I'm back.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.958
You just came back?

00:23:08.024 --> 00:23:09.926
Mr. Sakuta has already woken up.

00:23:10.594 --> 00:23:12.829
Hey, where were you?

00:23:14.498 --> 00:23:15.565
Toyoko?

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.535
Is everything okay?
Isn't that place dangerous?

00:23:19.102 --> 00:23:20.270
I never asked.

00:23:20.971 --> 00:23:23.406
I never asked you to worry
or make me meals.

00:23:23.473 --> 00:23:25.375
Stop acting on your own and getting mad.

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:27.611
What?

00:23:29.179 --> 00:23:31.515
Did any suspicious person come by?

00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:33.350
Suspicious person?

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.285
Never mind.

00:23:36.253 --> 00:23:37.954
I’ll head back to my room soon.

00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:47.163
UNIFORM

00:23:49.432 --> 00:23:51.902
TOMOE KUSUNOKI EMBEZZLEMENT WITNESS

00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:54.170
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR THOSE KEYWORDS

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:02.879
-Sakuta.
-Yes?

00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:06.616
Being a parent… It’s hard.

00:24:07.183 --> 00:24:09.119
Whether I make her meals
or worry about her,

00:24:10.253 --> 00:24:12.155
she said it’s none of my business.

00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:15.759
Oh, that’s exactly what I imagined.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.794
What?

00:24:17.861 --> 00:24:18.929
Of a parent-child fight.

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:23.567
‎Really?

00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:27.837
Ah, sorry for the wait.
I’ll unlock it now.

00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:28.838
Thank you.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:30.874
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

00:24:32.108 --> 00:24:33.343
Are you siblings?

00:24:34.277 --> 00:24:36.446
-No.
-Friends?

00:24:36.513 --> 00:24:38.682
Two people might find it a bit small.

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:40.617
Oh, no. I’m just accompanying him.

00:24:41.184 --> 00:24:43.286
This is Mr. Sakuta,
the one interested in the unit.

00:24:43.353 --> 00:24:44.821
Oh, sorry about that.

00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:46.289
Feel free to look around.

00:24:46.923 --> 00:24:48.758
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:24:49.392 --> 00:24:52.228
It’s about 30 square meters.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.665
It’s an old place,

00:24:55.732 --> 00:24:57.434
but it’s been renovated a few times,

00:24:58.068 --> 00:24:59.736
so the bath and kitchen areas are clean.

00:24:59.803 --> 00:25:00.937
Oh, you're right.

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:05.442
It's nice that it’s got a dryer.

00:25:05.508 --> 00:25:06.810
Isn't that the best?

00:25:07.477 --> 00:25:10.113
The kitchen faces the entrance,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.548
so you may find it a bit cramped.

00:25:12.148 --> 00:25:13.116
Well…

00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:15.452
I mostly eat out, so it's totally fine.

00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:17.854
Yeah, no problem at all.

00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:18.989
That's great to hear.

00:25:24.427 --> 00:25:27.030
This is apparently
the landlord’s favorite color.

00:25:27.931 --> 00:25:29.566
It's quite unique, to say the least.

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:31.835
Yeah, a little, isn’t it?

00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:33.670
That’s a nice color!

00:25:33.737 --> 00:25:34.971
Yeah, yeah, really nice.

00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:35.905
Which is it?

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.779
I think it’s very cute.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.683
I find it a bit unsettling.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.851
Right.

00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:52.022
The room in the back
is the only one that has tatami flooring.

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:54.591
Oh, tatami!

00:25:54.658 --> 00:25:56.359
Ah, sorry.

00:25:56.426 --> 00:25:57.927
-One moment.
-Sure.

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:03.733
Tatami, huh?

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:06.002
Isn't tatami nice?

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.005
My parents' home had tatami flooring.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.307
Back then,

00:26:11.374 --> 00:26:14.711
I envied my friends'
shiny hardwood floors,

00:26:14.778 --> 00:26:15.879
but in the end,

00:26:15.945 --> 00:26:18.915
it’s just so comforting.
The smell and all.

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:19.883
Is it a detached house?

00:26:19.949 --> 00:26:21.084
Yep.

00:26:21.618 --> 00:26:23.653
-Was it a "clamp"?
-What?

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.923
I was wondering if using the house
as a clamp actually worked.

00:26:27.724 --> 00:26:29.826
My dad and mom are still together.

00:26:29.893 --> 00:26:32.529
Whether it’s thanks to the house,
I’m not sure, though.

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:33.663
Okay.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.800
What was your parents' home like, Sakuta?

00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:42.038
It had lots of rooms.
I guess it was a lively place.

00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:44.407
Oh, so you had, like, a big family?

00:26:44.474 --> 00:26:46.142
No, I grew up in a facility.

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:48.211
I didn't have parents
ever since I was born.

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:50.647
I was raised in a nursery,

00:26:50.714 --> 00:26:52.749
then I went straight to an orphanage.

00:26:53.983 --> 00:26:55.185
It was fun.

00:26:55.985 --> 00:26:58.421
I had many close friends,

00:26:59.222 --> 00:27:00.957
and the food was amazing.

00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:02.959
Um…

00:27:04.194 --> 00:27:05.428
You've been through a lot, huh?

00:27:05.495 --> 00:27:06.629
Not really.

00:27:07.363 --> 00:27:08.765
Everyone's been through stuff, no?

00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:11.935
Hotaru, and even you, Hatano.

00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:14.137
My situation is nothing special.

00:27:14.871 --> 00:27:16.973
Me? I didn't really…

00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:22.345
What's the matter?

00:27:23.613 --> 00:27:26.049
There's people flirting out there.

00:27:28.017 --> 00:27:30.820
If we can see their flirting from here,

00:27:30.887 --> 00:27:33.223
that means the flirting on this side

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:35.091
can be seen by them too, right?

00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:38.194
What, do you have plans to flirt?

00:27:43.933 --> 00:27:46.002
I wonder how we look
from their point of view.

00:27:47.003 --> 00:27:47.837
Huh?

00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:49.038
The two of us.

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:50.440
Even earlier,

00:27:50.507 --> 00:27:52.842
we were mistaken for siblings and friends.

00:27:55.345 --> 00:27:57.881
If a guy and a girl are together,
people just assume

00:27:57.947 --> 00:27:59.916
they’re a couple, right?

00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:02.652
So, why is it different for two guys?

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:04.954
But we’re not actually dating.

00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:07.957
Well, yeah. That’s true,

00:28:08.024 --> 00:28:11.494
but I can’t help feeling a little jealous.

00:28:18.434 --> 00:28:19.969
The door color…

00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:22.806
It's starting to look kind of cute now.

00:28:30.046 --> 00:28:32.582
Sorry for the wait. How’s it looking?

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:35.251
-Oh, sorry. I wanted to ask…
-Yes?

00:28:35.318 --> 00:28:38.888
About the security deposit…

00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:45.628
HIGH SCHOOL PAMPHLET

00:29:02.078 --> 00:29:03.413
-Hey.
-What the?

00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:04.747
Can I come in for a sec?

00:29:04.814 --> 00:29:05.682
No.

00:29:05.748 --> 00:29:08.318
I just want to check if the money
is in there or not.

00:29:08.384 --> 00:29:09.219
Please leave.

00:29:09.285 --> 00:29:10.820
Come on. It'll be quick.

00:29:11.788 --> 00:29:13.623
-Leave!
-Be quiet.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.959
-Leave!
-Hey, let me in, will you?

00:29:16.025 --> 00:29:17.126
-Come on!
-No!

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:18.528
Hey, you! What are you doing?

00:29:19.562 --> 00:29:21.331
No, it's nothing.

00:29:21.397 --> 00:29:23.833
Use the man catcher, Kusunoki!
The one I gave you!

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.802
You're misunderstanding.
Don't raise your voice.

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:27.503
It's really nothing.

00:29:28.271 --> 00:29:29.305
Hey, that's dangerous!

00:29:29.372 --> 00:29:30.840
What's wrong with you?

00:29:31.374 --> 00:29:32.909
Hey, it's dangerous!

00:29:34.677 --> 00:29:36.012
And what's with those cries?

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.313
Stop shouting!

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.549
Hey! Stop! Ouch!

00:29:39.616 --> 00:29:41.584
-Am I doing it right?
-Ouch!

00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:43.720
Yes! What should I do?

00:29:43.786 --> 00:29:46.055
Stop going for my shank!

00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:47.090
What's your deal?

00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:50.393
Will you be looking at other places too?

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.195
I'd like to decide
after seeing a few more.

00:29:52.862 --> 00:29:53.863
Sounds good.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.365
-What should I do…?
-Huh?

00:29:56.332 --> 00:29:58.902
-What's wrong?
-Come with me, quick!

00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:00.737
Okay.

00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:06.075
Why are you like this?
I'll leave after seeing it for myself.

00:30:06.142 --> 00:30:07.911
This is Mom’s and my home!

00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:11.748
You're hiding it, right? Give me the key.

00:30:11.814 --> 00:30:13.483
-Hey!
-Coming through!

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:15.418
-Excuse me! Coming through!
-Hey!

00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:16.686
Stop this!

00:30:17.954 --> 00:30:19.589
-Hey!
-What's this?

00:30:25.028 --> 00:30:26.963
-The key.
-What?

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.765
Just pass me the key!

00:30:31.534 --> 00:30:32.835
Come on.

00:30:32.902 --> 00:30:34.103
Leave.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.306
-What's going on?
-He's a suspicious person.

00:30:36.372 --> 00:30:37.674
-Who're you calling that!
-Hey, now.

00:30:38.274 --> 00:30:39.475
What now?

00:30:39.542 --> 00:30:41.878
Um… Who may you be?

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:46.249
I'm her dad. Why?

00:30:48.017 --> 00:30:49.385
-What?
-Oh my.

00:30:50.353 --> 00:30:52.488
You know her mom's case, right?

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:54.324
Well…

00:30:55.191 --> 00:30:56.225
‎Yeah.

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:58.094
I’m looking for the stolen money.

00:30:59.128 --> 00:31:00.630
If she’s hiding it,

00:31:01.197 --> 00:31:02.899
I’ll need to report it to the police.

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:05.201
And I’m worried about her.

00:31:06.202 --> 00:31:09.238
Sorry for the ruckus.
This is a private family matter.

00:31:09.305 --> 00:31:11.074
You all can leave now.
And remove this too.

00:31:13.543 --> 00:31:14.444
Then,

00:31:15.244 --> 00:31:16.713
why didn’t you come until now?

00:31:17.347 --> 00:31:18.181
What?

00:31:18.715 --> 00:31:21.684
-You're just her neighbor, right?
-No.

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:24.787
Are you perhaps
from the child guidance center?

00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:25.989
No.

00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:27.857
Oh, then you must be her teacher.

00:31:27.924 --> 00:31:29.959
Ah, that'd be me.

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:30.860
Right.

00:31:30.927 --> 00:31:32.095
Then, you're the landlord?

00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:33.229
That'd be me.

00:31:33.296 --> 00:31:35.031
Okay. Then…

00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:40.803
I'm her dad.

00:31:42.672 --> 00:31:43.806
Huh?

00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:46.542
I'm her dad!

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.244
Huh?

00:31:50.613 --> 00:31:52.482
He's my new dad.

00:31:52.548 --> 00:31:54.784
She's right. He's her dad.

00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:56.552
Nice to meet you. I'm her dad.

00:31:58.187 --> 00:31:59.956
What kind of crap are you pulling?

00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:04.827
-I mean, you're gay, no?
-Hey!

00:32:06.295 --> 00:32:08.231
A gay person calling himself
a dad is weird.

00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:09.332
Come on!

00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:11.701
-It's not weird at all!
-Huh?

00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:14.037
What’s wrong with a gay dad?

00:32:14.103 --> 00:32:15.338
-Am I right?
-Yes.

00:32:15.872 --> 00:32:17.740
It's not weird. It's awesome.

00:32:18.741 --> 00:32:20.910
Look, we’re blood-related here.

00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:23.780
Well, I’ve been
to a parent-teacher conference,

00:32:23.846 --> 00:32:25.748
spoken to the police,

00:32:26.282 --> 00:32:28.284
eaten ice cream together, shared shishamo,

00:32:28.351 --> 00:32:30.019
miso soup and rice balls…

00:32:31.354 --> 00:32:32.688
Whether to scold her or not,

00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:34.357
I wondered about that,
and I worried for her.

00:32:35.691 --> 00:32:37.527
I've been told I didn’t have to do that,

00:32:37.593 --> 00:32:38.961
so what does that make me?

00:32:39.662 --> 00:32:40.663
Nothing, duh.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.032
I'm the one who seems
more like a parent, no?

00:32:43.099 --> 00:32:44.267
Yes, you very much do!

00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:45.334
Isn't that right?

00:32:45.968 --> 00:32:47.170
What?

00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:49.405
That's not the point here.

00:32:49.472 --> 00:32:52.075
Then what is?
This kind of stuff matters, right?

00:32:53.276 --> 00:32:55.578
So, you’re after the 30 million too?

00:32:55.645 --> 00:32:56.746
Too?

00:32:56.813 --> 00:32:59.248
You guys are in on it too?

00:33:00.016 --> 00:33:01.717
Planning to split it all, huh?

00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:03.586
That's not it.

00:33:03.653 --> 00:33:06.089
Then what's the deal?
You’re a teacher, right?

00:33:06.155 --> 00:33:07.890
You're letting this guy do what he wants?

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:12.862
Okay, I'm calling the police.

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:13.796
Huh?

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.498
-What?
-Um…

00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:18.334
Wait, please!

00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:24.140
Fine.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.243
Give me the key,
and I won’t call the police.

00:33:32.882 --> 00:33:33.749
Huh?

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:37.386
Whatever. Look as much as you want.

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:38.287
But…

00:33:38.921 --> 00:33:40.456
It's for your sake, Dad.

00:33:40.523 --> 00:33:42.625
-What did I say?
-I'm not referring to you.

00:33:43.226 --> 00:33:44.460
It's him I'm talking about.

00:33:46.262 --> 00:33:47.363
Is that so?

00:33:53.836 --> 00:33:54.670
Will it be alright?

00:33:54.737 --> 00:33:55.905
Sorry about this.

00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:57.373
You sure about this?

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.409
There’s no money in my unit anyway.

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:05.114
In other words, it's somewhere else?

00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.382
Is that true?

00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:10.052
So, that person earlier was Jin Ichigaya?

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:15.057
You’ve been lying all this time?

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.594
Can both of you

00:34:19.362 --> 00:34:23.299
give me some explanation?

00:34:48.224 --> 00:34:49.825
What the hell?

00:34:55.464 --> 00:34:57.400
CHASU

00:34:57.466 --> 00:34:59.335
CHAN

00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:03.272
What do I do with this?

00:35:04.407 --> 00:35:06.609
PARTY A: HOTARU KUSUNOKI
PARTY B: GENICHI HATANO

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:07.743
PARENT-CHILD CONTRACT

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.046
Parent-Child Contract?

00:35:10.112 --> 00:35:12.415
Landlady, were you aware of this too?

00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:16.819
Yeah. About pretending to be her parent.

00:35:17.453 --> 00:35:18.788
The 30 million yen though…

00:35:19.755 --> 00:35:20.656
surprised me.

00:35:32.268 --> 00:35:33.402
Dang it!

00:35:33.469 --> 00:35:35.404
BANKBOOK

00:35:39.008 --> 00:35:40.276
Found nothing, right?

00:35:40.843 --> 00:35:42.478
Please don’t ever come back again.

00:35:44.247 --> 00:35:45.448
Remember, I'm your dad.

00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:48.117
Are you hungry, by any chance?

00:35:48.184 --> 00:35:49.051
Huh?

00:35:49.118 --> 00:35:52.221
Hunger can make you do bad things.
Like crows.

00:35:52.855 --> 00:35:54.323
Don’t compare me to them!

00:35:55.992 --> 00:35:57.093
Bye!

00:36:02.064 --> 00:36:04.133
-Has your dad left?
-Yes.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.905
What, the cash is in there?

00:36:15.778 --> 00:36:16.812
Well…

00:36:16.879 --> 00:36:19.148
It's not really what I expected.

00:36:19.215 --> 00:36:20.683
I imagined gold coins.

00:36:21.484 --> 00:36:24.086
Okay, you can put that away now.

00:36:24.153 --> 00:36:25.354
Okay.

00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:29.458
The man catcher…

00:36:30.092 --> 00:36:32.161
I'll prepare more of them.

00:36:32.962 --> 00:36:34.063
Have a good rest.

00:36:45.508 --> 00:36:46.342
Here.

00:36:51.013 --> 00:36:52.448
Sorry about this.

00:36:53.816 --> 00:36:56.319
-What?
-I made you lie.

00:36:57.053 --> 00:36:59.322
It's not really your fault.

00:37:00.756 --> 00:37:03.059
I don’t have parents,

00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:04.627
and I like guys.

00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:05.728
Huh?

00:37:05.795 --> 00:37:08.364
I used to make up fake parents
and fake girlfriends

00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:09.999
and tell my friends about them.

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:13.336
Then, it got exhausting.

00:37:14.704 --> 00:37:18.007
I even kept a notebook
to keep my lies consistent.

00:37:19.975 --> 00:37:20.843
But…

00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:25.348
I lost track of what I said to who,
and everything started falling apart.

00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:27.783
So, I just stopped hiding it.

00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:30.920
But at school…

00:37:31.754 --> 00:37:33.356
no one knows, right?

00:37:34.156 --> 00:37:37.526
I’m not hiding it,
I just choose who I tell.

00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:39.862
I see.

00:37:41.464 --> 00:37:43.432
So, I'm sorry.

00:37:45.034 --> 00:37:47.169
I get how hard it is
to keep up appearances.

00:37:48.437 --> 00:37:50.239
So, Mr. Hatano knows too?

00:37:51.006 --> 00:37:52.808
Yeah.

00:37:55.044 --> 00:37:57.580
Why did you ask for Hatano's help?

00:37:57.646 --> 00:37:58.481
Huh?

00:37:59.348 --> 00:38:01.050
Is it because he lives here too?

00:38:03.352 --> 00:38:05.421
Or is it because he's gay?

00:38:10.025 --> 00:38:11.894
I thought he's similar.

00:38:12.628 --> 00:38:13.562
What do you mean?

00:38:14.363 --> 00:38:15.431
His looks?

00:38:19.368 --> 00:38:20.669
How he's doing his best.

00:38:32.782 --> 00:38:35.951
Mr. Sakuta said he's got the gist of it,
so he'll think it over.

00:38:36.652 --> 00:38:37.653
Think what over?

00:38:39.121 --> 00:38:41.757
I also heard he didn't have parents
and that he's gay.

00:38:42.958 --> 00:38:44.960
-From Sakuta?
-Yes.

00:38:47.863 --> 00:38:50.332
Right, dinner.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.702
The cat's already out of the bag,
so I'm returning to my unit.

00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:54.837
Oh, okay.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.974
But…

00:39:00.743 --> 00:39:02.545
-As my current dad,
-Yes?

00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:04.213
I've got a favor to ask of you.

00:39:07.383 --> 00:39:08.417
Welcome.

00:39:08.484 --> 00:39:09.218
TRUE MIRIN

00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:10.119
Here.

00:39:12.755 --> 00:39:14.190
I’m with my dad today.

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:18.427
Hi.

00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:23.332
451 yen, please.

00:39:23.399 --> 00:39:24.733
Glad you could buy it!

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.602
You did it!

00:39:26.669 --> 00:39:30.306
Yay!

00:39:30.372 --> 00:39:32.174
Though, that's a little unfair.

00:39:32.241 --> 00:39:33.375
COFFEE TO GO

00:39:33.442 --> 00:39:35.211
We'll be going first.

00:39:35.277 --> 00:39:37.179
Having a parent is convenient after all.

00:39:37.246 --> 00:39:39.348
How nice to be you.
It does seem convenient.

00:39:40.015 --> 00:39:41.884
Can you pretend to be my dad too?

00:39:41.951 --> 00:39:42.885
What?

00:39:42.952 --> 00:39:44.553
I'm just joking.

00:39:45.754 --> 00:39:47.256
Hey, you don't have a dad?

00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:50.793
I do, but it's, like, better
if he’s not around.

00:39:52.595 --> 00:39:53.662
Wanna keep playing?

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.232
Nah. I’m heading home. See you.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.302
TRUE MIRIN

00:40:01.136 --> 00:40:03.939
Hey, is that your mom’s secret ingredient?

00:40:04.673 --> 00:40:06.275
Yes, that's right.

00:40:06.876 --> 00:40:08.644
Hey, are you always hanging out here?

00:40:10.045 --> 00:40:11.313
This place is awful, isn’t it?

00:40:11.814 --> 00:40:12.681
Huh?

00:40:12.748 --> 00:40:14.717
It's dirty and scary.

00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:17.353
But somehow, it mattered to me.

00:40:17.987 --> 00:40:20.489
I kept wondering why.

00:40:20.556 --> 00:40:21.457
Uh-huh.

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:23.292
And maybe it's because I chose it myself.

00:40:28.864 --> 00:40:29.765
I see.

00:40:35.804 --> 00:40:38.407
TRUE MIRIN

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:46.181
After the beep tone,

00:40:46.248 --> 00:40:48.951
please leave your name and message.

00:40:49.652 --> 00:40:51.153
Hello, Mom?

00:40:51.887 --> 00:40:54.590
I need to start deciding on my future.

00:40:54.657 --> 00:40:56.492
Like, which high school to go to.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.395
Choosing is hard, isn't it?

00:40:59.461 --> 00:41:01.363
Even stuff like what goes in my rice ball

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.766
or who I tell my secrets to.

00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:05.267
It’s really tough.

00:41:06.201 --> 00:41:07.436
Coming.

00:41:07.503 --> 00:41:08.671
-But…
-Yes?

00:41:08.737 --> 00:41:10.239
I’ll do my best to choose carefully.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.543
So I can take care
of everything around me.

00:41:16.278 --> 00:41:18.581
Starting with
today’s miso soup ingredients.

00:41:21.116 --> 00:41:22.918
Talk to you soon. Bye.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.854
Let's taste test!

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:38.000
‎YAMANASHI GRAPE JUICE, OKAYAMA GRAPE JUICE

00:41:38.067 --> 00:41:38.968
It's a draw.

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:48.844
Excuse me!

00:41:48.911 --> 00:41:49.812
Yes?

00:41:49.878 --> 00:41:51.714
Sorry.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.681
Uh…

00:41:53.282 --> 00:41:54.917
The day before yesterday,

00:41:54.984 --> 00:41:58.787
or maybe the day before that, I think,
I sent a letter to Tokyo.

00:41:58.854 --> 00:42:00.756
-Right.
-Has it arrived by any chance?

00:42:00.823 --> 00:42:03.726
Normally, it should be there by now.

00:42:04.593 --> 00:42:05.427
Is that right?

00:42:05.494 --> 00:42:07.363
Did you send it out by mistake, perhaps?

00:42:07.429 --> 00:42:08.330
Why do you ask?

00:42:08.397 --> 00:42:10.099
You sound like you wished
it wasn't sent out.

00:42:10.165 --> 00:42:12.334
Ah, no…

00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:13.068
‎TAMOTSU’S LITTLE GIFT SHOP

00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:13.969
I’m not sure.

00:42:15.537 --> 00:42:16.972
Maybe I did send it to the wrong place.

00:42:19.308 --> 00:42:21.677
I honestly don’t know myself too.

00:42:26.248 --> 00:42:27.950
-I thought about it,
-Uh-huh.

00:42:28.517 --> 00:42:31.420
and honestly, I don’t know what to do.

00:42:31.487 --> 00:42:32.621
Right.

00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:34.490
Why did you pretend to be her parent?

00:42:34.556 --> 00:42:35.557
Huh?

00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:39.795
I mean, there are the police,
the child guidance center, and so on.

00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:42.264
There are many places out there
to support Hotaru.

00:42:42.865 --> 00:42:46.802
And yet, you still went out of your way
to act as her dad.

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:48.170
I really don’t get it.

00:42:50.305 --> 00:42:52.141
Are you in it for the money?

00:42:52.207 --> 00:42:53.876
-What?
-The 30 million yen.

00:42:53.942 --> 00:42:56.412
Oh, not at all. I don't know if that money

00:42:56.478 --> 00:42:57.613
was from embezzlement, but…

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.548
I'm sure it's meant for Hotaru.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.351
Then…

00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:05.354
is there another reason?

00:43:06.088 --> 00:43:08.524
Because I was asked to pretend
to be her parent.

00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:11.193
Do you do everything someone asks?

00:43:12.394 --> 00:43:13.228
She was in a fix.

00:43:13.996 --> 00:43:16.165
-Are you always like this?
-What?

00:43:16.231 --> 00:43:18.067
This is not the first time
this has happened.

00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:19.635
Whether it's using a house as a clamp,

00:43:19.702 --> 00:43:21.437
introducing me to this place,

00:43:21.503 --> 00:43:22.471
or finding an apartment--

00:43:22.538 --> 00:43:24.940
That's… different.

00:43:25.007 --> 00:43:25.908
How so?

00:43:28.944 --> 00:43:31.246
That's because I was worried.

00:43:32.748 --> 00:43:36.318
Yeah, because I was in a fix, right?

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:37.219
Oh, no.

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:39.788
That's not exactly it.

00:43:39.855 --> 00:43:41.056
Then, what is it?

00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:44.760
Look…

00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:46.895
I won't know if you don't tell.

00:43:48.897 --> 00:43:50.299
I like you.

00:43:52.534 --> 00:43:53.802
Sorry, what?

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:54.870
I said…

00:43:57.172 --> 00:43:58.240
I like you!

00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:04.379
Huh?

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.449
