Senior.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.570
You've spent all these years

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.620
practicing martial arts, huh?

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.900
To save lives,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.410
a physician must know how to protect himself first.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.660
Senior.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.940
What a pity. You're being naive.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.060
Senior, oh, senior.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.060
I never thought

Come.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.130
Let's go to the lantern festival.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.220
Why has this courtyard

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.430
been quiet

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.260
since Su Muyu's departure?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.450
Where is that cheerful daughter of mine?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.060
I just think

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.820
Su Muyu

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.730
tends to overthink

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.890
and keep things to himself.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.290
And he's fine

making himself mentally exhausted.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.500
Compared to Su Changhe,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.060
Su Muyu isn't half bad.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.610
You could figure out what's on Su Muyu's mind,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.030
but you would never do the same

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.170

My silly daughter.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.020
You're never meant to be.

The Blood River remains

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.370
unacceptable in this world.

It's not that they don't see you as a friend.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.660
It's just that...

when they're in danger.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.100
There, there.

Don't be sad.

After all,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.170
the idea of Master Mu paying the Wangchengshan Sect a visit

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.100
sounds rather frightening.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.780
Turns out Master Mu

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.850
is a young lad.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.660
Looks like

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.660

I don't think we're friends yet.

There's no telling what.

Death Summons, huh?

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.620
Is this how the Tang Clan

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.540
entertains a guest?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.050
Since this is your turf,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.910
why must you

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.290
hide your faces

Where is Tang Linghuang?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.460
He agreed to see us.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.660
Even if he left the city to greet us in advance,

why isn't he here?

that I'm less than him?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.020

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.580
How pathetic.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.850
Pathetic?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.730
My family has practiced dark arts for years.

her poisoning technique to such an exquisite state.

It's more than that.

You're from the Blood River,

And they're immune to all poisons.

That's a Death-Chasing Serpent.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.370
It's very popular here in Jin City.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.900
They drink tea and play mahjong,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.870
or pull up a stool

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.450
and gather around for a "Dragon Gate Array" session.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.730
That's daily life for the people of Jin City.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.610
Dragon Gate Array?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.610
Is that some powerful formation?

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.010
Well, you could say that.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.500
Their posture when gathered together

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.510
looks just like General Xue of the old dynasty

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.850
when he encircled the northern tribes.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.380
But with Tang Clan guarding inside Jin City

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.700
and Wangchengshan Sect defending the outside,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.300
peace has reigned for years.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.790
Why would Jin City folk

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.370
need to set up any "Dragon Gate Array"?

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.180
It's just a saying.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.340
They just gather to gossip

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.460
about whatever's been happening lately.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.220
So basically, they're just bragging together.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.420
Su Muyu.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.940
Why is it that I'm the one asking questions,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.100
and you're answering them?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.700
Have we switched roles all of a sudden?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.490
Wasn't it you

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.530
who always knew nothing

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.580
about stuff?

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.770
Back then, to deal with a powerful enemy,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.650
I stayed in Jin City for three whole months.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.770
So I got to know this place quite well.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.980
Mahjong!

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.730
That means you've won, right?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.340
Of course I have.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.700
[Lei Yunhe, Lei Clan]
128 points in total! Pay up!

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.820
That's sheer luck, brat.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.850
Come on, again!

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.220
Still playing?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.060
Who are you? We're in a game!

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.130
We have no time to entertain you.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.580
Master Mu.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.490
You brat!

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.460
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.890
Is he insulting me?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.010
That's the slang here.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.610
He was just greeting you warmly.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:01.980
How funny.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.530
This gentleman sure is full of humor.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.130
Brat.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.100
If you hadn't sounded so sincere,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.420
I'd have thought you were provoking me.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.180
Master Mu.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.300
Is that how you greet people here?

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.700
Patriarch and Master Su.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.100
Why didn't you inform me of your presence here

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.980
in advance?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.490
I could have made preparations early.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.980
This friend of mine

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.300
stayed in Jin City for three months then.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.890
You were the one who hosted him, weren't you?

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.220
Yes.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.250
Yes, yes.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.220
So you taught him to greet people

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.820
by calling them brat?

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.180
Well...

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.980
Well...

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.120
[Master Mu, Jin City Mole]
I was only joking

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.980
with Master Su.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.440
I didn't expect Master Su

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.130
would take it seriously.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.390
After that, I...

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.220
I...

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.370
I didn't explain it.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.010
No wonder Liu Yilong seemed so furious

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.100
when I was having a duel with him

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.730
then.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.060
That's actually an insult, huh?

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.060
Pardon me, I...

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.130
Because you always acted like

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.370
a polite assassin?

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.370
You even greet people before killing them.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.340
I bet Liu Yilong was so mad

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.700
that he couldn't even hold his sword well

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.180
when you called him that.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.650
That's enough.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.610
All right, I'll stop laughing.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.420
You mood changes faster than the weather here in Jin City.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.130
Master Mu.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.420
Yes, sir.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.340
You said we came

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.340
without notice.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.530
I was wrong.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.420
Patriarch, Master Su.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.100
With your status,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.220
you can come and go as you please.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.770
Why would you inform me of it?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.890
That was a slip of the tongue.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.850
That was a slip of the tongue.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.420
I misspoke.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.250
No.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.650
What I mean is

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.940
I already told you so long ago.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.330
In fact,

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.900
they've been waiting here

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.900
for us too.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.140

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.010
Who?

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.810
One is Mu Xuewei.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.180
Poisonous Blossom?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.980
As the other one,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.020
you haven't met him

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.930
after years of being stationed here in Jin City.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.870
However,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.360
he's now your family head.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.490
And that's Mu Qingyang.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.460
Well...

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.050
You haven't seen them before?

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.490
I swear.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.940
I really haven't seen them.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.530
If Mu family head

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:33.770
ever came to my teahouse,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.090
how could I not know?

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.380
The situation looks bad.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.420
I'd say it's very bad.

Where is Yumo?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.510
Before entering the city,

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.570
she was still with us.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.140
Yumo

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.660
went ahead of us

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.530
and infiltrated the Tang Clan.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.050
She infiltrated the Tang Clan?

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.220
They say Tang Fort is nothing but dangerous.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.570

Are you threatening me?

You asked who I am.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.570

like me

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.490
could have seized his personal weapon

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.220
by force, do you?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.250
But...

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.660
Mistress.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.900
My master has been in seclusion lately.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.420
Even I haven't seen him for a long time.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.010
Seclusion?

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.980
After entering the Lianyue Pavilion,

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.000
he hasn't come out since then.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.070
Martial Uncle said

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.010
that he went into seclusion to cultivate.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:16.860
Right there.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.660
He's in seclusion because he doesn't know I'm here.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.290
He'll show himself

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.490
if I go to him.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.730
That won't do, Mistress.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.880
There are two inner-hall martial uncles guarding outside the Lianyue Pavilion.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.380
They're always strict when it comes to that,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.530
even though you're close to Master.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.090
I've asked to see Master several times,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.940
but I was always turned away.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.980
Is that so?

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.460
Mistress!

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.570
Mistress.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.420
There's certainly something off

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:52.570
about Uncle Fulu and Uncle Tianlu.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.090
What do you mean?

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.420
By seniority, those two

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.010
are considered Master's elders.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.460
Why would they be guarding for him?

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.730
Only one of them did that.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.380
Now both of them are here...

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.010
Could it be

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.050
that Master...

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.570
I'll go check on it.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.660
Mistress!

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.700
Who's there?

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.380
Uncle Tianlu.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.090
You're here too, Uncle Fulu.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.050
It's you, Tang Lian.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.810
Can't sleep again?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.700
I'm missing my master,

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:41.770
so I'm here to have a look.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.420
Your master is in seclusion.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.090
Looks like

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.140
this seclusion of his

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.860
is truly important.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.700
Martial Uncles, thank you

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.860
for staying up to guard him.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.220
Fulu.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.490
There was some noise above just now.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:01.860
I'll go check on it.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.620
What is he trying to do?

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.810
Stop!

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.490
This is…

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:43.940
Tang Lianyue.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.250
Master!

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.940
Master.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.220
How could this be?

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.220
This is…

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.700
Who are you?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.660
Go!

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.700
Get help!

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.980
You must wait for my return.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.380
No.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.250
Why not?

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.980
No matter

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.220
how gifted the brat is,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.570
he's as temperamental as his master.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.570
Now

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.530
he already knows his master is trapped by us.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:48.660
We can't let him live.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.770
Hold on.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.460
Only he and Tang Linghuang know

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.180
where the hidden weapons vault is.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.260
Before we figure that out,

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.460
Madam won't let us kill him.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.460
Tang Lian is his only disciple

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.220
as well as his weakness.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.050
Tianlu.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.980
Lock him up

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.940
somewhere for now.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.520
I'll go report to Madam

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.460
about what just happened.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.860
I'm back.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.940
Well,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.940
what did you find?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.860
I snuck into the Tang Clan

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.330
and ran into Tang Lianyue's young disciple,

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.900
Tang Lian.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.490
Only then did I learn

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.620
that Tang Lianyue has been trapped in the Lianyue Pavilion.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.770
To protect me,

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.770
Tang Lian was caught

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.530
by Tang Tianlu and Tang Fulu.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.090
We must go back and rescue them.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.220
Don't panic, Yumo.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.700
Tell me more about it.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.260
Some unknown thing

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.630
has frozen Tang Lianyue solid.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.620
Within three chi,

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.310
no living thing can approach me.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.700
It's the Frostmoon Cocoon.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.900
Miss Bai ever brought that up.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.140
It's extremely rare,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.560
but it can instantly freeze

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.480
even a master.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.130
However, it doesn't last forever.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.420
Perhaps they're there every day to replenish its effect,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.070
keeping Tang Lianyue under control long-term.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.530
As for why they don't kill him,

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.290
maybe they need

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.250
something from him.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.700
Maybe

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.180
Qingyang and Xuewei

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.700
are inside the Tang Clan too.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.330
Has something happened

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.770
to Qingyang and Xuewei?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.660
Yes.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.010
The Tang Clan

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.250
is truly a hostile place.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.980
Although it's dangerous,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.290
we must enter the Tang Clan again.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.010
However, we need

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.180
to come up with a thorough plan first.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.840
Those we sent to Jin City

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.940
haven't returned yet?

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.860
No.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.420
We've lost contact

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.540
with both the new envoys

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.220
and the disciples stationed in Jin City.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.220
We could still send Xuanwu Guardian missives then.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.980
Now, even that's impossible.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.530
So we believe

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.940
something major

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.810
is about to happen in Jin City.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.010
If that's the case,

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.860
it must be tied to the Tang Clan.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.180
What happens in the Tang Clan is a martial affair.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.660
It has little to do with the Baixiao Hall.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.660
Yet

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.180
Tang Lianyue

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.380
from the Tang Clan

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.380
is my close friend.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.660
He's a man of principle,

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.490
so why hasn't he returned to Tianqi City

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.010
to report in a long time?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.900
If the Tang Clan changes,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.860
the entire martial world will change.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.460
Any word from the Blood River?

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.250
Su Changhe, Su Muyu, and the rest

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.860
are already in Jin City.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.140
However, we haven't heard from them

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.700
since then.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.140
Just relying on the Blood River

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.460
won't put my mind at ease.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.620
We need to send

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.660
someone capable and reliable

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.810
to the Tang Clan.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.120
[Tang Clan is in turmoil.]

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.340
[Second City Lord, please go check on it on Guardian Azure Dragon's behalf. Ji.]

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.810
What a hassle.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.010
It's been days.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.570
These Tang Clan men just won't give up.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.770
Could it be

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.460
this is where my life ends?

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.490
Go.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.010
If there are any Blood River disciples in Jin City,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.220
come to my rescue!

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.180
He's over there!

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.140
Give chase!

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.730
Looks like you're here

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.700
after being chased by your enemy.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.770
Are you

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.420
from the Wangchengshan Sect?

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.530
Wangchengshan Sect?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.290
Do I look like a Taoist to you?

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.810
Li.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.250
Do I look like one?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.810
Mister.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.050
Saving a life

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.490
is a sacred act.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.380
I have many rare treasures,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.530
and I can trade them with you.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.940
I'm not interested in that.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.530
Just tell me

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.380
who your enemy is.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.290
It's the Tang Clan.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.490
Tang Clan?

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:10.770
You're in luck.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.730
I won't ask your name

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.730
or where you're from.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.250
If the Tang Clan wants you dead,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.090
I'll save you.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.180
Get on.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.090
Where do you think you're running?

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.660
Thunder shakes the heavens and earth.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.050
One strike splits the sky for ninety thousand miles!

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.250
Thank you for saving me.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.940
Aren't you curious why I saved you

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.690
at the mention of the Tang Clan?

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.140
If you don't want to tell me,

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.180
I won't ask you.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.620
Asking too many questions brings trouble

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.940
in this martial world.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.220
You're a wise man.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.940
My surname's Lei.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.770
Lei...

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.290
Lei?

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.810
Lei as in Lei Fortress?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.330
That's right.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.570
The Lei Fortress

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.900
never gets along with the Tang Clan.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.380
Causing them trouble now and then

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.010
sounds fun to me.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.700
You're their enemy,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.620
so I saved you.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.490
You saved the right man, then.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.290
If I make it out alive this time,

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.250
I'll be sure to give them some trouble

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.330
to repay your kindness.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.580
[Refined Brew, Serene Mind]

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.380
Those are Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.980
Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies...

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.220
That must be Master Mu.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.220
Yes.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.180
Only Master Mu

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.700
can summon Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.810
When one appears,

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.220
the underworld gates open

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.460
and ten thousand butterflies follow.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.980
Mu Qingyang resorted to this Soul-Calling Paper Butterfly.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.140
Looks like

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.290
he...

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.090
That's good news.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.090
Mu Qingyang is still alive.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.460
But the bad news is

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.660
Mu Qingyang

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.250
is about to perish.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.220
Let it lead us there.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.460
Sure.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.700
Wait for me here.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.420
May I know your name, mister?

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.530
I must remember

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.810
the favor you've shown me.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.900
My name is Lei Yunhe.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.530
It's the Twin Cranes of Lei Clan.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:18.770
I've heard of you.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.620
What an honor.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.730
I have some business to attend to,

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.290
so I must go now.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.940
I hope you

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.140
will cause them trouble

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.570
as promised.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.810
Li.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.180
Let's go.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.010
What an interesting man.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.980
The Umbrella Ghost of the Blood River.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.650
Who would've thought

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.090
I'd run into you here?

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.460
Elder Tang Tianlu of the Tang Clan.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.460
We've met before.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.210
Is this how

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.460
the Tang Clan

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.570
greet its guests?

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.090
Who would ever mistake the Umbrella Ghost of the Blood River

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.300
for a guest?

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.210
It's said

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.260
that you often appear

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.570
on cold, rainy nights.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.050
Like how an underworld reaper

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:53.900
or a wandering soul would do.
