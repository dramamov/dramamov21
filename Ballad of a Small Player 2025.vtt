01:20.208 --> 01:21.583
Fuck.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.125
My name is Doyle.

01:53.625 --> 01:55.375
Lord Doyle.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.208
I'm a high roller on a slippery slope.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.375
A gambler with a pair of lucky gloves.

02:10.416 --> 02:12.666
Washed up on the shores of Macau.

02:14.958 --> 02:17.083
The gambling capital of the universe.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.458
City of miracles

02:21.416 --> 02:23.500
in a land saved from the sea.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.750
But I no longer believe in miracles.

02:32.666 --> 02:36.583
And in a few days,
my life as I know it will be over.

02:58.583 --> 02:59.666
Bollocks.

04:48.916 --> 04:50.125
Reception center.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.000
Not playing house tonight, Lord Doyle?

05:00.125 --> 05:03.375
Not tonight, Kai.
No, I practically bled this place dry.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.291
If I win any more money from the Royale,
they'll be paying you in arrears.

05:07.791 --> 05:09.166
Order me a car, would you?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.166
My sincere apologies, Lord Doyle,

05:11.250 --> 05:13.958
but I'm told the hotel limousines
are all tied up tonight.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.041
All of them?

05:16.708 --> 05:18.250
Shall I call you a taxi?

05:18.750 --> 05:20.625
Never mind. It's a pleasant evening.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.000
I think I'll walk.

05:23.958 --> 05:24.958
Do you mind?

05:31.458 --> 05:35.541
All I need is one big win, Kai,
and they'll be throwing limousines at me.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.166
Try the Rainbow Casino, sir.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.166
You might get credit there.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.375
Lord Doyle!

05:50.958 --> 05:52.958
Oh. Mounts up, doesn't it?

05:53.666 --> 05:56.416
A prompt settlement
would be best for everyone, Lord Doyle.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.041
Of course. Of course.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.541
I shall call my banker in London

05:59.625 --> 06:01.791
and have him wire you
the outstanding amount immediately.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.416
-Lord Doyle!
-It is a Saturday.

06:03.916 --> 06:08.333
Banks are closed in the UK.
Sunday tomorrow, bank holiday Monday.

06:08.416 --> 06:11.208
My account manager will be back at work
first thing Tuesday morning.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.375
Tuesday afternoon, our time.
Will that suit?

06:14.458 --> 06:18.250
The full balance of HK$352,000.64

06:18.333 --> 06:22.333
must be paid by noon
on Tuesday, Lord Doyle,

06:22.416 --> 06:25.833
or I'll be forced to notify the police.

06:27.416 --> 06:28.625
Noon on Tuesday.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.000
You have three days.

07:07.916 --> 07:10.125
In Macau, I am a gwai lo,

07:12.625 --> 07:13.791
a foreign ghost…

07:15.583 --> 07:17.708
cloaked in invisibility.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.916
Here, I barely exist.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.958
Here, I can be whoever I want to be.

08:01.750 --> 08:05.083
Punto banco baccarat
is the fastest card game on the planet.

08:06.208 --> 08:09.083
Millions can be won or lost
in a single bet.

08:09.833 --> 08:12.666
And with a mere .9 advantage
to the casino,

08:13.166 --> 08:17.291
the prince of card games
can change your life in an instant.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.666
The rules are simple.

08:42.458 --> 08:46.041
Two cards are dealt face down
to the player with the highest wager.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.833
Highest hand wins.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.791
Cards two to nine score face value.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.958
Tens and picture cards score nothing.

08:59.666 --> 09:02.041
Highest score is nine.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.250
Nine wins!

09:06.000 --> 09:06.833
Player takes all.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.041
Welcome to the Rainbow. May I interest you
in a glass of champagne, sir?

09:17.125 --> 09:19.041
I don't want any cheap champagne.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.125
-Just give me Cristal.
-Okay.

09:22.666 --> 09:24.208
You speak good Chinese.

09:24.708 --> 09:27.916
I smoke Chinese cigarettes too.
The kind that kill.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.708
My name is Dao Ming.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.166
Really? Lord Doyle.

09:34.666 --> 09:36.750
An honor to meet you, Lord Doyle.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.416
Have you played baccarat before?

09:39.500 --> 09:42.500
Once or twice. Mostly in Monte Carlo.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.458
Who's the old biddy?

09:46.166 --> 09:47.916
-That's Grandma.
-Grandma?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.375
We don't speak her name. She's a killer.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.041
Her husband fools around
while she spends his money.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.541
-It's a good arrangement for us.
-Killer, is she?

09:55.625 --> 09:57.166
They say she sees spirits.

09:57.666 --> 10:00.250
Well, let's hope they don't tell her
what's on the cards.

10:19.541 --> 10:20.666
Nine wins.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.750
Death by guillotine. That's why I love it.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.958
Nothing like it in the universe.

10:27.041 --> 10:30.208
-The gwai lo is screwing up badly.
-He has the look of bad luck.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.916
My Cantonese is rusty. What did she say?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Grandma welcomes you.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.291
I can burst his balls with one hand.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.333
Surely a lord has deep pockets.

10:39.416 --> 10:40.875
Only millionaires play in gloves.

10:40.958 --> 10:44.791
You'll need billions to beat Grandma.
Billions of dollars and no sense.

10:45.291 --> 10:48.291
-Her luck will run out.
-Not if the spirit world is with her.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.375
Spirit world, my arse.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.833
The only thing on Grandma's side
is her husband's wallet. Twenty thousand.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.708
-Thirty.
-Thirty-five.

10:55.583 --> 10:56.750
Fifty.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.208
-Hey. Do you want credit?
-Credit?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.791
Twenty thousand US at 15% plus commission.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.083
Fifty thousand at ten.

11:53.166 --> 11:54.666
Twenty-five at 12.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.250
Done.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.791
What the fuck? You gonna lend him money?

11:59.291 --> 12:01.458
Just look at his dick face.
His luck has run out.

12:01.541 --> 12:04.458
-What did she say?
-She says you're a bad gambler.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.500
Well, then, all the more reason
to open me that line of credit.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.250
Fuck credit! You're a loan shark.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.083
-This transaction will fucking kill you!
-Let me worry about that.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.166
-Is there a problem?
-No.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.541
Your bar bill. Settle up first,
and we'll take care of your credit line.

12:20.625 --> 12:21.875
Of… course.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.541
He's gonna make an escape.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.541
Actually, why don't you order
another bottle of bubbly,

12:26.625 --> 12:30.041
and I'll come back from the men's room
and skin her alive?

12:32.041 --> 12:33.125
Wait here?

12:36.958 --> 12:37.958
Of course.

12:38.875 --> 12:39.875
Thank you.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.416
Don't fucking do it.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.708
The bastard won't come back.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.041
You stupid cunt.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.708
He's a lost soul.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.041
Oh fuck.

13:05.458 --> 13:08.125
Today marks the first day

13:08.208 --> 13:11.791
of the Festival of the Hungry Ghosts.

13:11.875 --> 13:16.583
Residents from all over the city
bring offerings to be burned for the dead,

13:16.666 --> 13:19.333
honoring and appeasing restless spirits.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.208
Thank you.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.958
Why did you lend him the money?

14:50.041 --> 14:51.791
-Dao Ming.
-I am sorry.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.625
-My husband died because of you!
-Hey! Hey, hey!

14:54.708 --> 14:56.041
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa!

14:58.875 --> 15:01.583
-I want my husband back!
-Dao Ming!

15:02.083 --> 15:04.541
-You killed my husband!
-Dao Ming!

15:11.708 --> 15:13.541
Taxi! Taxi!

15:21.541 --> 15:22.458
Dao Ming!

15:38.958 --> 15:40.125
Where are you going?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.875
You owe me 300 US for the champagne.

15:43.958 --> 15:45.583
I don't have it on me. Sorry.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.291
Thank you.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.541
Wait!

16:08.208 --> 16:09.791
I'd like to make it up to you.

16:10.833 --> 16:11.666
How about…

16:11.750 --> 16:13.583
How about dinner and a dance?

16:13.666 --> 16:15.833
You know, we could come
to some arrangement.

16:15.916 --> 16:17.500
I hate gamblers.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.250
I'm standing at a statistical crossroads.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.583
It's possible I keep on losing,

16:21.666 --> 16:24.208
but probability says
I have to start winning.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.958
Probability won't save you.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.666
Well, isn't that what life is?
The statistical improbability.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.625
Life is a mysterious gift.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.833
Look, I… I played my way into this mess.

16:34.916 --> 16:37.375
With the right backing,
I can play my way out.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.375
Look, look, look.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.458
I've had a run of bad luck.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.958
I've tried all the usual creditors, but…

16:48.125 --> 16:49.416
word gets around.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.750
I find myself in a bit of a bind.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.166
Thank you.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.958
Was he a client of yours?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.750
You know, the… fellow who jumped?

17:28.416 --> 17:29.750
It's not your fault.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.958
If a man wants to chuck himself
off a building, that's his prerogative.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.708
A permanent solution
to a temporary problem, I say.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.583
I thought you were very distinguished

17:59.666 --> 18:02.750
when I first saw you in the casino
with your yellow gloves.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.416
I've never seen anyone wear gloves
in a casino before.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.041
Savile Row's finest.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.750
They're my good luck gloves.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.041
But you have bad luck.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.916
I have a proposition.

18:20.916 --> 18:23.500
-I propose a mutually beneficial--
-I'm not interested.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.166
-Just hear me out, at least.
-No.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.958
-I'll give you half of--
-You hear me! No more credit.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.875
Not to you or anyone else. I've given up!

18:36.125 --> 18:37.083
On what?

18:37.791 --> 18:38.708
Life?

18:58.250 --> 19:00.791
Trust me, I've been close
to throwing in the towel myself.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.250
More than once.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.000
My guess is,

19:06.625 --> 19:08.791
he owed money, which means you owe money.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.000
It's none of my business,
but whatever predicament you're in,

19:14.083 --> 19:16.291
there are better ways out of it
than killing yourself.

19:16.791 --> 19:18.916
By lending money to another addict?

19:23.833 --> 19:25.500
Don't sound so high and mighty.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.166
If you're a broker at a high-end casino,
you make straight commission. You're not.

19:30.708 --> 19:34.041
You make your money from dodgy lines
of credit and illegal side bets.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.333
If you want me to leave, I'll leave.
You can top yourself.

19:37.416 --> 19:39.958
But please don't pretend
you're superior to me.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.833
I may be a gwai lo,
but I still have a soul.

19:44.791 --> 19:46.916
As far as I can see,
it's no more lost than yours.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.333
I should have refused him credit.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.500
I should have told him no, but I didn't.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.291
What was his name?

21:23.166 --> 21:24.750
I've known so many.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.083
You're all the same.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.041
I'm not.

21:28.833 --> 21:32.333
What makes you any different,
apart from being a lord?

21:33.791 --> 21:35.208
My lucky gloves.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.500
Savile Row's finest?

21:40.000 --> 21:40.875
Yes.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.958
It's the Festival of the Hungry Ghost.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.416
In a week, it will be Ghost Day.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.000
That's when people burn offerings
to the dead.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.500
I have to leave here.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.666
So should you.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.041
Where to?

22:29.250 --> 22:30.833
Don't try to follow me.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.875
I was hoping you might

22:45.000 --> 22:46.291
stick around a while.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.041
I'm about to win big.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.833
And when I do,
I won't just pay my debts off.

22:53.916 --> 22:55.166
I'll pay yours too.

22:58.583 --> 22:59.583
Seriously.

23:02.041 --> 23:02.958
Chin up.

23:03.541 --> 23:04.750
It never lasts.

23:06.583 --> 23:08.375
And when my ship comes in, I…

23:10.000 --> 23:10.958
I won't forget you.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.083
That's a promise.

23:13.583 --> 23:15.666
And a lord never goes back on his word.

23:30.958 --> 23:33.208
I have run out of chances.

23:47.708 --> 23:49.041
Keep doing that.

26:04.708 --> 26:06.416
Best foot forward now.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.666
A lord never goes back on his word.

27:16.000 --> 27:16.875
Oh.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.166
Hello.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.000
-Hi.
-Lord Doyle.

27:31.000 --> 27:31.958
I'm sorry?

27:32.041 --> 27:33.750
I… You can call me Freddy.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.333
Oh. Thanks.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.541
First time to Macau?

27:40.541 --> 27:42.666
-I'm sorry?
-I said is it your first trip to Macau?

27:42.750 --> 27:43.583
Yes.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.916
-You?
-No, I come and go.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.458
Oh. That sounds exciting.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.125
I don't mean to be forward,

27:52.208 --> 27:55.041
but I'd be grateful
if you could delete that photo.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.500
-What?
-The one you just took of me in the lift.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.666
Oh… The selfie?

28:00.750 --> 28:02.666
Yes, with me in it.

28:02.750 --> 28:06.333
-Oh, no… Oh, I had no idea you were--
-Well, I… I… I hate to ask.

28:06.416 --> 28:10.083
It's just my privacy means…
it means rather a lot to me.

28:10.583 --> 28:11.583
Why?

28:12.541 --> 28:13.375
Why?

28:13.916 --> 28:15.541
I mean, you're not on the run, are you?

28:16.791 --> 28:19.916
No. No, no, no. It's…
There's no great mystery to it.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.208
It's simply that every genuine high roller
values discretion.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.250
-Oh.
-Yes, discretion is our code.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.000
-Oh, it is, is it?
-It is, actually.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.750
Yeah. Yeah.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.833
Because, actually, you look…
I mean, if I were to say,

28:35.625 --> 28:38.958
like a bit of a show-off
for someone on the lam.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.625
-You didn't tell me your name.
-Betty.

28:44.708 --> 28:46.541
-Betty who?
-Grayson.

28:59.666 --> 29:01.208
Right, then, Betty Grayson.

29:01.291 --> 29:03.000
Who are you? What do you want?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.791
-You know exactly what I want.
-What, money?

29:04.875 --> 29:06.458
-Justice.
-Justice?

29:07.375 --> 29:08.250
All right.

29:09.458 --> 29:12.375
You lend me $500, you can have
all the fucking justice you want.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.208
Lord Doyle, you're such a card.

29:14.291 --> 29:16.375
You want my photo?
I'm just giving you terms.

29:16.458 --> 29:17.916
-Terms?
-Yeah, terms. Why not?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.958
You fucked up in the lift.
I caught you red-handed.

29:20.041 --> 29:22.916
You tried to give me the slip.
Right? Now you're sweating it out.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.666
You're biding your time,
playing the lonely English tourist

29:25.750 --> 29:27.083
on a package tour of China.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.000
Hoping I'll be stupid, let you have
another crack at me with your camera

29:30.083 --> 29:31.541
so you can email my photo back

29:31.625 --> 29:35.083
to whatever tawdry little
private investigator's firm sent you here

29:35.166 --> 29:37.166
to do whatever the fuck
you came here to do,

29:37.250 --> 29:38.875
which is probably to threaten me.

29:40.916 --> 29:43.541
But the thing is, they don't allow
photography in the casinos, right?

29:43.625 --> 29:46.250
So you won't get another photo,
not unless you damn well pay me.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.458
So come on, Betty,
get off your high horse. Fork it over.

29:49.541 --> 29:51.500
I want 500 US now.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.875
Down to your last penny, are you,

29:55.583 --> 29:56.916
Mr. Reilly?

30:03.041 --> 30:04.041
Hey!

30:06.166 --> 30:07.416
Excuse… Excuse me.

30:11.666 --> 30:13.083
-Fuck!
-Reilly!

31:27.083 --> 31:29.875
I've beaten better men than you
at this game.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.375
Give me my handbag.

31:38.291 --> 31:41.333
-Where the bloody hell's my phone?
-I want the 500 first.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.875
-Give me the phone.
-Money first, then photo.

31:53.583 --> 31:54.583
Thank you.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.250
What about my phone?

32:01.833 --> 32:03.416
We had an agreement.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.666
My photo's worth more than 500.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.291
Your only hope is to sit back, relax,

32:07.375 --> 32:09.625
and marvel
while I turn this into ten grand.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Watch and learn, Betty.

32:34.833 --> 32:36.333
This is to leave me alone.

32:36.416 --> 32:38.041
No, we made a deal.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.541
Look, I'm offering you the equivalent
of 10,000 US dollars. Just take it.

32:41.625 --> 32:42.750
I can't.

32:42.833 --> 32:44.166
Of course you can.

32:44.666 --> 32:46.250
You can't afford not to. This is…

32:46.750 --> 32:49.625
Ten thousand is the conservatory
you always wanted. A Caribbean holiday.

32:49.708 --> 32:51.666
New kitchen. Decent clothes.

32:53.166 --> 32:55.583
You never were gonna
give me back my phone, were you?

32:56.083 --> 32:57.375
Isn't this much better?

32:58.708 --> 33:01.375
Not everybody is like you.

33:06.833 --> 33:07.666
Wait!

33:07.750 --> 33:09.333
For fuck's sake.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.500
Wait. Look, look, I've made some mistakes
in the past, right?

33:13.583 --> 33:17.958
Who hasn't? But the point is, look,
I… I'm trying to make a new start. Right?

33:18.041 --> 33:21.250
Now, whatever you might think of me,
I'm not a criminal.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.333
You stole a considerable sum
of money from our client.

33:26.500 --> 33:30.125
And the fact that you quite evidently have
a gambling problem is not an excuse--

33:30.208 --> 33:32.375
I do not have a gambling problem.

33:32.875 --> 33:33.791
Okay? Now…

33:34.541 --> 33:37.000
Look, how about…
how about dinner and a dance?

33:37.083 --> 33:39.666
You know? I mean,
maybe we can come to some arrangement.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.416
I beg your pardon?

33:41.500 --> 33:43.666
I'm asking you to dance, Betty.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.291
How dare you!

33:45.375 --> 33:47.875
-Live a little!
-Oh, bugger off!

33:49.416 --> 33:51.666
Well, at least take the 500 I owe you.

33:52.250 --> 33:56.500
Keep it. You'll only blow it all
on the next round of baccarat.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.250
Bloody gamblers!

34:04.250 --> 34:05.083
Fuck.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.458
You're running out of puff.

34:15.958 --> 34:19.833
I may be out of puff,
but… I still have my balls.

34:21.041 --> 34:23.333
Yeah, right. Not for long.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.958
Grandma scores another nine.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.041
Not so lucky after all, huh?

34:50.958 --> 34:52.333
Well, I… I should…

34:54.250 --> 34:55.416
I should be getting home.

35:14.500 --> 35:15.500
Dao Ming!

35:20.250 --> 35:22.250
Where were you? Where were…

35:53.541 --> 35:54.916
Player scores four.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.875
Banker scores eight.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.250
Gwai lo loses all.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.125
Mr. Reilly?

36:11.750 --> 36:13.958
So, as you've clearly worked out,

36:14.041 --> 36:18.583
Strick and Garland are
a wealth management firm based in the UK.

36:19.083 --> 36:21.208
Not content to leave matters
in the hands of the police,

36:21.291 --> 36:23.583
they have hired my firm,
Huntsworth Investigations,

36:23.666 --> 36:29.208
to locate a Mr. Reilly in connection
with the theft of £957,000 sterling

36:29.291 --> 36:31.208
from a client account in the UK.

36:35.833 --> 36:37.750
-Cynthia?
-Blithe.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.166
Preferred "Betty."

36:39.250 --> 36:41.291
The trail went cold in Manila.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.375
Did it? That's…

36:43.833 --> 36:45.166
That's exciting.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.583
No more games, Mr. Reilly.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.625
This just came in.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.416
-What's that?
-You know perfectly well what it is.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.833
It is the copy
of a recently released death certificate.

36:55.916 --> 36:59.791
You know that 'cause it's yours,
or purports to be.

36:59.875 --> 37:04.708
It was procured from a Filipino official
in Manila a few weeks ago for cash.

37:04.791 --> 37:08.708
I see. So I look like this… dead fella,

37:09.208 --> 37:10.291
Mr…?

37:10.791 --> 37:12.583
-Reilly.
-Reilly.

37:18.041 --> 37:21.625
I've been authorized
to propose to you a deal.

37:23.458 --> 37:27.083
Either the stolen money is deposited back
in Strick and Garland's account

37:27.166 --> 37:28.750
within 24 hours

37:28.833 --> 37:32.375
or I will have you deported to the UK
to face charges.

37:33.375 --> 37:34.375
Deported?

37:34.875 --> 37:36.333
I have my photograph.

37:36.875 --> 37:39.208
After the background checks are complete,

37:39.291 --> 37:41.916
London will forward your file
to the police.

37:42.416 --> 37:43.916
Unless you cooperate.

37:46.375 --> 37:48.833
You have 24 hours, Mr. Reilly.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.500
Do you like your job?

37:57.375 --> 37:59.833
All that hard work
and nothing to show for it

37:59.916 --> 38:02.458
but cheap shoes
and a miserable state pension.

38:03.541 --> 38:05.166
It's not much of a life, is it?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.666
You stole that money
from a helpless old woman.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.416
No, a stinking rich old woman,
and selfish and self-centered--

38:12.500 --> 38:15.666
Who trusted you to manage her portfolio.

38:16.916 --> 38:19.541
If… if you will forgive me
for saying so, Mr. Reilly,

38:19.625 --> 38:23.166
what I see is a criminal
through and through.

38:23.875 --> 38:29.958
And worse, a man whose childish pride
has set him way beyond any redemption.

38:30.666 --> 38:31.958
Really? Is that what you see?

38:32.041 --> 38:34.375
Your Lord Doyle routine?

38:34.875 --> 38:36.666
It's pathetic.

38:37.166 --> 38:40.000
It's shabby, and it's amateurish.

38:40.750 --> 38:44.625
"Doyle"? It's not even a posh name.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.416
You couldn't even get that right.

38:50.833 --> 38:53.750
You have till tomorrow, midday.

39:34.541 --> 39:35.583
Dao Ming!

39:40.583 --> 39:41.791
Dao Ming!

39:44.458 --> 39:45.833
I need your help.

40:35.791 --> 40:36.791
Lippett!

40:38.208 --> 40:39.208
Lippett!

40:44.708 --> 40:46.583
Hey, sir! Hey, sir!

40:46.666 --> 40:48.916
-Let me through! Lippett!
-Sir!

40:49.000 --> 40:51.333
Let me through! Lippett! Don't touch me!

40:51.416 --> 40:52.666
-Hey, sir!
-Let me through!

40:53.833 --> 40:55.625
Have a drink, man. You're causing a scene.

40:55.708 --> 40:57.291
I have to get out of Macau.

40:58.291 --> 41:01.125
There's a boat to Hong Kong
in three hours.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.500
Always time for a sharpener.

41:02.583 --> 41:05.583
You owe me eight grand.
I haven't got time to argue. Just pay up.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.125
-What's happened?
-Now!

41:07.208 --> 41:08.791
All right, all right.

41:09.291 --> 41:10.166
Here.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.875
-There's only two grand here.
-Well, it's all I've got.

41:29.958 --> 41:32.625
-Well, how'd you pay for the girls?
-They're on credit.

41:32.708 --> 41:35.416
For God's sake. Now, calm down,
and I'll stand you a drink.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.833
I need all of it.

41:36.916 --> 41:40.750
Oh, come on. How about dinner and a dance?
We could come to some arrangement.

41:40.833 --> 41:43.458
That's my line, you bastard!
Don't fucking play me, Adrian!

41:43.541 --> 41:46.583
God, man, relax.
I mean, you look dreadful.

41:46.666 --> 41:50.708
You'll feel better after a good meal
and a few glasses of decent Douro.

41:50.791 --> 41:52.083
I'll pay.

41:53.000 --> 41:53.833
Come on.

41:54.458 --> 41:55.500
Last hurrah.

41:56.000 --> 41:56.916
On me.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.000
What's wrong with you?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.916
You're not ill, are you?

42:04.250 --> 42:06.458
You were never tough enough
for this game, Reilly.

42:07.583 --> 42:10.833
You underestimated the savagery
of the English upper classes.

42:11.333 --> 42:15.791
Generations of murder and intrigue
lie behind our stately homes.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.916
And a really expensive public school

42:19.541 --> 42:23.833
firms up the genes
by training us to be absolute bastards.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.583
What did you just say?

42:27.083 --> 42:28.125
I'm sorry?

42:28.875 --> 42:31.000
Reilly. You… you just called me Reilly.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.625
How did you know my name?

42:42.666 --> 42:43.875
It was you.

42:43.958 --> 42:46.750
You told Huntsworth Investigations
where to find me, didn't you?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.791
You fucking snitched on me.

42:51.291 --> 42:53.666
Yeah, I had to throw her a bone,
I'm afraid.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.250
Pay you?

42:55.750 --> 42:57.125
Did she offer you money?

42:58.833 --> 42:59.708
Amnesty.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.791
Got my own tracks to cover, old chap.

43:04.291 --> 43:07.791
Be grateful
that I'm not blackmailing you myself.

43:09.541 --> 43:11.916
There's a phrase in Chinese.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.250
"Dead to shame."

43:17.833 --> 43:19.541
I'm dead to shame, Reilly.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.416
You should try it.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.208
You know, I'm just not sure
it's really you.

43:26.125 --> 43:29.666
Deep down, you're just
a nice, working-class Irish boy

43:30.166 --> 43:32.416
in way over his head.

43:38.583 --> 43:39.833
What will you do?

43:42.833 --> 43:43.958
I don't know.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.708
Well, for God's sake,
don't do anything rash.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.916
We've all thought about it.

43:49.416 --> 43:50.541
Suicide.

43:51.666 --> 43:53.291
Even me, believe it or not.

43:56.041 --> 43:59.583
You've heard the one about the gambler
who wakes up in the afterlife,

44:00.208 --> 44:03.666
comes to in a sumptuous casino,

44:04.166 --> 44:06.416
champagne on ice, girls everywhere,

44:06.500 --> 44:09.041
wins every single hand,
one after the other after the other.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.375
He can't lose.

44:10.916 --> 44:13.541
Eventually, he turns to the player
next to him and says,

44:13.625 --> 44:15.875
"I didn't think
I was gonna make it to heaven."

44:15.958 --> 44:17.916
"I thought I was destined
for the other place."

44:18.416 --> 44:20.166
The player next to him
looks at him and says--

44:20.250 --> 44:21.625
"This is the other place."

44:24.083 --> 44:25.250
Oh, cheer up.

44:25.750 --> 44:28.916
Winning'll kill you
a damn sight quicker than losing.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.625
Oh, you've cleared me out, old chap.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.750
Dinner's on you, I'm afraid.

45:02.458 --> 45:06.416
Next station Hong Kong Harbor. Final stop.

45:07.458 --> 45:09.750
All passengers disembark.

46:06.666 --> 46:08.666
Excuse me.
Could I have another buck's fizz, please?

46:08.750 --> 46:09.666
Of course.

46:13.333 --> 46:14.208
Cheers.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.500
Would you like the bill, sir?

46:31.458 --> 46:33.291
Caviar and blinis, please.

46:33.833 --> 46:35.000
Of course, sir.

46:53.875 --> 46:54.708
Fuck.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.875
Sorry, what time is it?

47:25.958 --> 47:27.041
It's noon, sir.

47:28.166 --> 47:29.875
Would you like to settle up, sir?

47:31.208 --> 47:32.041
No.

47:32.541 --> 47:34.666
Not yet. I'd like a…

47:35.541 --> 47:39.166
a vodka martini
with a twist and a dash of Angostura.

47:39.250 --> 47:40.666
Just one dash.

47:41.166 --> 47:44.958
Well, sir, you would need to settle up
before ordering another drink.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.416
Would I?

47:47.041 --> 47:47.958
Yes, sir.

47:49.958 --> 47:53.833
How about you bring me the vodka,
and I'll settle up then?

47:54.750 --> 47:57.041
-I don't think we can do that, sir.
-Why not?

47:57.833 --> 47:59.416
I'm very sorry, sir.

48:02.000 --> 48:02.875
I see.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.125
Are you okay, sir?

48:12.208 --> 48:13.416
You take cards?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Yes.

48:57.625 --> 48:58.583
Hi.

49:03.166 --> 49:04.000
Oh.

49:05.041 --> 49:06.375
Tell me it's you.

49:06.958 --> 49:08.041
I thought…

49:09.333 --> 49:11.625
I thought I'd never see you again.

49:16.083 --> 49:17.791
Is this what a lord would do?

49:18.291 --> 49:19.125
Well,

49:19.916 --> 49:23.041
perhaps if he was a lord
who forgot his wallet.

49:23.541 --> 49:26.708
Or doesn't like to pay
for such trivial things as bar bills.

49:27.208 --> 49:30.708
-I must have left my money in Macau.
-That's silly of you.

49:30.791 --> 49:33.166
-Well, I… I do that sometimes.
-Do you?

49:33.250 --> 49:35.125
Yes, I'm forgetful.

49:36.041 --> 49:37.291
It's a trait of mine.

49:37.791 --> 49:38.791
I see.

49:41.625 --> 49:42.958
What are you doing here?

49:43.500 --> 49:44.666
What are the chances?

49:44.750 --> 49:46.125
It's not chance.

49:54.000 --> 49:54.875
You're burning up.

49:58.708 --> 50:01.375
What would you say if I…

50:03.041 --> 50:04.625
if I told you I was…

50:06.208 --> 50:09.416
I was actually having a… heart attack?

51:32.541 --> 51:33.458
Hi.

51:34.083 --> 51:34.916
Hey.

51:59.583 --> 52:00.916
How did I get here?

52:01.708 --> 52:05.250
I brought you here from urgent care.
You slept for two days.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.041
Christ.

52:08.958 --> 52:10.041
What day is it?

52:10.125 --> 52:11.125
Thursday.

52:12.541 --> 52:14.958
-Fuck. I have to go.
-Go where?

52:15.458 --> 52:17.541
Back to Macau. I… I'm two days late.

52:17.625 --> 52:20.958
If I don't pay up, they'll…
they'll arrest me.

52:21.458 --> 52:23.291
If you go back now, you will die.

52:23.958 --> 52:25.250
What do you mean, die?

52:25.750 --> 52:28.083
Gambling almost killed you.
I told you it would.

52:28.166 --> 52:29.250
But you didn't listen.

52:30.625 --> 52:32.291
Well, I'm not dead yet, am I?

52:32.375 --> 52:34.166
If you carry on, you will be.

52:36.833 --> 52:38.541
Any chance of a dry martini?

52:54.250 --> 52:55.375
It's hereditary.

52:55.875 --> 52:56.833
What is?

52:57.416 --> 53:01.166
The little gambling habit you mentioned.

53:01.250 --> 53:02.458
That and the drinking.

53:02.541 --> 53:06.291
I… I inherited them
from a long line of men in my family.

53:07.500 --> 53:10.625
Did you inherit your yellow gloves
from your ancestors too?

53:11.416 --> 53:14.416
I noticed they were made in China,
not Savile Row.

53:20.291 --> 53:21.125
Ah.

53:37.166 --> 53:38.500
What is this?

53:39.125 --> 53:40.125
Is it your number?

53:41.083 --> 53:42.250
It's a test.

53:42.916 --> 53:43.958
What kind of test?

53:44.458 --> 53:45.416
You'll see.

53:47.666 --> 53:49.500
Come on! Jump in!

54:42.541 --> 54:44.166
Let's play a game.

54:47.291 --> 54:49.500
We get one question each.

54:52.083 --> 54:53.791
And we have to tell the truth.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.083
The truth?

55:02.958 --> 55:04.833
What are you running away from?

55:13.041 --> 55:15.708
I stole a lot of money
from a rich old lady.

55:21.375 --> 55:23.333
It's the truth I'm running away from.

55:25.125 --> 55:28.208
I'm not just an addict.
I'm a liar and a thief.

55:30.791 --> 55:31.791
A fraud.

55:40.666 --> 55:42.500
I've never admitted that before.

55:48.166 --> 55:50.333
I want so bad, just for once…

55:52.541 --> 55:54.208
just for once…

55:56.000 --> 55:57.458
to be free of shame.

56:06.375 --> 56:07.375
Okay.

56:09.375 --> 56:10.333
My turn.

56:15.166 --> 56:16.541
Why are you trying to help me?

56:18.750 --> 56:21.750
Because… you and I

56:22.708 --> 56:24.000
are the same.

56:28.708 --> 56:31.041
In the village where I grew up…

56:33.166 --> 56:36.041
girls were considered

56:36.541 --> 56:37.708
bad luck.

56:40.541 --> 56:43.125
So, as soon as I was old enough,

56:44.208 --> 56:46.625
I stole money from my parents,

56:47.875 --> 56:51.166
so I could run away
and live a better life.

56:54.625 --> 56:58.583
And a week later,
my father died of a broken heart.

57:02.083 --> 57:04.458
I worked and worked,

57:05.166 --> 57:06.416
and every day,

57:07.208 --> 57:09.000
I put aside some money.

57:11.458 --> 57:15.375
I thought if I saved enough money

57:15.458 --> 57:17.958
to change my mother's life forever,

57:19.583 --> 57:21.125
she'd forgive me.

57:24.791 --> 57:26.541
But she just sent them back.

57:30.208 --> 57:32.375
Have you heard of the Buddhist hell?

57:33.291 --> 57:34.541
Naraka.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.666
The Realm of the Hungry Ghosts

57:38.916 --> 57:41.250
is for people driven by greed.

57:43.041 --> 57:46.500
They have huge mouths and thin necks.

57:48.208 --> 57:51.541
And no matter how much they eat or drink,

57:52.208 --> 57:54.416
they can never be satisfied.

57:56.625 --> 57:58.583
Do you think that's where we're headed?

58:01.708 --> 58:03.583
It's not too late for you.

58:14.208 --> 58:17.166
It'd take a miracle
to change a man like me.

59:35.916 --> 59:37.041
Dao Ming?

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:20.958
Hey.

01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:22.583
Nine wins.

01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:56.166
Come on.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.750
Oh!

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.791
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:26.416
Yeah!

01:06:57.625 --> 01:06:58.916
-Thank you.
-Bye.

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:21.916
Lord Doyle.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.375
-Yes.
-You missed the deadline, Lord Doyle.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.958
-I do apologize.
-By four days.

01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:29.000
I was detained by a friend.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:30.833
I regret to inform you that…

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.083
It's all there. HK$353,000.
You can keep the change.

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:41.000
Go on, count it.

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.375
Send up a bottle of champagne as well.

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:47.458
I must apologize
if there's been any misunder--

01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:50.083
In that case,
make it a Dom Pérignon. 1990.

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:04.500
Fucking hate champagne.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.375
It's not too late for you.

01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:16.166
Are you aware
of the statistical improbability

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.291
of seven nines in a row?

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:20.958
I mean, the odds of tossing a head
after five straight heads

01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:23.375
is still 50-50, Alfred.

01:09:23.458 --> 01:09:26.083
Seven nines is absolutely unheard of.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:28.125
I can't help it if I'm lucky.

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:30.125
It's not luck.

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:32.000
And I regret to say

01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:34.833
we have the evidence
to prove it, Lord Doyle.

01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:38.166
You accusing me of cheating?

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:41.625
One of my team
was watching your surveillance videos,

01:09:41.708 --> 01:09:45.083
and he swore
he saw a figure standing behind you.

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:47.291
A figure?

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:51.000
He swore he saw it.
And many of his colleagues believe him.

01:09:51.083 --> 01:09:53.125
So what on earth are you talking about?

01:09:55.916 --> 01:10:00.000
Head office say
that you have a ghost attached to you.

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:06.458
A wh…?

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.333
-What?
-It has been known to happen.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:17.375
I'm asking you
not to play again at the casino.

01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:28.333
Well, I'd like to see that video.

01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:30.208
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.125
You're telling me a ghost story, Alfred.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:35.666
My associates are superstitious,
and so are my staff.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:38.875
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:43.208
My organization's position is clear.

01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:45.458
You are no longer welcome here.

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:55.208
Then I shall take my custom elsewhere.

01:10:55.291 --> 01:10:57.083
Or anywhere else in Macau.

01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:58.625
I beg your pardon?

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:02.875
Every casino in Macau has been issued
with your name and photograph

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:05.500
and instructed to alert the police.

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:08.916
Cross the line, you'll be arrested.

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.458
We both know what this is.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.916
You can't handle a winner.

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.791
Feeling lucky, gwai lo?

01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:49.833
Are you finally dead to shame, Reilly?

01:13:18.333 --> 01:13:20.250
It's not too late for you.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.375
Alfred,

01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:26.458
I… I need one more hand.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:31.041
Look, I'm offering you over HK$8 million
on a single hand of baccarat.

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:33.500
Don't seriously tell me
you're gonna turn that down.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:36.250
If I lose, it proves there's no ghost.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:38.916
If I win, I… I leave Macau forever.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.041
Either way, you're better off.

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:43.750
You have to let me play!

01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:46.416
All of it.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.000
Reilly!

01:14:36.583 --> 01:14:37.500
Reilly!

01:14:38.416 --> 01:14:40.916
What the bloody hell are you playing at?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.583
You were supposed to transfer
that stolen money four days ago.

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:45.625
-Look, Cynthia--
-Don't "Cynthia" me.

01:14:45.708 --> 01:14:48.041
Your winning streak's
all over bloody social media.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:51.083
I've cut you all the slack I can.
I'm calling the police!

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:04.708
I only have three-quarters
of what I owe you.

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:07.041
And the old woman's not
the only one I stole from.

01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:11.291
Now, if you call the cops now,
you… you won't get what you need.

01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:13.291
Okay, just…

01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:16.041
Just give me one more hand.

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:20.125
Then I can… I can pay you.
And everyone else.

01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:21.500
All right?

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:26.541
I've sworn to pay back all of my debts,
and a lord never goes back on his word.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:28.958
Cut the "lord" crap.
Just give me all you've got right now.

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.916
Oh, Cynthia. Cynthia, listen to me.

01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:34.000
We both grew up on gray and rainy islands.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
In homes where there wasn't enough
to go around.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.041
And we've…

01:15:38.541 --> 01:15:40.750
And we ate our fill
of lumpy mashed potatoes,

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:44.375
and we both lived out
our share of dull, suburban days.

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:48.375
We made wildly different choices
in life, yes,

01:15:49.666 --> 01:15:52.333
but our different choices have led us both
to this exact moment.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:56.916
What are you talking about?

01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:58.708
We have the power to…

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:02.208
We have the power
to change each other's destinies.

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:04.625
You're not drunk, are you?

01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:06.916
I'm about to win more money
on a single hand of baccarat

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.500
than any human being on the planet
has ever won before.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.791
Now, what you choose to do
with that money, you know,

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:15.083
Strick and Garland's share,
that's up to you.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:18.666
But if I was you,
I'd proceed immediately to Manila

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.541
and fake your own death
for the price of a cheap hotel room.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:24.625
And I'd fulfil
your wildest fucking dreams.

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:33.958
You're a bad man, Mr. Reilly.

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:41.125
-I'll see you in the ballroom.
-I beg your pardon?

01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:45.500
I'm asking you to dance,

01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:47.791
Betty.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:01.875
Your Cristal, sir.

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:03.791
-Thank you.
-Cigar, Lord Doyle?

01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:14.833
Lord Doyle, there's a gentleman
who wishes to play against you.

01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:17.291
His name is Prince Lorenzo di Firenze.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:20.458
He's flown from Monte Carlo.
Will you accept it?

01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:33.916
Lord Doyle.

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:39.750
Your Highness.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:45.041
They say you are lucky.

01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.458
Everyone's lucky once.

01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:49.875
Well, this man has wisdom.

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:58.125
Are you lucky enough
to stake everything on a single hand?

01:18:02.666 --> 01:18:04.166
I expect nothing less.

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:09.458
Then I match your bet.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:05.500
Two and a nine.

01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:06.625
Modulo ten.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.333
Any score over ten drops ten.

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:09.833
Doyle scores one,

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:12.625
earning him the right to another card.

01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:52.250
Prince Lorenzo di Firenze scores seven.

01:20:58.208 --> 01:21:00.541
Eight. Total score of nine.

01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:02.500
Lord Doyle wins.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.125
May I ask
what you intend to do with the money?

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.625
I'm going to pay back my debts.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.166
Do you believe in miracles?

01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:10.125
I do now.

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.916
£957,000 sterling in Hong Kong dollars,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.958
at 10:00 a.m. this morning's
exchange rate.

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:20.041
What's the catch?

01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:23.041
There isn't one.

01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:27.750
Do not screw me, Reilly.

01:23:28.625 --> 01:23:29.916
Do you understand me?

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:36.083
Whatever bullshit you're planning,
whatever scam, whatever sales patter,

01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:38.000
do not screw me.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:46.333
There's an extra 50 grand on top for you.
It's not a payoff.

01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:48.541
It's a present.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.166
Live a little.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:07.416
Reilly?

01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:09.625
Yeah?

01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:15.125
How about that dance?

01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:30.250
You did it, Lord Doyle.

01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:33.083
Thanks, Kai.
I told you all I needed was one big win.

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:36.750
I always knew you had it in you, sir.
Your limousine awaits.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.250
Thank you.

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:48.916
Where to, Lord Doyle?

01:24:49.666 --> 01:24:51.000
The Rainbow, please.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.291
I fucking hate cigars.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.125
I've been waiting for you, milord.

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:38.708
I knew you couldn't resist. One final bet.

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:43.083
-I didn't come here to play.
-Nonsense. This is a casino.

01:25:43.583 --> 01:25:46.000
Hey, how about a side bet?

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.708
Three Card Six.

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:52.166
You're not serious.

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.416
Deadly.

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:56.041
No, but Three Card Six
has odds of 100 to one.

01:25:56.125 --> 01:25:59.375
I mean, if… if I win, you… you have to…

01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:01.875
Well, you'd owe me…

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.250
I have very deep pockets.

01:26:05.333 --> 01:26:09.250
Walk in with five cases,
walk out with 500.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.083
Have a seat.

01:26:21.416 --> 01:26:25.958
Give him a cold champagne
and a proper cigar.

01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:51.791
I'm done gambling.

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:53.708
Rubbish.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.083
Forever.

01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:58.458
If you're not here to gamble,
what are you doing here?

01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:03.250
I'm here to see Dao Ming.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:04.166
Dao Ming?

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:07.416
-She doesn't work here anymore.
-Do you know where I can find her?

01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:09.250
You can't.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:10.791
She's dead.

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:14.166
She's what?

01:27:15.541 --> 01:27:16.875
She drowned herself.

01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:21.333
She drowned herself?

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:26.166
The first night
of the Hungry Ghost. By the temple.

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:28.833
No, she can't have.

01:27:30.041 --> 01:27:33.416
That's impossible. We… we were together.
I sat up with her till morning.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.458
I'm sorry. It's true.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:45.375
They sent all her stuff back to China.

01:27:46.416 --> 01:27:49.500
There wasn't even enough
to pay for her cremation.

01:27:57.875 --> 01:27:58.708
Hey.

01:27:59.291 --> 01:28:00.666
I saw her. I was…

01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:04.625
I was with her. You know, I was…

01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:06.291
I was with her.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.416
How about the side bet?

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:12.541
Everything on one hand?

01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:21.500
No.

01:28:22.916 --> 01:28:23.791
No.

01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:26.458
No, this money, it's… it's for her.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:34.250
Dao Ming!

01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:43.791
Dao Ming!

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:47.333
Dao Ming!

01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:50.625
Dao Ming!

01:28:56.583 --> 01:28:57.750
Dao Ming!

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:00.375
Dao Ming!
