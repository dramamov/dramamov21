00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.520
I once saw that pattern

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.640
in the letter of my former mother-in-law

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.710
at the Marquis's Mansion.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.640
I suppose he used this pattern

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.070
to give her orders

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.390
and secretly smuggle Hongzhen Incense.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.870
You already know who it is, don't you?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.000
Before, I only suspected.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.280
But I can be certain tonight.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.560
This person is the uncle of His Majesty,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.640
the father of the Princess,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.230
Feng Zhengxin.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.550
No wonder.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.480
It's hard for ordinary people
to stir up such a great storm.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.350
Feng Zhengxin

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.230
appears to be compassionate

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.230
but is actually sinister and cunning,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.200
unfathomable.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.950
Starting from today,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.400
you should stay at home

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
and do not wander around.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.510
Leave your father's matter to me.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.270
Commander,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.040
can I go see my father?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.470
I promised you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.290
I would take good care of your father.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.080
Father.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.310
Wanning.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.080
Wanning.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.060
(Xu Residence)

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.030
Your Highness, it's late at night.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.110
Why don't we go back

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.520
and look for Xu Wanning another day?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
No.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.440
I've been searching for Heng
for several days,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.660
but I haven't seen him at all.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.870
I suspect

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.560
that he is together with Xu Wanning.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.800
Your Highness,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.220
sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.030
Wanning, no need for formalities.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.030
I have come this time specifically

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120
to apologize to you for the matter

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.750
at the birthday banquet.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.800
No, no, no.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.240
The one who should apologize is me.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.470
I ruined your birthday banquet.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.550
Your Highness,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.230
the matter of the birthday banquet

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.630
is already in the past.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.030
Heng,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.280
I have no other intentions
in coming here this time.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.560
I came especially to apologize
to Wanning.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.360
But Heng,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.480
why are you still with Wanning

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.560
so late?

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.430
It's like this.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.260
During the day
when I was handling matters,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.960
I just happened to run
into Commander Pei.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.580
Commander Pei saw it was late at night,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.160
so he conveniently escorted me back.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.000
It was just a coincidence.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.430
Was it an encounter?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.150
Yes.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.870
Since you no longer blame me,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.680
I'd like to stay over
at your place tonight.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
Is that OK?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
Sure.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.520
Your Highness, please come with me.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.000
Heng,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.360
be extra careful on your way back.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.870
Thank you for your concern.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.520
Let's go.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.580
(Xu Residence)

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.640
Go!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.360
Your Highness, my home is humble.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.320
I'm afraid you'll have to put up
with it tonight.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600
It's getting late.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.480
Then you should rest early.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.440
Wait a moment.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.160
There's nothing else.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.430
It has been six years since we parted

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.630
in the Capital City back then.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.390
We've had no more late-night talks.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.600
Now that we finally have some free time,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.630
I want to have a good chat with you.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.510
Your Highness, you are willing,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.860
I would naturally be delighted.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.270
Wanning,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.680
do you know why I have been alone

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.360
all these years?

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.680
I have been waiting for someone.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.190
I'm afraid that after all my waiting,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.870
it will end up being in vain.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
I like Pei Heng.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.430
I like him very much.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.910
Oh.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.120
Then why don't you just
confess your feelings to him?

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.240
Heng and I

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.830
grew up together since childhood.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.240
Since I was young, I swore

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.900
that when I grew up, I would marry him.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.040
When he was 18,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.330
he was already a grand general
with great influence

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.020
and countless military achievements.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.510
He could have had a bright future.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.870
If it weren't for me,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.150
he wouldn't have been plotted against
by the villains

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.390
and ended up disabled by accident.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.800
So to speak,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.870
Commander Pei was injured
because of you?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.600
Back then,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.600
I was young and ignorant,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.630
and forced my father to go to the camp
to look for him.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.000
But a battle was about to break out.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.310
In order to protect me,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.510
Heng...

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.080
Therefore,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.240
all these years,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.070
I have tried every possible way

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.950
to marry him to make up for my mistakes.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.190
But Heng

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.190
only wants to be alone.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.040
He doesn't want to implicate me.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.240
Perhaps he is doing it for your sake.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.510
Wanning,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.870
you know Heng very well.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.430
Not really.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.240
He's in charge of my father's case.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.070
When I was in Yan City,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.190
Commander Pei also helped me.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.920
We are both focused on business

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.040
and have little interaction in private.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.430
If that's the case,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.000
could you do me a favor?

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.670
Go ahead.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.830
You help me test Heng,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.800
and I help you rescue your father.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.280
Sorry,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.550
I can't help you.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.200
You still say we're friends,

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.370
yet you won't even help me with this.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.710
Could it be

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.000
that you have also fallen for Heng?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.840
My Lady, the young master seems
to have a fever.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.440
Your Highness,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.630
my child has a fever.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.720
I must hurry over.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.440
You should rest early.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.230
Come here.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.110
Do you know

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.060
why I called you here?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.920
I

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.280
don't know.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.600
Who did you meet tonight?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.680
I met...

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.740
I met...

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.710
Commander Pei.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.710
What did you say?

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.150
I didn't say anything.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.320
I didn't say anything.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.050
You're lying.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.490
I really did not...

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.030
Amitabha.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.870
So terrible!

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.470
Who on earth is the killer?

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.820
He was hanged at the gate.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.760
Hongmei,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.660
put the person down
and see if he can be saved.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.180
Stop! Move aside, move aside!

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.300
Go, go, go!

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.180
What are you doing?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.490
Destroy the body and cover it up?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.580
Someone, come here!

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.520
Take all the Xu Family members
to the government.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.320
Seal off this place.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.650
Wait!

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.340
May I ask what crime our family
has committed

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.700
that you want to take us all away?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.340
The Prefect's body is hanging right
at your doorstep.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.020
None of you can escape responsibility.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.220
Someone!

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.780
Immediately take the people here

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.330
all to the government for interrogation.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.300
- Take action.
- Wait.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.140
Who dares?

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.330
Heng, you finally came.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.770
They want to capture Wanning.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.010
Luckily, I was here.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.860
Otherwise, they would have taken action.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.540
Are you alright?

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.180
Commander Pei, Princess Anle,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.130
I am merely acting impartially.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.380
Then can you arrest people recklessly?

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.880
Doesn't that mean
I could just fight you directly?

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.660
Constable Yan,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.480
may I ask on what basis you determined

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.860
that our family is under suspicion?

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.380
This is obvious.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.580
The body is hanging right
at your doorstep.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.700
Everyone in this residence last night

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.980
is implicated.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.010
Since that is the case,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.380
Princess Anle also stayed
at my home yesterday.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.140
Are you going to take her away too?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.380
What she said is correct.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.300
Well...

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.380
Your Highness,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.720
this is all a misunderstanding.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.060
Last night you were here.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.060
How would they

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.150
dare to kill someone
right under your nose

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.020
and even hang the body
at the gate afterwards?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.250
I think someone must be framing them.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.010
If that's the case,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.060
then neither of us is a suspect, right?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.300
Yes.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.040
Someone! Quickly take the body down

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.400
and take it back to the government.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.470
The rest of you, follow me
to investigate carefully.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.390
Yes.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.780
Your Highness,

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.020
many thanks for today.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.700
Such a small matter
is not worth mentioning.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.340
If there's nothing else,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.860
then I'll head back first.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.220
Heng,

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.120
why not send me back?

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.140
(I have no time to think
about romance now.)

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.440
(The Prefect has been killed.)

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.440
(This means the Prince
has already taken action.)

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.630
(I must hurry.)

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.260
Didn't you escort the Princess back?

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.990
A murder occurred in the Xu Family.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.940
As the Commander of the Jinlin Guards,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.180
I must investigate thoroughly here.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.980
What else is there to investigate?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.700
You and I both know clearly

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.740
that the mastermind is the Prince.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.940
Handling a case requires evidence.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.260
Precisely because it is him,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.710
we need to be fully prepared

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.130
and find the key evidence

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.020
to strike a fatal blow.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.590
Your identity makes it inconvenient.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.580
I will find a way to get close to him.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.900
You're walking into the lion's den.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.120
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.580
As long as I can find evidence
to save my father,

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.900
I am willing to do anything.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.340
But you don't need
to sacrifice yourself.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.820
I can negotiate on your behalf.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.540
He is targeting our family.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.140
I must personally strike back.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.030
Moreover, if you can sacrifice yourself,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.380
why can't I?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.780
Father.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.660
Father, why are you doing this?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.780
I still want to ask
why you are opposing me.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.420
Father,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.860
I have never opposed you.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.420
Did you go to the Xu Family yesterday?

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.900
You are a princess.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.600
How improper it is

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.990
to show your face in public all day!

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.980
Starting from today,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.660
you will be confined in the Mansion.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.220
Your Highness,

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.060
the Princess has been spoiled
since childhood.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.500
I'm afraid she will...

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.420
It's because I spoiled her too much

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.460
that she ended up ruining my plan.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.580
I went to great lengths
to kill the Prefect

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.740
and hang him at the gate
of the Xu Family.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.940
If it weren't for her

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.180
proving Xu Wanning's innocence,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.580
I would have dealt with Xu Wanning
long ago.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.790
Things have come to this point.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.160
Your Highness, calm your anger.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.540
If it really doesn't work,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.100
I will go and get rid of her right away.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.740
This matter still requires
careful planning.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.100
I'm afraid word has already gotten out

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.380
about us smuggling Hongzhen Incense.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.620
We should act low-key.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.780
Yes.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.420
Your Highness,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.490
Xu Wanning requests an audience
with the Princess.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.980
Wonderful!

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.710
I, Xu Wanning, pay respects to you.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.300
I just heard the sound of the zither,

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.400
resonant and powerful.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.660
Just a few short notes,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.500
it carries a sense of killing intent.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.260
But when I came over,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.380
I saw a graceful and elegant lady,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.290
which greatly surprised me.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.480
Your Highness, you flatter me.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.500
I have taken the liberty to visit today

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.800
because the Princess stayed
at my house last night

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.860
and left behind a sachet.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.020
I came specially today to return it.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.300
Oh.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.340
(Yanlan Pavilion)

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.980
Well, Xu Wanning,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.620
I really underestimated you.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.780
You actually dare to seduce my father.
