of nude blob he's packing
under those jeans. [sighs]

20:34.001 --> 20:36.804
-Anyway, what preceded this?
-Oh, nothing.

20:36.839 --> 20:40.643
A really fun game
of volleyball.

20:40.678 --> 20:43.514
-That's it?
-Thoughts of death.

20:43.549 --> 20:44.515
What is it?

20:46.354 --> 20:49.080
[stammers]
Maybe some thoughts
of death?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.917
Thoughts of death!

20:50.952 --> 20:53.018
-Is that a problem?
-Oh.

20:53.053 --> 20:54.822
-What?
-I've heard of this.

20:54.857 --> 20:57.726
Of course, I didn't think
it was possible, but it's real.

20:59.631 --> 21:02.027
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.095
I didn't open a portal.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.769
[chuckles] Someone did.
And now, there is a rip
in the continuum

21:07.804 --> 21:10.673
that is the membrane between
Barbie Land and the Real World,

21:10.708 --> 21:12.972
and if you wanna be
Stereotypical Barbie
perfect again,

21:13.007 --> 21:14.941
then, baby girl,
you gotta go fix it.

21:14.976 --> 21:18.879
Or you're gonna keep
going funny.
Look at your upper thigh.

21:18.914 --> 21:20.980
-[gasps] What is that?
-That's cellulite.

21:21.015 --> 21:23.048
-That's gonna
spread everywhere.
-What?

21:23.083 --> 21:25.985
And then you're gonna
start getting sad
and mushy and complicated.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.393
-No!
-[hisses]

21:27.428 --> 21:28.691
What do I have to do?

21:28.726 --> 21:30.561
You have to go

21:30.596 --> 21:32.321
-to the Real World.
-Okay.

21:32.356 --> 21:34.400
And you have to find the girl
who's playing with you.

21:34.435 --> 21:35.731
Playing with me?

21:35.766 --> 21:37.469
We're all being played with,
babe.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.537
But usually there's some kind
of separation. Thanks.

21:39.572 --> 21:43.002
There's the girl and the doll.
And never the twain
shall cross.

21:43.037 --> 21:44.905
-The twain is crossing?
-Yes.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.072
And the girl who's playing
with you, she must be sad,

21:47.107 --> 21:49.041
and her thoughts and feelings
and humanness

21:49.076 --> 21:51.241
are interfering
with your dollness.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.045
Why would she be sad?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.850
We fixed everything so that
all women in the Real World

21:55.885 --> 21:57.313
can be happy and powerful.

21:57.348 --> 21:59.018
I don't know,
but if you ask me,

21:59.053 --> 22:00.921
-you had something
to do with this, too.
-Me?

22:00.956 --> 22:02.692
-Takes two to rip a portal.
-I can't have.

22:02.727 --> 22:04.056
I've only ever wanted

22:04.091 --> 22:05.992
for everything
to stay exactly as it is.

22:06.027 --> 22:07.664
Well, be that as it may,

22:07.699 --> 22:10.832
the two of you are becoming
inextricably intertwined.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.867
And you gotta help her
to help yourself.

22:15.938 --> 22:19.005
[girls' voices echoing faintly]

22:19.040 --> 22:20.369
So, should-- Whoo!

22:20.404 --> 22:21.909
So, what'll it be then?

22:21.944 --> 22:23.416
You can go
back to your regular life

22:23.451 --> 22:25.110
and forget any of this
ever happened,

22:25.145 --> 22:28.047
or you can know the truth
about the universe.

22:29.050 --> 22:32.381
The choice is now yours.

22:32.416 --> 22:34.185
The first one. The high heel.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.188
No. We'll do a re-do.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.354
You're supposed to
want to know.

22:38.389 --> 22:39.696
I don't.

22:39.731 --> 22:41.225
Mmm. Babe, listen.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.062
You have to want to know, okay?
Do it again.

22:43.097 --> 22:45.394
I'm not Adventure Barbie.
I'm Stereotypical Barbie.

22:45.429 --> 22:46.802
I'm like the Barbie
you think of

22:46.837 --> 22:48.474
when someone says,
"Think of a Barbie."

22:49.136 --> 22:50.938
That's me.

22:50.973 --> 22:53.941
I'm bummed. You're a bummer.
That's a bummer.

22:53.976 --> 22:56.042
Okay, I'm ready to forget now.

22:56.077 --> 22:58.451
No! You're doing this one!

22:58.486 --> 23:01.311
I just gave you a choice
so you could feel
some sense of control.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.313
-So there is no option one?
-No!

23:03.348 --> 23:06.558
You have to fix the rip
yourself.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.417
Don't blame me, blame Mattel.
They make the rules.

23:08.452 --> 23:10.496

I don't care.

No. Okay. Yeah.

23:15.030 --> 23:16.029

23:17.505 --> 23:20.132
Send me through the portal.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.639
Okay.
There's actually no portal.

23:21.674 --> 23:23.135
-Oh.
-It's a figure of speech.

23:23.170 --> 23:25.808
It's actually a sports car
to a speedboat,

23:25.843 --> 23:28.514
to a rocket ship,
to a tandem bike,

23:28.549 --> 23:31.176
to a camper van, fun,
to a snowmobile, brr,

23:31.211 --> 23:32.650
which will take you
most of the way

23:32.685 --> 23:34.278
to the state of Los Angeles,

23:34.313 --> 23:36.280
where you will don neon
and Rollerblades,

23:36.315 --> 23:38.755
and enter
the country of California.

23:38.790 --> 23:41.021
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much.

23:41.056 --> 23:43.694
And then when I get there,
how do I find this girl?

23:44.631 --> 23:46.598
You will know.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.930
Okay. And how do I get back?

23:48.965 --> 23:50.800
The same way you came,
but in reverse.

23:50.835 --> 23:53.671

do the order backward or go--

23:53.706 --> 23:55.673
-Don't overthink it.
-Oh. Okay.

23:55.708 --> 23:59.974
For you see, if you do not
find her and fix things,

24:00.009 --> 24:01.877
what's ugly will become uglier,

24:01.912 --> 24:03.813
and what's weird
will become weirder.

24:03.848 --> 24:05.683
And then you'll look like me.

24:05.718 --> 24:06.915
Ahh! Oh.

24:08.017 --> 24:09.819

24:09.854 --> 24:12.052

"I prefer to stay here."

-No.

even want you to go.

both those things incorrectly,

39:49.320 --> 39:51.496
Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer
and a senator

39:51.531 --> 39:53.256
and a Nobel Prize winner.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.928
You're a Nobel Prize winner?

39:54.963 --> 39:58.602
Oh. No, not me,
but Barbie is.

39:58.637 --> 40:00.505
Yeah.

40:00.540 --> 40:03.673
Aren't you guys gonna thank me
and give me a big hug? [laughs]

40:05.435 --> 40:07.512
For being your favorite toy?

40:07.547 --> 40:10.515
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were
like five years old.

40:10.550 --> 40:12.484
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.519
I mean, I'd play with Barbie,
but it was, like,
the last resort.

40:14.554 --> 40:15.850
I loved Barbie.

40:15.885 --> 40:17.852
-[clears throat]
-Oh.

40:17.887 --> 40:20.250
Anyways, even then,
it was horrible for us.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.350
It was horrible?

40:22.826 --> 40:24.155
Why?

40:24.190 --> 40:25.453
-Come on, Sasha.
-Give it to her.

40:25.488 --> 40:26.960
Destroy Barbie.

40:26.995 --> 40:27.994
[sighs]

40:28.029 --> 40:31.668
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

40:31.703 --> 40:34.968
You've been making women
feel bad about themselves
since you were invented.

40:35.003 --> 40:36.805
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.335
You represent everything wrong
with our culture.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.778
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

40:42.813 --> 40:46.045
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.048
Barbie is so much more
than that.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.347
Look at yourself.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.317
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.858
You set the feminist movement
back 50 years.

40:56.893 --> 40:58.959
You destroy
girls' innate sense of worth

40:58.994 --> 41:00.565
and you are killing the planet

41:00.600 --> 41:02.633
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

41:02.668 --> 41:06.868
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy
and powerful.

41:06.903 --> 41:08.705
Oh, I am powerful.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.872
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

41:10.907 --> 41:13.270
I hadn't thought about you
in years, you fascist!

41:17.540 --> 41:19.276
Oh. Um...

41:20.180 --> 41:21.685
Okay.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.182
It's happening again.
[laughing] I have to--

41:24.217 --> 41:26.019
Will you excuse me?

41:26.054 --> 41:28.351
It was really nice
talking to you.

41:35.558 --> 41:36.964
They never listen.

41:50.914 --> 41:52.617
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

41:53.543 --> 41:54.916
You respect me.

41:54.951 --> 41:56.951
Sorry, no,
do you know what time it is?

41:57.756 --> 41:59.283
No, I do not.

41:59.318 --> 42:00.790
[laughs]

42:00.825 --> 42:02.187
Okay.

42:02.222 --> 42:03.694
Why didn't Barbie tell me
about patriarchy,

42:03.729 --> 42:05.124
which, to my understanding,

42:05.159 --> 42:07.698
is where men and horses
run everything?

42:07.733 --> 42:09.227
Sure.

42:09.262 --> 42:11.031
I shall seek my fortune there.

42:11.066 --> 42:14.067
All right. So...

42:14.102 --> 42:16.740
I'll take a high-level,
high-paying job
with influence, please.

42:16.775 --> 42:18.104
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

42:18.139 --> 42:19.644
And a lot of our people
have PhDs.

42:19.679 --> 42:21.239
Isn't being a man enough?

42:21.274 --> 42:22.944
Actually, right now,
it's kind of the opposite.

42:22.979 --> 42:25.881
You guys are clearly not doing
patriarchy very well.

42:25.916 --> 42:28.950
[laughing] No!
No. We're, uh...

42:28.985 --> 42:32.448
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just... hide it better now.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.384
Oh.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.827
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

42:37.862 --> 42:39.323
-But I'm a man.
-But not a doctor.

42:39.358 --> 42:40.995
-Please?
-No.

42:41.030 --> 42:42.557
-Can I talk to a doctor?
-You are talking to a doctor.

42:42.592 --> 42:43.998
-Can you get me a coffee?
-No.

42:44.033 --> 42:45.098
-And I need a clicky pen.
-No.

42:45.133 --> 42:46.231
-And a white coat.
-No.

42:46.266 --> 42:47.804
-And a sharp thing.
-No.

42:47.839 --> 42:49.168
-There he is. Doctor!
-Somebody get security.

42:49.203 --> 42:51.434
I'd like to apply
for your job of beach.

42:51.469 --> 42:53.007
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

42:53.042 --> 42:55.603
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

42:55.638 --> 42:57.781
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

42:57.816 --> 42:59.574
There's nobody in danger here.

42:59.609 --> 43:01.851
And even if there were,
I'm not trained to save them.

43:01.886 --> 43:03.248
-[chuckles]
-Then I can't hire you.

43:03.283 --> 43:05.151
I can't even beach here!

43:07.452 --> 43:09.419
[sobbing]

43:09.454 --> 43:11.795
She thinks I'm a fascist?

43:11.830 --> 43:15.964
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

43:16.736 --> 43:18.428
[sobs]

43:18.463 --> 43:19.704
-There you are.
-Oh, no.

43:19.739 --> 43:21.596
That went terrible.

43:21.631 --> 43:25.006
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

43:28.748 --> 43:29.846
Miss Barbie?

43:29.881 --> 43:31.309
[sniffling] It's just Barbie.

43:31.344 --> 43:33.014
We're gonna need you
to come with us.

43:33.049 --> 43:35.016
Oh.

43:35.051 --> 43:36.787
-Who are you?
-We're Mattel.

43:36.822 --> 43:38.646
-Mattel?
-Mattel.

43:38.681 --> 43:40.384
Oh, thank goodness!

43:40.419 --> 43:42.452
I've gotta talk
to somebody in charge.

43:42.487 --> 43:43.959
Everything is backwards here.

43:43.994 --> 43:45.796
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.523
Girls hate me.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.701
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

43:49.736 --> 43:51.032
Need you to step this way,
ma'am.

43:51.067 --> 43:52.737
I also just learned to cry.

43:52.772 --> 43:54.871
First, I got one tear
and then I got a whole bunch.

43:54.906 --> 43:56.631
What do I do?
Do I follow Barbie

43:56.666 --> 43:59.337
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

43:59.372 --> 44:02.208
A truck car
I'd like to have, actually.

44:02.243 --> 44:05.211
You're right, she's fine.
It's Mattel.

44:05.246 --> 44:07.411
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-I know.

44:07.446 --> 44:09.314
I'll go back to Barbie Land,
and I'll tell the Kens
what I've learned.

44:09.349 --> 44:10.579
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

44:10.614 --> 44:11.580
[chuckles]

44:11.615 --> 44:13.087
Okay.

44:13.122 --> 44:14.385
-Back to Barbie Land.
-Let's go that way.

44:15.795 --> 44:17.729
-Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
-Don't call me that.

44:17.764 --> 44:20.490
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

44:20.525 --> 44:23.229
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

44:23.264 --> 44:25.770
Thank God
they arrested that nutjob.

44:25.805 --> 44:27.035
Um, um...

44:27.070 --> 44:29.268
that reality-challenged woman.

44:29.303 --> 44:30.533
She thinks she's Barbie.

44:30.568 --> 44:32.205
Wait, what did you say?

44:32.240 --> 44:35.010
She thinks she's Barbie.
She's, like, fully convinced.

44:35.045 --> 44:36.440
[gasps]

44:36.475 --> 44:38.376
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

44:38.411 --> 44:39.982
Mom. Mom!

44:40.952 --> 44:42.919
Mom, get back in the car!

44:44.791 --> 44:46.153
Are you kidding me?

44:47.893 --> 44:48.892
Mom!

44:51.061 --> 44:54.689
Mattel! Of course it was
you guys that brought me here.

44:54.724 --> 44:57.802
Because it definitely wasn't
that Sasha girl.

44:57.837 --> 45:00.134
Thanks for the ride.
This has been so much fun.

45:00.169 --> 45:03.335
[gasps]
Wow, the mothership!

-Barbie!
-We're so happy to see you.

45:10.509 --> 45:12.707
-Hi!
-[man] Would you like
some mineral water?

45:12.742 --> 45:14.049
Yes, thank you.

45:14.084 --> 45:15.347
Oh, thanks.

45:17.989 --> 45:19.989
I'm not used to that
having anything in it.

45:20.024 --> 45:22.024
[men laughing]

45:23.929 --> 45:26.094
[Barbie] Thank you.

45:26.129 --> 45:28.162
So, we've been very anxious
to get some quality
face-time with you.

45:28.197 --> 45:29.757
Of course.
So what can I do

45:29.792 --> 45:32.001
to repair the rift
in the space-time continuum,

45:32.036 --> 45:33.904
get my feet back,
and that one cellulite gone,

45:33.939 --> 45:36.566
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

45:36.601 --> 45:39.844
We have been discussing
that very topic.

45:39.879 --> 45:42.473
If you're agreeable to it,
we would love it

45:42.508 --> 45:46.048
if you could just get
into that giant box.

45:49.119 --> 45:51.020
Get into the box and you'll go
back to Barbie Land.

45:51.055 --> 45:53.517
And everything will be
as it was.

45:53.552 --> 45:56.025
You know what? We should
probably get Ken first.

45:56.060 --> 45:57.257
-Ken?
-[confused chatter]

45:57.292 --> 45:58.324
Ken.

45:58.359 --> 45:59.787
You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken.

45:59.822 --> 46:01.261
[chuckles] Oh!

46:01.296 --> 46:03.593
-Yes, Ken. Yeah.
-Ken. The guy. Yeah.

46:03.628 --> 46:05.463
[panting]

46:05.498 --> 46:08.697
Back to Barbie Land!
[laughs]

46:08.732 --> 46:11.172
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick. [retches]

46:11.207 --> 46:13.911
Ken isn't something
we're worried about.

46:15.013 --> 46:16.507
Ever.

46:16.542 --> 46:18.641
Okay, I'll just, um...
I'll get in the box then.

46:18.676 --> 46:19.851
All right! Yes!

46:19.886 --> 46:21.215
[applauding]

46:21.250 --> 46:23.646
Oh. But since I came
all this way,

46:23.681 --> 46:25.648
could I just meet
the woman in charge,

46:25.683 --> 46:27.650
your CEO?

46:27.685 --> 46:29.190
Oh, that would be me.

46:29.225 --> 46:30.554
-Oh. Your CFO.
-Me.

46:30.589 --> 46:31.995
-Your COO.
-Here.

46:32.030 --> 46:33.194
President
of the Barbie division.

46:33.229 --> 46:34.525
-Present.
-I'm a man with no power.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.692
Does that make me a woman?

46:36.727 --> 46:39.035
Are any women in charge?

46:39.070 --> 46:42.632
Listen, I know exactly
where you're going with this,

46:42.667 --> 46:45.239
and I have to say
I really resent it.

46:45.274 --> 46:48.077
We are a company
literally made of women.

46:48.112 --> 46:50.640
We had a woman CEO in the '90s.

46:50.675 --> 46:52.543
And there was another one...

46:53.612 --> 46:56.217
at some other time.

46:57.957 --> 47:00.518
So that's--
that's two right there.

47:00.553 --> 47:04.720
Women are the freaking
foundation of this very long

47:04.755 --> 47:06.425

47:06.460 --> 47:09.263
We have
gender-neutral bathrooms
up the wazoo.

love women.

47:12.235 --> 47:14.070

I'm... I'm the nephew
of a woman aunt.

47:20.243 --> 47:21.946
Some of my best friends
are Jewish.

47:23.950 --> 47:25.246
What I'm trying to say is...

47:26.282 --> 47:28.117
Get in the box, you Jezebel!

47:28.152 --> 47:29.217
[men exclaiming]

47:29.252 --> 47:30.845
What? I can't say Jezebel now?

47:30.880 --> 47:33.584
I haven't been
in a box in ages.

47:33.619 --> 47:35.058

47:36.589 --> 47:38.028
Oh, okay.

Um, before I get in the box,

47:58.413 --> 47:59.709
could I just run
to the restroom

47:59.744 --> 48:01.414
and make sure
my hair is perfect?

58:28.746 --> 58:30.504
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's cool.

58:30.539 --> 58:31.978
Where do the Kens stay?

58:32.882 --> 58:34.585
I don't know.

58:34.620 --> 58:37.214
At first I thought
the Real World was run by men.

58:37.249 --> 58:38.622
And then there was a minute

58:38.657 --> 58:41.383
where I thought
it was run by horses.

58:41.418 --> 58:44.419
But then I realized that horses
are just men extenders.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.861
-[Kens] Oh!
-[Pompadour Ken] Hmm?

58:46.896 --> 58:48.797
Oh. I had that treehouse.

58:48.832 --> 58:50.931
I saved up my allowance
to buy it.

58:50.966 --> 58:55.562
[Barbie] I've never seen
a car like that
before. What happened here?

58:55.597 --> 58:58.268
Everything,
basically everything exists

58:58.303 --> 59:01.106
to expand and elevate
the presence of men.

59:01.141 --> 59:03.042
-That's amazing.
-That's beautiful.

59:03.077 --> 59:04.406
-I know.
-[other Ken 1] Barbie's here.

59:04.441 --> 59:05.572
[other Ken 2] Uh-oh.

59:05.607 --> 59:08.652
-Ken?
-[laughs nervously]

59:08.687 --> 59:10.654
What have you done?

59:10.689 --> 59:13.316
What are you wearing?

59:13.351 --> 59:16.286
Don't question it.
Just roll with it, tiny baby.

59:16.321 --> 59:18.255
-[other Ken] Tiny baby.
-Don't call me baby.

59:18.290 --> 59:20.257
What about mini-baby?
Like this mini-fridge.

59:20.292 --> 59:21.159
[Kens laugh]

59:21.194 --> 59:22.930
No, Ken.

59:22.965 --> 59:26.296
This is my Dreamhouse.
It is my Dreamhouse! It's mine!

59:26.331 --> 59:28.397
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dreamhouse.

59:28.432 --> 59:33.974
This shall henceforth be known
as Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

59:34.009 --> 59:35.976
You don't have to say dojo
and house.

59:36.011 --> 59:37.439
And casa...

59:37.474 --> 59:39.474
But you do
because it feels good. Try it.

59:39.509 --> 59:41.751
-[both] Mojo Dojo Casa--
-No, girls. Don't say it.

59:41.786 --> 59:43.819
Mojo Dojo Casa House.

59:43.854 --> 59:45.689
[laughs]

59:45.724 --> 59:47.185
[Mattel CEO]
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

59:47.220 --> 59:50.188
Whoa, boss,
these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses

59:50.223 --> 59:52.487
are literally flying
off the shelves.

59:52.522 --> 59:56.700
The kids are clamoring
for them.
Ken is on T-shirts, mugs.

59:56.735 --> 59:58.867
-It's the number one tattoo.
-[Mattel CEO] Oh, no.

59:58.902 --> 01:00:01.837
Warner Bros. have started
auditions for the Ken movie,

01:00:01.872 --> 01:00:05.775
which is already
a blockbuster hit. [laughs]

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:07.601
It's happening. That thing
we could never imagine.

01:00:07.636 --> 01:00:09.108
If we don't get
my words lady...

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:11.044
-Executive Assistant.
-My Executive Words Lady

01:00:11.079 --> 01:00:12.441
and someone
who's probably her daughter

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:13.849
back here and close the portal,

01:00:13.884 --> 01:00:15.378
our worlds could be altered
forever.

01:00:15.413 --> 01:00:17.281
Well, what does it matter
if it's Barbie or Ken?

01:00:17.316 --> 01:00:18.645
The money is pouring in.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.889
Shame on you,
Executive Number Two.

01:00:20.924 --> 01:00:23.023
You think I spent
my entire life in boardrooms

01:00:23.058 --> 01:00:24.189
because of a bottom line?

01:00:24.224 --> 01:00:25.696
No! I got into this business

01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:27.995
because of little girls
and their dreams.

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:30.294
In the least creepy way
possible.

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:33.297
Now, blade faster.
Time is running out.

01:00:33.332 --> 01:00:35.871
Look, I'm just having
some brewski beers

01:00:35.906 --> 01:00:38.203
at my Mojo Dojo Casa House.

01:00:38.238 --> 01:00:39.842
-[all gasp]
-Ken!

01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:41.503
You can stay if you want,

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:43.208
as my bride wife,

01:00:43.243 --> 01:00:45.848
or my long-term-low-
commitment-distance girlfriend.

01:00:45.883 --> 01:00:47.410
-What do you say?
-Ugh.

01:00:48.248 --> 01:00:49.544
Brewski beer me?

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.382
I will not brewski beer you.

01:00:52.417 --> 01:00:54.923
Ha-ha-ha. That's fine.

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.760
You know, now that
you Barbies aren't around
to run everything,

01:00:56.795 --> 01:00:58.322
we can do our hair
however we like.

01:00:58.357 --> 01:00:59.686
I have hats.

01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:03.030
Where are my hungry boys?
Who wants snacks?

01:01:03.065 --> 01:01:05.032
Barbie,
I am so happy to see you.

01:01:05.067 --> 01:01:06.264
Can you believe
what is happening?

01:01:06.299 --> 01:01:07.903
I know. Isn't it great?

01:01:07.938 --> 01:01:10.499
Anyone need a brewski beer?

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:13.172
What are you doing?
You're a doctor.

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:15.042
I like being
a helpful decoration.

01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:17.913
And Allan likes to help me give
all the Kens foot massages.

01:01:17.948 --> 01:01:19.211
No, I don't, I don't like that.

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.180
[both] We love it.

01:01:21.215 --> 01:01:22.511
-Ugh, so gross.
-I'm so blotto-faced
day-drunk right now.

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:23.512
[laughs]

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:25.448
Ditto same-same that.

01:01:25.483 --> 01:01:26.955
[Brunette Barbie 2]
I like not having to make
any decisions.

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:29.386
It's like a spa day
for my brain. Forever.

01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:31.223
What is wrong with them?

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:32.686
We just explained to them
the immaculate,

01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:34.259
impeccable seamless
garment of logic

01:01:34.294 --> 01:01:35.799
that is patriarchy,
and they crumbled.

01:01:35.834 --> 01:01:38.065
Oh, my God.
This is like in the 1500s

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.869
with the indigenous people
and smallpox.

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:41.398
They had no defenses
against it.

01:01:41.433 --> 01:01:44.632
Yeah. Buckle up, babe.
[chuckles]

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.976
Because Barbie Land
is now Ken Land.

01:01:48.011 --> 01:01:50.605
And it's gonna be just like
Century City in Los Angeles,

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.883
because they had it all
figured out in Century City.

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:56.281
The minute you get
out of your car, you're like,

01:01:56.316 --> 01:01:58.921
"I can't believe
how great this place is!"

01:01:58.956 --> 01:02:01.418
No, no, no. They don't have it
figured out in Century City

01:02:01.453 --> 01:02:03.552
because we failed them.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:05.796
[loudly] No! You failed me!

01:02:05.831 --> 01:02:07.391
[sighs]

01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:09.195
-[melancholy music playing]
-[breath trembles]

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.200
Out there, I was somebody.

01:02:16.138 --> 01:02:17.940
And when I walked
down the street...

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:22.846
people respected me
just for who I am.

01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:29.820
[scoffs] One lady, she even
asked me for the time.

01:02:29.855 --> 01:02:30.777
No way!

01:02:30.812 --> 01:02:32.284
Way. [chuckles]

01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:36.519
And if it weren't
for these technicalities

01:02:36.554 --> 01:02:38.994
like MBAs, medical degrees,

01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:44.098
and I don't know,
swim lessons, I could
have ruled that world.

01:02:44.133 --> 01:02:45.693
But I don't need
any of those things here.

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:46.870
[chuckles lightly]

01:02:46.905 --> 01:02:50.203
[car bonnet squeaking]

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:55.208
Here, I'm just a dude.
And you know what?

01:02:59.577 --> 01:03:00.642
That's enough.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:01.918
TV remote.

01:03:06.386 --> 01:03:07.649
Which one is it?

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.486
Oh, it's that one right there.

01:03:09.521 --> 01:03:11.554
[Reporter Barbie laughs]

You can't do this.

01:03:44.193 --> 01:03:45.720
This is Barbie Land.

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.755
The Barbies worked hard
and they dreamed hard

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.659
to make it
everything that it is. You--

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:54.003
You can't just
undo it in a day.

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:56.269
Literally and figuratively,
watch me.

01:03:57.371 --> 01:04:01.571

Barbie's Mojo Dojo
Casa House.

It is not fun, is it?

-These are archival.

Honey.

01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:34.433
Why did you wish me
to your messed-up world

01:05:34.468 --> 01:05:38.503
using your complicated
human thoughts and feelings?

01:05:38.538 --> 01:05:41.572
-What?
-Barbie Land
was perfect before.

01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:45.444
I was perfect before.

01:05:45.479 --> 01:05:49.052
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't trying to do anything.

01:05:49.087 --> 01:05:50.317
-[objects clattering]
-Don't apologize.

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:52.715
Don't blame my mom.

[Sasha's mom] Aw, Sasha,
that's sweet.

01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:57.555
Maybe you wished us.
Maybe it's your fault, Barbie.

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:58.886
[Barbie] No,
I didn't wish anything.

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:02.131
I've never wanted
anything to change.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:07.400
Oh, honey, that's life.
It's all change.

01:06:08.403 --> 01:06:09.831
That's...

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:11.503
That's terrifying.

[somber music playing]

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:16.805
I don't want that.

[music swelling]

01:06:18.215 --> 01:06:20.908
Not my life. No, thank you.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:24.252
Just, no, I don't want this.

[sighs]

01:06:30.788 --> 01:06:33.327
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait and hope

01:06:33.362 --> 01:06:36.099
that one of the more
leadership-oriented Barbies

01:06:36.134 --> 01:06:38.101
just snaps out of it

01:06:38.136 --> 01:06:40.103
and does something
about this whole mess.

01:06:40.138 --> 01:06:42.765
I really understand
this feeling.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.900
It's basically, like, being
a human person all the time--

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.078
Please just leave me here.
Just leave me.

01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:52.038
Go back to your messed-up world
and just leave me to mine.

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:54.282
-So, you're just gonna give up?
-[Barbie] Yes.

01:06:54.317 --> 01:06:55.976
[body squeaking]

01:06:59.124 --> 01:07:00.618
Okay.

01:07:00.653 --> 01:07:02.224
[Sasha] You know,
I almost feel bad for you,

01:07:02.259 --> 01:07:04.787
but you are exactly
what I thought you were.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:06.987

01:14:41.245 --> 01:14:44.554
but also always
be looking out
for other people.

01:14:44.589 --> 01:14:47.722
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane,

01:14:47.757 --> 01:14:50.692
but if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining.

01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:53.255
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:54.663
that you tempt them too much

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:56.324
or that you threaten
other women

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.029
because you're supposed to be
a part of the sisterhood

01:14:58.064 --> 01:14:59.767
but always stand out.

01:14:59.802 --> 01:15:02.429
And always be grateful.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.332
But never forget
that the system is rigged,

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.872
so find a way
to acknowledge that

01:15:05.907 --> 01:15:07.940
but also always be grateful.

01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.942
You have to never get old,

01:15:09.977 --> 01:15:12.879
never be rude,
never show off,

01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:15.178
never be selfish,
never fall down,

01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:17.180
never fail, never show fear,

01:15:17.215 --> 01:15:19.050
never get out of line.

01:15:19.085 --> 01:15:21.690
It's too hard,
it's too contradictory,

01:15:21.725 --> 01:15:24.726
and nobody gives you a medal
or says thank you.

01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:26.255
And it turns out, in fact,

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.520
that not only
are you doing everything wrong

01:15:27.555 --> 01:15:29.995
but also
everything is your fault.

01:15:32.131 --> 01:15:33.064
[sighs]

01:15:35.101 --> 01:15:38.707
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:42.612
and every single other woman

01:15:42.647 --> 01:15:47.012
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us.

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.314
And if all of that

01:15:53.317 --> 01:15:56.087
is also true for a doll

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:01.422
just representing a woman...

01:16:03.965 --> 01:16:06.526
then I don't even know.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:13.643
Wait.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:17.306
I did write a book.

01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:19.440
It's like I've been in a dream,

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:22.476
where I was somehow
really invested

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:25.281
in the Zack Snyder cut
of<i> Justice League.</i>

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.022
But what you said
broke me out of it.

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:31.859
Really?

01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:33.025
Yeah.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.994
You're back. She's back.

01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:37.326
By giving voice
to the cognitive
dissonance required

01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:38.965
to be a woman
under the patriarchy,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.066
-you robbed it of its power.
-Yes.

01:16:42.707 --> 01:16:44.102
Wow, I just said all of that.

01:16:44.137 --> 01:16:46.676
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

01:16:46.711 --> 01:16:50.009
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

01:16:50.044 --> 01:16:52.110
We have to stop the Kens.

01:16:52.145 --> 01:16:54.442
And you need to say
all of those things
to the other Barbies.

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:55.817
-That's the key.
-Got it.

01:16:55.852 --> 01:16:57.148
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

01:16:57.183 --> 01:16:58.721
away from their Kens?

01:16:58.756 --> 01:17:00.283
We have experience
with a world like this one.

01:17:00.318 --> 01:17:01.790
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:03.825
What do you think?

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:04.826
[whirring]

01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:08.291
-Wow.
-[Weird Barbie] Thanks.
I built it.

01:17:08.326 --> 01:17:09.556
Okay, here's the deal.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.195
It's not just about
how they see us,

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:12.966
it's about
how they see themselves.

01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:15.903
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

01:17:15.938 --> 01:17:18.873
First we have to get
the Barbies
away from their Kens.

01:17:18.908 --> 01:17:22.173
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.504
-That should be you.
-Cool.

01:17:25.178 --> 01:17:26.782
[rousing pop music playing]

[Sasha]<i> Distract them</i>

<i> helpless and confused.</i>

01:17:33.054 --> 01:17:35.351
<i> Kens cannot resist</i>

01:17:35.386 --> 01:17:37.859
[Sasha's mom]<i> You have</i>

01:17:37.894 --> 01:17:39.762
<i> That they have the power.</i>

<i> And when their guard is down,</i>

The influence that Porsche 356

01:17:47.464 --> 01:17:49.596
has had on the motoring world
as a whole,

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.872
it can't be overstated.

01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:53.171
Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

01:17:53.206 --> 01:17:55.503
I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:57.373
Honey, you can only use
the Select tool

01:17:57.408 --> 01:17:58.880
if the layer is highlighted.

01:17:58.915 --> 01:17:59.947
Let me show you.

01:17:59.982 --> 01:18:01.443
My tiny head is just swimming

01:18:01.478 --> 01:18:03.412
with technical jargon
like color bands...

01:18:03.447 --> 01:18:06.217
-Oh! Hi.
-...and magnetic lassos
and bit maps.

01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.417
Do you think that you and your
strong arms can explain...

01:18:08.452 --> 01:18:10.518
-Oh! What's happening?
-[Barbie] Allan, go around!

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:11.453
[President Barbie] Ahh!

01:18:12.797 --> 01:18:14.258
-Oh, but what about Ken?
-No, no, no!

01:18:14.293 --> 01:18:17.030
-No, but I love him!
-[Barbie] Come on, Allan!

01:18:17.065 --> 01:18:19.527
[President Barbie] Hey!
What's gonna happen to Ken?

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:20.935
[Sasha's mom] Just listen.

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:22.365
You have to be their mommies

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.971
but not remind them
of their mommy.

01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:26.138
Any power you have
must be masked under a giggle.

01:18:26.173 --> 01:18:27.172
[ding]

01:18:28.846 --> 01:18:29.878
What happened?

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:31.440
One minute I was president,

01:18:31.475 --> 01:18:34.278
and the next I was cutting
a Ken steak for him.

01:18:34.313 --> 01:18:36.379
Welcome back, Madam President.

01:18:36.414 --> 01:18:39.822
Then we'll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies
to our cause.

01:18:39.857 --> 01:18:42.088
[Barbie]<i> They can be</i>

01:18:49.427 --> 01:18:50.657
<i> The Godfather.</i>

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.296
I've never seen it.

01:18:52.331 --> 01:18:54.100
Oh, my God.
You've never seen
<i> The Godfather?</i>

01:18:54.135 --> 01:18:56.333
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

01:18:56.368 --> 01:18:57.939
and a triumph for Robert Evans

01:18:57.974 --> 01:18:59.567
and the architecture
of the '70s studio system.

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:00.909
[President Barbie] Can you
start the movie over

01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:02.405
and just talk
through the whole thing?

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.275
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.914
without damaging their egos.

01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:07.410
Because if you say yes to them,
you're a tramp,

01:19:07.445 --> 01:19:09.346

Another one,

I just have all my money
in a savings account.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.324
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

01:19:20.359 --> 01:19:21.622
corporate bonds, CDs.

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:23.426
No one has CDs anymore.

01:19:23.461 --> 01:19:26.165
Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute
when you're confused.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.969
But no, not music.

[Kens] Here, let us show you.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:19.020

until every single Barbie

01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:21.748
is deprogrammed and ready
to take back Barbie Land.

-Yes!
-Yes!

to change the Constitution,

01:20:33.036 --> 01:20:34.497
so we have to get there first.

The final stage of our plan,

01:20:36.072 --> 01:20:38.369
to turn the Kens
against each other.

01:20:38.404 --> 01:20:40.701
Now that they think
they have power over you,

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:42.945
you make them question whether
they have enough power

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.441
over each other.

01:20:44.476 --> 01:20:46.740

What if he doesn't...

01:20:49.613 --> 01:20:51.052
like me anymore?

01:20:52.418 --> 01:20:55.320
-He likes you.
-He was really upset.

01:20:56.587 --> 01:20:58.422
Because he likes you.

01:20:58.457 --> 01:21:00.127
And because he knows deep down

01:21:00.162 --> 01:21:02.294
that you don't like him
the same way.

01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:04.065
It still doesn't mean
I want to hurt him.

He took your house.

01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:08.696

-Land of the free and the men.

01:21:57.648 --> 01:21:59.318
Right. Well, this place is...

And the Kens really
are just better at ruling

patriarchy and you know,
made a patriarchy.

01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:21.610
[Ken breathing heavily]

01:32:21.645 --> 01:32:22.842
[in deep voice] Kens!

01:32:24.912 --> 01:32:27.044
-Who are we attacking, sir?
-No...

01:32:27.079 --> 01:32:28.584
[Ken chuckles nervously]

01:32:29.246 --> 01:32:30.278
No...

01:32:32.282 --> 01:32:33.787
[cries dramatically]

01:32:33.822 --> 01:32:35.624
Don't look at me!

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:38.385
[whispering] Is he crying?

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.090
Just give us a minute.

01:32:40.125 --> 01:32:42.059
[Ken sobbing in distance]

01:32:42.094 --> 01:32:43.357
[breath shudders]

01:32:45.328 --> 01:32:46.998
-Ken.
-[continues sobbing]

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.804
Are you okay?

01:32:50.839 --> 01:32:52.465
Yeah. Totally.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.269
[Barbie] It's okay
if you're crying.

01:32:54.304 --> 01:32:56.678
You know, I cried too.
It's actually kind of amazing.

01:32:56.713 --> 01:32:59.175
[Ken] I'm a liberated man.
I know crying is not weak.

01:32:59.210 --> 01:33:01.342
-[Barbie] Okay.
-[crying softly]

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:03.817
You wanna sit up for a minute?

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.984
[grunts]

01:33:07.119 --> 01:33:08.184
[sighs]

01:33:09.352 --> 01:33:11.319
This, uh...

01:33:11.354 --> 01:33:13.156
It was hard running stuff.

01:33:14.324 --> 01:33:16.225
I didn't love it. [cries]

01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:18.458
I get it.

01:33:21.628 --> 01:33:22.968
[exhales]

01:33:23.003 --> 01:33:25.003
And those mini-fridges
are so small.

01:33:25.038 --> 01:33:26.972
-[Barbie] Mm-hmm.
-You could only fit
a six pack in them.

01:33:27.007 --> 01:33:30.338
[crying] And the freezers
are basically useless.

01:33:32.177 --> 01:33:33.847
To be honest, when I found out

01:33:33.882 --> 01:33:35.442
that patriarchy wasn't
about horses,

01:33:35.477 --> 01:33:37.015
I lost interest anyway.

01:33:38.216 --> 01:33:39.512
That's okay.

01:33:40.383 --> 01:33:41.822
[sniffles]

01:33:44.684 --> 01:33:47.355
I always thought this
would be our house. [chuckles]

01:33:50.195 --> 01:33:51.359
Oh.

01:33:51.394 --> 01:33:53.999
[Ken sobs loudly]

01:33:54.034 --> 01:33:57.805
-Ken.
-[sobbing and muttering]

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.467
-I think I owe you an apology.
-Huh?

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:02.469
I'm really sorry
I took you for granted.

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:04.878
Oh.

01:34:04.913 --> 01:34:07.276
Not every night
had to be girls' night.

01:34:11.051 --> 01:34:12.820
[sighs] Thank you
for saying that.

01:34:12.855 --> 01:34:15.185
[sniffles] Thank you.

01:34:17.123 --> 01:34:20.685
Oh. I didn't mean
to suggest, uh...

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.193
I just don't know who I am
without you.

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:26.130
You're Ken.

01:34:27.133 --> 01:34:30.233
But it's "Barbie and Ken."

01:34:31.566 --> 01:34:34.468
There is no just "Ken."

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.537
That's why I was created.

01:34:37.572 --> 01:34:39.143
I only exist

01:34:40.982 --> 01:34:42.916
within the warmth of your gaze.

01:34:44.216 --> 01:34:46.579
Without it,

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:50.385
I'm just another blond guy
who can't do flips.

01:34:54.798 --> 01:34:56.798
-[dramatic music plays]
-[grunts]

01:34:56.833 --> 01:34:58.063
[crowd gasps]

01:34:59.165 --> 01:35:00.593
[gasping]

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:04.773
Maybe it's time
to discover who Ken is.

01:35:04.808 --> 01:35:07.204
-Okay. I think I get it now.
-Okay. [chuckles]

01:35:07.239 --> 01:35:10.702
No, no, no!
This isn't the answer.

01:35:10.737 --> 01:35:13.111
-[smacks]
-[crowd gasps]

01:35:13.146 --> 01:35:14.475
[Ken] I feel so stupid.

01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:15.949
-[Pompadour Ken] No.
-[Tall Ken] No.

01:35:15.984 --> 01:35:18.413
-[crying] I look so stupid.
-[Barbies] Yeah.

01:35:18.448 --> 01:35:20.888
I look so stupid!

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:24.221
-No! [crying]
-So cool. You look so cool.

01:35:24.256 --> 01:35:26.718
Okay. Ken,
you have to figure out

01:35:26.753 --> 01:35:28.489
who you are without me.

01:35:29.327 --> 01:35:31.228
[sighs] Why?

01:35:31.263 --> 01:35:33.065
You're not your girlfriend.

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.936
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

01:35:35.971 --> 01:35:37.905
-Beach?
-[Barbie] Nope.

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.940
You're not even beach.

01:35:39.975 --> 01:35:44.076
Maybe all the things
that you thought made you you

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:48.047
aren't... really you.

01:35:52.856 --> 01:35:55.285
Maybe it's Barbie and...

01:35:57.454 --> 01:35:58.959
it's Ken.

01:36:02.195 --> 01:36:05.328
Ken is...

01:36:07.134 --> 01:36:08.001
me?

01:36:08.036 --> 01:36:09.266
Yes.

01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:12.038
Ken is me!

01:36:13.338 --> 01:36:15.008
And I'm Barbie.

01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:17.604
[soft uplifting music playing]

01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:18.979
Ken...

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:21.707
is me!

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:22.851
Ken is me!

01:36:22.886 --> 01:36:24.314
-Ken is me!
-Ken is me!

01:36:24.349 --> 01:36:25.645
[Ken laughs]

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.712
I don't even care
about being Ken anymore.

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:27.889
I just miss my friend Barbie!

01:36:27.924 --> 01:36:29.616
-That's cool!
-Barbie!

01:36:29.651 --> 01:36:31.288
-[gasps]
-I'm right here.

01:36:31.323 --> 01:36:32.322
Ken!

01:36:33.325 --> 01:36:34.192
[ding]

01:36:35.162 --> 01:36:36.689
[dramatic musical sting]

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:39.296
I want you to have it.

01:36:39.331 --> 01:36:41.463
Aw. That's nice.

01:36:41.498 --> 01:36:43.729
[sentimental music playing]

01:36:48.912 --> 01:36:51.704
We were only fighting
because we didn't know
who we were.

01:36:54.016 --> 01:36:58.678
Ken is me!

01:37:02.189 --> 01:37:03.749
[laughing]

01:37:04.928 --> 01:37:07.225
[Mattel CEO laughing]

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.930
Ken is right.

01:37:08.965 --> 01:37:11.559
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

01:37:11.594 --> 01:37:13.429
-You know?
-That's my boss.

01:37:13.464 --> 01:37:15.728
It's... [screams] Oh.

01:37:15.763 --> 01:37:17.730
Midge, gosh.

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.501
I thought we discontinued her.

01:37:19.536 --> 01:37:21.602
[panting]

01:37:21.637 --> 01:37:24.242
Look,
do you know how many times

01:37:24.277 --> 01:37:27.674
I've wanted to stand up
in a board meeting
and just say,

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:29.742
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.414
-Really?
-Let's have a company retreat

01:37:31.449 --> 01:37:33.119
-and just tickle each other.
-[executives laughing]

01:37:33.154 --> 01:37:35.286
-Someone get me.
Someone get me.
-[all laughing]

01:37:36.883 --> 01:37:38.718
-I love being tickled.
-[Kens laugh]

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:41.787
No, no, no. Don't hug me.
Don't hug me.

01:37:42.394 --> 01:37:43.459
[sighs]

01:37:44.561 --> 01:37:46.594
But thanks to the Barbies,

01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:50.037
I, too, can now relieve
myself of this heavy
existential burden

01:37:50.072 --> 01:37:54.074
while holding on to
the very real title of CEO.

01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:56.703
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

01:37:56.738 --> 01:37:58.408
to exactly the way it was.

01:37:58.443 --> 01:38:02.049
-Mister Mattel, I just--
-Please. Call me Mother.

01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:03.479
No, thank you.

01:38:03.514 --> 01:38:05.250
I don't think
that things should go back

01:38:05.285 --> 01:38:06.878
to the way that they were.

01:38:06.913 --> 01:38:10.387
No Barbie or Ken should be
living in the shadows.

01:38:10.422 --> 01:38:11.784
Or Allan.

01:38:12.754 --> 01:38:13.995
-Hey.
-Me?

01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:15.887
-Yeah.
-Oh. Hello.

01:38:15.922 --> 01:38:17.163
I just want to say,

01:38:17.198 --> 01:38:18.560
I'm sorry
we called you Weird Barbie

01:38:18.595 --> 01:38:20.133
behind your back
and also to your face.

01:38:20.168 --> 01:38:22.465
That's okay. I'm owning it.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.335
Would you like a job
in my cabinet?

01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:26.469
May I please have sanitation?

01:38:27.538 --> 01:38:29.076
It's yours.

01:38:29.111 --> 01:38:30.770
-Yeah, thank you.
-[President Barbie] All right.

01:38:30.805 --> 01:38:32.442
-Madam President.
-Oh.

01:38:32.477 --> 01:38:35.412
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

01:38:35.447 --> 01:38:39.515
Oh, I can't do that.
But maybe a lower circuit
court judgeship.

01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:41.484
We accept.
As long as we can wear robes.

01:38:41.519 --> 01:38:43.783
[narrator]<i> Well, the Kens</i>
<i> have to start somewhere.</i>

01:38:43.818 --> 01:38:45.752
<i> And one day,</i>
<i> the Kens will have</i>

01:38:45.787 --> 01:38:48.128
<i> as much power and influence</i>

01:38:48.163 --> 01:38:51.032
<i> as women have</i>
<i> in the Real World.</i>

01:38:51.067 --> 01:38:52.264
No, I don't want to.

01:38:52.299 --> 01:38:53.628
-Just go!
-I can't.

01:38:53.663 --> 01:38:56.631
-Grow up and go.
-I have an idea.

01:38:56.666 --> 01:38:58.369
Tell me your secret dream,
child.

01:38:58.404 --> 01:39:01.801
Okay,
what about Ordinary Barbie?

01:39:01.836 --> 01:39:04.837
She's not extraordinary.
She's not president
of anything,

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.113
or maybe she is.

01:39:06.148 --> 01:39:08.049
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

01:39:08.084 --> 01:39:11.448
Because it's okay
to just want to be a mom,

01:39:11.483 --> 01:39:13.813
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

01:39:13.848 --> 01:39:15.551
Or not a mom
who's also not president.

01:39:15.586 --> 01:39:17.718
She just has a flattering top,

01:39:17.753 --> 01:39:19.159
and she wants
to get through the day

01:39:19.194 --> 01:39:21.854
feeling kinda good
about herself.

01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:26.397
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:26.432 --> 01:39:27.893
Yeah,
that's going to make money.

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:31.567
Oh. Ordinary Barbie.
I love it. Fantastic.

01:39:31.602 --> 01:39:32.799
Okay, great.

01:39:32.834 --> 01:39:34.306
-Great.
-Cool.

01:39:34.341 --> 01:39:35.571
-Yes.
-We good?

01:39:35.606 --> 01:39:36.836
I think we're good, right?

01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:38.739
All right, let's begin the work

01:39:38.774 --> 01:39:41.577
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

01:39:41.612 --> 01:39:43.645
Hey, what about Barbie?

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.910
What do you mean?

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.417
[crowd] Yeah,
what about Barbie?

01:39:46.452 --> 01:39:50.553
What's her ending?
What does she get?

01:39:50.588 --> 01:39:53.358
Well, that's easy.
She's in love with Ken.

01:39:53.393 --> 01:39:55.921
-[crowd] Aw.
-That is not her ending.

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:58.066
[groans in frustration]

01:39:58.101 --> 01:40:00.167
-I'm not in love with Ken.
-[crowd] Oh.

01:40:00.202 --> 01:40:01.234
What do you want?

01:40:03.238 --> 01:40:04.699
I don't know. I'm...

01:40:06.868 --> 01:40:09.572
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore.

01:40:14.447 --> 01:40:16.282
I don't think I have an ending.

01:40:16.317 --> 01:40:18.383
[Ruth] That was
always the point.

01:40:18.418 --> 01:40:21.617
I created you
so you wouldn't have an ending.

01:40:23.258 --> 01:40:24.422
It's you.

01:40:26.888 --> 01:40:28.690
You're Ruth from Mattel.

01:40:28.725 --> 01:40:31.429
Baby, I am Mattel.

01:40:31.464 --> 01:40:34.399
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie.

01:40:34.434 --> 01:40:35.730
So, you're...

01:40:35.765 --> 01:40:38.799
Ruth Handler.
Inventor of Barbie.

01:40:38.834 --> 01:40:40.031
-[crowd gasps]
-What?

01:40:40.066 --> 01:40:41.472
That's so cool.

01:40:41.507 --> 01:40:43.738
Her ghost keeps an office
on the 17th floor.

01:40:43.773 --> 01:40:44.739
-[Ruth] What?
-What?

01:40:44.774 --> 01:40:46.477
[Ruth] You guys,

01:40:46.512 --> 01:40:49.381
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

01:40:49.416 --> 01:40:51.581
[laughing]
I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

01:40:51.616 --> 01:40:53.220
with a double mastectomy...

01:40:53.255 --> 01:40:55.420
...and tax evasion issues.
[laughing]

01:40:55.455 --> 01:40:57.983
Nobody looks like Barbie,

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:01.459
