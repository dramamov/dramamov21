[Episode 21]

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.970
If you like fish-shaped lanterns,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.360
I can get you more.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370
Judging from the details of this lantern,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.370
this is definitely
Young Master Fugui's handiwork.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.210
I knew Young Master Fugui hadn't died!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.360
He is in the Western Regions.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.130
Sister, where are you going

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.000
without saying goodbye?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.760
Qingcheng.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.780
Qingcheng.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.680
I recognize that fish-shaped lantern.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.010
Young Master Fugui isn't dead.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.120
He must be in the Western Regions now.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160
I have to find him.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.930
Don't try to stop me.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.970
Looks like you still haven't given up.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.500
Very well then.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.880
There are frequent sandstorms
in the Western Regions.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.760
I can't let you

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.440
go alone.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.650
I'll go with you.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.600
Mm.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.000
Rumu,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.040
this… this isn't the way home.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.680
Rumu,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.760
where are you taking me?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.880
Rumu,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.320
this place is…

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.240
Quan Rumu!

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.820
You've got some nerve!

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.610
How dare you bring him here?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.400
Weiyun,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.290
I've brought him to you.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.140
Do whatever you want with him.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.520
Miss Long,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.240
back then, I was possessed
by the Black Fox.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
That's why I did those terrible things
to your mother.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.320
Possessed by the Black Fox?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.710
You think that excuses everything?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.040
Miss Long,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.680
even if

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.840
you cut me

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.120
into 1,000 pieces today,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.960
I'd have no complaint.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.880
I just want you to know—

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.560
I truly loved your mother.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.920
Every time I think of her,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560
I'm filled with regret.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.840
I'm a wreck now,

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.040
and I've long wished to die.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.159
If I can die by your hand,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.840
that will be my release.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.720
Quan Rumu,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.010
before I change my mind,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.160
take your father and go home.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.920
Weiyun.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.840
Weiyun…

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.520
Quan Rumu!

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.040
I thought I made myself clear last time.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.000
Today is my birthday.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.120
Do you remember

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.600
our agreement?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.400
Master.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.880
Master?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.400
I've returned
to Sandstorm Town to get something.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.080
Lantern Wang,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.720
I have an urgent matter.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.780
Could you help me write a letter home?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.620
No problem.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.000
Thank you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.530
I'm not sure how to write it.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.640
I just want

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.720
to send my elder brother a letter

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.950
to tell him

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.600
I'm doing fine here,

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.560
so he won't worry.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.440
Hey,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.200
sir,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.530
where did you buy this lantern?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.600
There's a vendor around the corner.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.660
He seems to be from the Yiqi Alliance.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680
Right over there.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.000
Thank you.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.680
Thank you!

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.440
Miss,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.370
would you like to buy a lantern?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.200
Sir,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.440
did you

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.800
make all these yourself?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.800
That's right.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.130
I made every one of them.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.320
I know a bit of fire magic,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.520
so these lanterns
won't go out in the wind.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.720
They sell quite well.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.640
If you'd like one,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.039
I'll give you a discount.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.360
I heard you came from the Yiqi Alliance.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.270
Do you know about the Soldier?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.200
Who doesn't?

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.960
He consorted with demons.
That's strictly forbidden.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.760
Though Chief is his father,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.710
he executed him in public.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.440
Many saw it with their own eyes.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.980
Miss, why are you
suddenly asking about him?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.520
Sister,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.240
don't be sad.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.320
Let's go home.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.050
That's impossible.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.400
That's impossible.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.600
Why did you bring me here?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.280
You promised me—

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.240
every year on my birthday,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.720
you'd make it snow for me.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.530
Do you remember?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.220
Today, you really brought me here

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.480
just to let me make it snow for you?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.240
Of course not.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.650
I came to fulfill my promise to you.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:34.930

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.960
to accept it all.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.970
As for Young Master Fugui's death—

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.810
unless I see it with my own eyes,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.720
I'll never believe anyone.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.940
Qingcheng.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.100
Sister.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.700
I need to improve my cultivation faster.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.340
Do you have any better way?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.880
Of course I do.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:33.880
It's just…

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.200
Just what?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.280
Tell me!

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.880
Don't worry, Sister.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.280
Whatever you want—

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.640
I can give it to you.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.220
Qingcheng,

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.320
is this the place
you mentioned

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.320
for cultivation?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.730
What's wrong with them?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.730
The former Qianji City Lord

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.440
left behind a journal
of secret techniques.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.040
It records
how to absorb

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.480
the demonic and spiritual power of others
and make it your own.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.920
You've always been clever.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.380
You'll learn it in no time.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.120
You want me to use this method

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.040
to absorb their spiritual power?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.040
This is your so-called good method?

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.280
What else then?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.000
Sister,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.000
think about the suffering we endured
when we were weak.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.730
Think about how the Soldier
you loved most
died.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.100
Why do villains go unpunished

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.240
while the good die unjustly?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.200
All of that

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.840
is because we were too kind.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.000
We weren't ruthless enough.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.860
Come on.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.960
Just try it once,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.880
and you'll get used to it.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.440
It's not so hard.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.840
No.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.960
Absorbing their power like this

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.010
is no different from killing them.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.180
This is dark magic.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.440
Release them now.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.720
Don't you hate the Yiqi Alliance so much

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.840
and want revenge?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.280
As much as hatred

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.080
fills my heart,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.440
I won't use a method like this

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.970
to improve my cultivation.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.760
And you—

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.440
you're not allowed to do this either.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.240
Do you hear me?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.640
Fine.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.440
I understand.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.450
Is there really no other way

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.520
except this one?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.240
[Space of Joy and Sorrow]

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.770
If you seek infinite power,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.340
enter the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.730
The Space of Joy and Sorrow?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.220
By the way, Qingcheng,

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.359
the cultivation book you gave me before

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.490
mentioned the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.700
What is it exactly?

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.900
Forget it, Sister.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.099
That old monster gathered
all sorts of rare treasures,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.210
but only the Space of Joy and Sorrow

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.140
was left untouched by anyone.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.980
So what exactly
is inside

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.450
the Space of Joy and Sorrow?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
It's said

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.060
there's a tree seed inside

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.520
from the Grief Tree of Tushan.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.620
Whoever refines it

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.340
can attain the supreme Power of Love.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.400
But no one
who's ever

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.850
entered the Space of Joy and Sorrow

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.120
has come out.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.720
A tree seed…

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.880
The supreme Power of Love…

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.700
Qingcheng,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.200
I want to try.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.740
Qingcheng,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.060
please let me go in.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.200
I'm willing to pay any price.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.880
Just let me try,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.600
please?

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.760
I know you'd give your life

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.840
for the Soldier,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.720
but I won't let you take the risk.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.790
[The Quan family's dungeon at the border]

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.960
Don't you have anything

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.680
you want to say to me?

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.720
Fine.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.600
For the rest of my life,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.800
I'll stay in this dungeon

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.040
to repent for my sins.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.720
From today on,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.800
the Quan family

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.760
is yours to lead.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.480
Rumu,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.080
I know you long for freedom.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.320
I'm sorry

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.160
for holding you back.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.080
Master,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.330
we've located the Water-Control Orb.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.060
By some strange twist of fate,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.360
it ended up
in the hands of the second
prince of the Corsac Fox State.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.960
It seems he ate it.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.880
Ate it?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.520
Yes.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.520
Definitely

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.660
not something I expected.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.260
Master,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.760
shall we send someone

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.080
to the Corsac Fox State?

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.720
No need.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.440
The Western Regions are complicated.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.840
We shouldn't make a fuss.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:02.640
Oh,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.280
I heard the corsac fox royal family

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.680
is quite superstitious.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.530
Yes, Master.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.160
The entire corsac fox clan
believes in astrology.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.720
Astrology…

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.440
Mm.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.480
Young Master.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.040
Hm?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.280
Time for sword practice.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.700
Are you feeling any better today?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.000
Much better.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.240
But look—

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.020
it's not even dawn yet.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.760
Because you said this is the time

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.020
you practiced swordsmanship every day.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600
Who told you that?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.360
You did.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:54.880
Did I?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.200
That was the old me.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.440
It's alright.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.280
I'm not in a hurry

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.720
to get the Water-Control Orb out.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.760
I'm not in a hurry

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.270
to win Li Xueyang's heart either.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.200
Sleep well.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.400
Mm.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.120
We're done with spiritual techniques
for now.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.780
Next up is physical strength.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.320
Master,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080
if I just keep
training like this every day,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.600
can I really extract
the Water-Control Orb?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.760
Of course.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.810
The Water-Control Orb
holds violent energy,

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.320
yet this poor dog

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.850
shows no signs of backlash.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.920
Perhaps

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.060
he really can refine
the Water-Control Orb.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.210
No slacking.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.340
More training?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.160
Yes!

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.260
Prince Yunfei!

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.770
Greetings, Prince Yunfei.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.440
His Majesty has paid a great sum

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.880
to invite a renowned astrologer

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.480
to perform a ritual
to bless the Corsac Fox State.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.940
I'm here to bring you over.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.250
Go ahead.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.440
Astrologer?

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.610
[Fei]

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.200
Your Majesty.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.480
Prince Yunfei is the one chosen by fate
to lead the Corsac Fox State.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.360
However,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.840
there is still one tribulation
he must overcome

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.640
before he can claim the throne.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.200
Can this tribulation be overcome?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.960
There is a way, of course.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.600
All things in this world

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.660
follow the principle of yin and yang,

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.960
and the five elements
generate and restrain each other.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.290
Follow the flow, and prosperity follows.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.650
Go against it, and you defy Heaven.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.570
What does that mean?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.850
As long as Prince Yunfei

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.080
follows Heaven's will,
he can avoid disaster,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.160
inherit the throne,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.130
and ensure 500 years of prosperity

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.930
for the Western Regions.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.560
The fox clan will thrive!

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.900
Really? That's wonderful!

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.600
Heaven's will—

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.800
what exactly is it?

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.710
From what I see,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.000
Prince Yunfei has recently
encountered someone special.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.660
It's a romantic tribulation.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.920
Not only that—

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560
this tribulation

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.880
is tied to destiny.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.970
Tied to destiny?

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.120
Sir,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.420
am I truly fated to be with her?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.760
You must be Prince Yunfei.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.180
Come, come.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.560
Let me do a thorough reading for you.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.960
Come on.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.660
From what I see,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.280
your destined one

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.600
seems

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.160
to be linked to the military.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:28.960
You're…

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.600
incredibly accurate.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.600
She really is a general.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.220
Sir,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.730
is Li Xueyang truly my destined one?

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.120
She is your heavenly fate.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.760
But,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.280
to know whether this blessing will last,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.360
I need to perform

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.600
more detailed divination.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.280
Wait.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.580
Why are you shaking your head?

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.040
What's with the frown?

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.320
The prince's master is here.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.000
Master.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880
Master?

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:29.720
Yes.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.720
He's been guiding me in both demonic arts
and spiritual techniques.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.320
Master,

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.670
this astrologer is really amazing!

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.790
He just said

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.380
Li Xueyang and I are destined
to be together.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.570
Sounds impressive.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.580
It's true.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.040
Father,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.040
I want this astrologer

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.840
to serve as my tutor too.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.680
Alright.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.600
The Eight Celestial Lodestars

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.200
and the signs from Brahma

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.760
all show
that Prince Yunfei

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.140
and General Li are a fated match.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.200
If they wed,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.720
the Corsac Fox State

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.520
will thrive,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.080
and all disasters will be averted.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.160
Since you're so skilled,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.320
could I ask you

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.800
to do a reading for me as well?

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.400
To connect with all things

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.320
is the only way
to fully perceive heaven and earth.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.920
This is extremely exhausting.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.120
I'm afraid

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.400
I can't do that again today.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.360
Royal Master.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.960
Royal Master.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.960
What do you think of this astrologer?

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.000
Could he assist Yunfei

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.600
with you?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.080
Though I'm too exhausted

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.420
to do another reading,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.240
from your face alone,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.400
I can tell you are

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.640
a man of kindness

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.680
and loyalty

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:54.920
and care a lot

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.320
for your family.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.380
What do you think, Master?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.380
Since the mood's already
built up like this…

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.600
fine.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:12.960
Great.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.920
In the Corsac Fox State,
we've always
held astrology in high regard.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.000
A heaven-sent astrologer to aid my son—

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.400
it's an auspicious sign.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.920
Yunfei,

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.990
come with me
to pay our respects to our ancestors.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.520
Let's go.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.520
Let's go.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.440
All dressed up like some creepy psychic—

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.040
you've really suffered for this role.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.000
Exactly.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.040
It ruined my personal charm.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.320
But I don't understand.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.660
These silly foxes

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.690
are too easily fooled, aren't they?

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.920
Let's go.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.760
I really didn't expect

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.620
to see you sitting here drinking.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.100
You can't tell
it's the sea buckthorn juice?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.120
Well,

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.800
I wasn't paying attention.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.400
Fugui,

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.400
why did you

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.480
give me your sword meridian?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840
You don't want it?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:24.960
Fine.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.730
If you don't want it,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960
give it back to me.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.680
It's…

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.770
impossible to give it back now.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880
I won't go all sentimental about it.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.800
Fugui,

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.360
from now on,

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.560
I'm your man.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.410
There's no need for that.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.080
Master.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.520
Your foolish apprentice is here.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520
Did he truly

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.400
swallow the Water-Control Orb?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.160
I think he's able to control it.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.120
That is the sacred relic
of the True Dragon Clan.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.600
Fugui,

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.700
don't you think

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.020
it's quite insulting…

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.490
quite a sacrilege
against this sacred relic?

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.080
True Dragon Power

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.960
knows no race.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.360
Master.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.470
Your Highness.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.280
I'm back.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.440
Oh, right.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.260
Father asked me for your title, sir.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.920
Title?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.290
What do you call him?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.320
Royal Master.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:19.640
Fine.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800
Then call me

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.520
Celestial Master.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.730
Greetings, Celestial Master.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.440
I've heard you're a prodigious talent

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.640
and have learned swordplay
from your master.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.440
Is that right?

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.320
I've learned a bit.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.480
Show me.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.400
Okay.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.760
Fugui,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.320
to be honest with you,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.880
are you sure
you didn't pick the wrong person?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.840
This guy

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.270
can handle the Water-Control Orb?

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.160
Look at that footwork—

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.760
so clumsy and incoherent,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.120
like he's drunk.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.020
Is he intoxicated or what?

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.210
Celestial Master,
are you complimenting me?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.160
Yes.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.090
You're doing great.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.030
Keep going.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.240
Fugui, is the Water-Control Orb

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.790
truly impossible to extract?

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.350
Have you tried a laxative?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.240
They work wonders.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.570
His heart is pure.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.120
He just hasn't awakened yet.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.640
I believe the little spider
is pure-hearted,

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.640
but this guy...

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.620
-Your Highness.
-Where is Qingtong?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.420
The Celestial Master says
he has a special method

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.090
that can help you awaken quickly.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.310
Go study with him.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.720
Royal Master…

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.360
Please,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.690
Celestial Master, give me some guidance.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.690
The entrance
to the Space of Joy and Sorrow

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.880
is actually inside the Asura Hall.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.560
Sister!

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.880
Sister.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.960
Qingcheng.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.440
Sister,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.680
trust me.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.080
You cannot enter
the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.740
Qingcheng,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.900
don't worry.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.500
I will definitely be fine.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.080
Fine.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Then I'll let you see with your own eyes

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.600
how terrifying it is inside.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.800
Anyone who enters
the Space of Joy and Sorrow

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.960
will surely die.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.200
If one person enters,

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.080
the entrance will be sealed,

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.040
and no one else can enter.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.520
At that point,
even if I wanted to save you,

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.800
I would have no way to.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.320
But I still want to try.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.710
Sister,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.900
is it that hard to forget Wangquan Fugui?

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.120
If you

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.170
are willing
to throw away your life for him,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.260
then I will no longer be
an obedient brother.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.080
Starting today,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.180
don't even think about
leaving Qianji City.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.840
Don't you have your own room?

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.160
I do.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.120
Fugui,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.250
I just want to have
an all-night talk with you.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.480
Talk, my foot.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.520
Actually,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.490
we can talk about your foot.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.520
I'm curious about something—

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.610
where is the little spider?

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.120
I saw her message in the woods.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.800
It said she left.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.360
But her departure

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.760
seemed a little strange.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.060
When I was exiled,
a seal was placed on me.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.480
I can't leave the Western Regions
without permission,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.800
so I haven't been able to set out

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.080
to look for her.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:22.810
However,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.139
the little spider is very clever.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:26.960
Currently,

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.920
I can sense that she's not in any danger.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.480
If there's a chance,

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.040
we'll all meet again.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.040
Since I'm here,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.480
I'll help you look for Qingtong.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.280
You came here for the Water-Control Orb,
didn't you?

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:46.920
What else?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.280
Look at how I'm dressed—

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.280
I look like some creepy psychic.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.679
I...

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.080
I don't want this either.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.080
But I told you

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.100
I saw Long Weiyun
turn into a berserk dragon.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:56.679
So,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.400
I won't just stand by and do nothing.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.200
Rumu,

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.320
the poor dog is kind-natured.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.440
Why don't we just
leave the Water-Control Orb

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.760
inside him for now?

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.100
If the poor dog

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.940
can become the master
of the Water-Control Orb,

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.960
that would be a great help to us.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.130
Drink some of it.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.460
Come on.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.160
If you don't want to talk to me, fine.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.420
Anyway, you won't eat,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.700
and I won't eat either.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.680
No matter what you do,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.340
I won't let you enter
the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.560
Sister,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
is having me by your side not enough?

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.840
He is already dead!

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.240
Is a dead man

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.840
truly more important than me,
a living person?

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.800
Qingcheng,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.140
you can trap me for a while,

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.090
but can you trap me forever?

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.440
Sister, do you still remember

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.320
when we were little spiders?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.500
Our lives were as insignificant as dust.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.770
A single breeze could blow us away.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.720
Yet, you were always full of life,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.720
encouraging me to live for myself.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.800
Now we have enough demon power

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.060
to protect ourselves,

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880
but you want to give up everything

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.960
for a person

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.440
who no longer exists.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.680
Is it really worth it?

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.970
We used to depend on each other
to survive.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.040
Now,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.940
and in the future, it will be the same.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.490
If anything happens to you,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.930
I won't go on living either.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.320
Qingcheng,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.120
the soup is a bit cold.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.240
I'll go heat it up right away.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.560
Sister,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.570
have you truly come around?

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:36.720
Yeah.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.920
You are right.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.520
Back then, we didn't have a choice.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.080
But now, we do.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.200
I'm going to live for myself

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.420
and for Young Master Fugui too.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.400
Qianji City

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.600
is our hope.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Let the past

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.880
be the past.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.920
Good.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.040
But you—

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.360
you're a boy.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.680
Don't cry all the time.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.800
No girl will want you like that.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.000
I've got you.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.160
[Qianji Hall]

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:33.920
Qingcheng,

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.740
everything you said is right,

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.240
but my fate…

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.330
I must decide it myself.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.640
[Space of Joy and Sorrow]

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.520
Who are you?

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.020
Why have you come here?

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:33.040
[Statue of Goddess]

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.170
My name is Qingtong.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.560
I have come for the Power of Love.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.600
I voluntarily accept
the trial of the Space of Joy and Sorrow.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.730
The trial of the Space of Joy and Sorrow

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.280
is this seed of the Grief Tree.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.960
Only a human or demon
whose love is truly pure and true

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.080
can make the seed take root

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.120
and gain its power.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.200
However,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.480
you must undergo
the trial of the deep-seated

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.940
hatred within your heart.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.160
If you fail,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.520
you will be consumed by hatred

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.400
and eternally frozen here.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.840
Have you truly decided

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.320
to accept this trial?

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.280
Yes.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.200
Alright.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.040
As you wish.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.840
So it's the little spider.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.640
Do you really think
that meager bit of your demon power

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.120
is enough to make the Grief Tree's seed
take root and sprout?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.560
I'd like to see

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.520
how you'll make it take root and sprout.
