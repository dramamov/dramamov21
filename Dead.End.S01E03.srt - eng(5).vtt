Yes, Anding Hospital.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.400
Lucky we've met,

You shouldn't have come back.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.960
Well, when I see criminals,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960
I have to take them down.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.400
That's police work.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.680
If citizens just let
themselves be victims,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.480
criminals will only get bolder.

Yes, Qian Xiaolong.

How's he doing?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.159
He's doing well.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.870
He likes to sing

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.820
and often recites poems to me.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.830
I'm home.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.430
The things he's done...

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.390
Isn't this pure mental illness?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.190
A psychopath!

Yeah.

What about the throat-slitting one?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.040
Clearly the work of a professional.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.810
Want a haircut?

[Eryong Barbershop]

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
Let me get a shave.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.320
Sure.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.250
Come on.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.390
Okay.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.870
Eryong?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.750
Eryong?

[Eryong Barbershop]

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.270
Hello.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320
Is my mentor here?

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.520
He's inside.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.750
Can't you hear now?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.600
It was quite late that night

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.440
when you were here.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.840
Everything was so quiet.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.270
That girl who was attacked

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.870
didn't make any noise at all?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.900
You didn't hear anything?

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.840
No, Ran.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.670
I really didn't hear anything.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.440
I was asleep.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.480
Falling asleep?

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.250
Really slept that heavily?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.840
Well, that's not fair.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.080
I did come out

to empty my chamber pot.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.360
After I went back,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.150
I fell asleep as soon as
my head hit the pillow.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.550
It's true.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.030
My wife didn't hear anything either.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.720
We couldn't help.

Ran,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.550
did you catch the guy?

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.320
Who did it?

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.000
I can't tell you that.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.320
Why don't you turn off

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.490
your TV set at night?

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.320
My TV set?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.380
I turn it off every day.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.050
The thing is,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.010
you had the volume too loud.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.080
I've been planning

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.080
to talk to you about this several times.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.880
It's fine now.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.400
I already handled it.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.390
I've talked to

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.910
your neighbors about it.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.670
Well,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.960
thank you, Ran.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.910
Forgetting to turn off the TV

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.370
caused such a big problem.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.360
You and your wife

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.710
both sleep very well.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.690
It's easy for us to fall asleep.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.010
What a blessing.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.760
That's because of my job.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.720
Every day,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.510
I have to work on customers' faces

and heads.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.390
If I don't sleep well,

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.600
I wouldn't dare do this job.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.660
My wife is the same.

Weren't you always wanting
to

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.380
ask him something?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.930
I just want to ask

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.980
if you and your wife sleep so well,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.910
why do you take so many sleeping pills?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.270
Three bottles in six months.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.080
One pill a day?

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.550
Funny thing.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.390
I heard that
before Huang Hui committed suicide,

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.050
she also took sleeping pills.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.930
No idea where she bought them.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.000
It's really strange.

do you remember which episode it was on?

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.000
Do you know what the original title novel

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.800
"Addiction to Love" was called?

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.720
Zhao,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.630
tell your Brother Eryong

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.630
what it is called.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.640
"One Last Thrill Before Death".

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.750
That's right.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.850
There's one last thrill before death.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.960
Ran, I was wrong.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.270
I'm not a decent man!

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.720
I was wrong, Ran.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.550
What are you standing there for?

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.680
Hurry with the interrogation record!

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.050
Get up.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.210
Tell us in details.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.840
Feeling better?

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.030
Let's have a chat.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.870
Go ahead.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.910
We just came back from Eryong's place.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.640
To be honest,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.200
I've been wondering,

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.870
why would Liu Ke come to my precinct?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.370
She doesn't even live around here.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.320
Because her mom is a slut.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.570
Her mom didn't want to
stay with her dad anymore.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.960
So she had an affair with
one of her former classmate.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.080
Did Liu Ke know?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.390
I don't know.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.710
I have no idea.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.200
I went out a bit late that day.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.150
I think she saw me.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.760
I couldn't let her see me, right?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.240
I had to hide.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.440
Hello?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.570
Anyone here?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.120
If she couldn't find me,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.580
she'd just go back, right?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.150
Why wasn't the child at school?

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.890
Actually, that day...

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.840
Write this down.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.510
Question everything first!

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.710
Don't interrupt her.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.330
What happened next?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.600
You already know what happened next.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.840
Eryong's wife

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.250
was also in the room, right?

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.440
Eryong...

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960
He gives his wife

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.560
sleeping pills on schedule.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.550
Why?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.080
He said...

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.020
He said

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.080
his wife

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.100
couldn't sleep without sleeping pills.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.550
Taking sleeping pills every day?

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.750
Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.390
I don't know.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.960
Anyway, Liu Aijun

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.470
isn't exactly an honest person either.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.630
You two are

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.440
in no position to judge each other.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.770
I won't go into details.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.900
What's done

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.790
is done.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.390
Let's focus on

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.480
solving the case.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.360
Everything else comes second.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.810
Let me just ask one more thing.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.880
After Liu Ke knocked on the door,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.160
which way did she go?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.790
I really don't know.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.599
I didn't dare to look.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.480
I was afraid she would see me.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.260
It's been late.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.760
You just woke up?

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.590
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.400
I need medication to fall asleep.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.800
What kind of medication?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.280
Sleeping pills.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.490
Who bought them for you?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.400
I broke my leg a while back,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.070
and it was difficult for me to walk,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.000
so I asked Eryong to buy some for me.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
On May 18th,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.110
it was raining heavily at night,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.930
did you take the pills then too?

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.440
Yes.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.550
I've been taking them for several months.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.210
Did you hear

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.680
or know about

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.080
anything that happened?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.790
A girl died that day, right?

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.940
Huang Hui's daughter.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.310
That night,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.120
she knocked on your door.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.330
I didn't hear it.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.570
Eryong heard it.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.780
Hearing something

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.050
isn't a crime, is it?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.680
Eryong said

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.950
he drugged you secretly.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.550
No,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920
I took them myself.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.520
It has nothing to do with him.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.720
You know he drugged you?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.750
What do you mean?

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.980
I took them myself.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.760
I asked him to buy them for me.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.030
Huang Hui went to your place

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.880
that night,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.000
did you know?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.590
We run a hair salon.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.810
It's open for business.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.980
Anyone can come in.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.370
There're lots of women customers.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.830
Do you know about

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.480
Huang Hui and Eryong's affair?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.450
Officer Ran,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.350
I don't believe

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.920
these alleyway rumors.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.210
Eryong and I are doing fine.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.270
If you remember anything,

and then committed murders.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.510
This was a robbery-homicide.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.840

with a victim named Liu Zining

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.440

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.510
to our current case.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.160
The female victim
was also sexually assaulted

this crime scene.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.410
14 minutes by bike.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.770
That was home invasion robbery-murder.

The suspect has already confessed.

But this particular case

is completely different

matches our current case.

confessed to crimes

he didn't commit.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.830
Thank you.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.720
What's your name?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.440
Xiaobao.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.500
What's your full name?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
Wang Dezhu.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.680
The De with double radical.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.010
The Zhu meaning pillar.

Where are your parents?

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.920
I don't have parents.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.440
Why did you steal the manhole covers?

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.750
I thought nobody wanted them.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.810
They said when people move them away,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.350
the government would replace them anyway.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.350
So you steal things
just because nobody wants them?

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.960
Sir, I really didn't know.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.680
It was all their idea.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.920
They made all the arrangements.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.110
I had no say in it.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.200
Where were you

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.660
on the evening of May 18th?

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.590
Which day?

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.480
The day it was raining heavily.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.030
Oh, that day.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.160
We were drinking that day.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.680
Where?

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.160
At...

I forgot.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.750
Just some shabby restaurant.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.640
What did you eat?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.590
What did we eat?

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680
We all got drunk,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.550
and I threw up.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.960
A huge bowl of noodles

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.440
was wasted.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.970
What did you watch on TV?

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.640
We watched

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.920
a videotape.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.210
There was a man in a trench coat

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.790
playing cards.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.460
He threw cards
like they were knives.

No criminal intent.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.200
He didn't know
stealing manhole covers was illegal.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
He didn't know how to sell them either.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.920
He followed his fellow villagers,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.450
moving things when told to.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.310
He just wanted a bite to eat.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.310
He hadn't eaten

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400

who reported first.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.730

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.140

Oh, you really shouldn't have.

It's my pleasure.

if you don't have a cigarette

it's not a big deal,

giving birth to me makes them parents,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.460

I need to ask you for a favor.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.880
What is it?

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.929
Please tell me.

[46 days left

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.150
Look at you.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.160
You believe in some serial killer,

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.230
but you got fooled by a kid.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.880
Mentor.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.190
Do you believe human nature

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.810
is inherently good or evil?

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.000
You're always thinking about
these useless things.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.760
You're usually so kind,

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.640
but during interrogations,
you're fiercer than anyone.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.030
As a neighbor,

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.330
I see everyone as good people.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.000
But as a police officer,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.640
I see everyone as potential suspects.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.150
It's because of us,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.480
that even the bad guys

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.630
have to become good.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.120
I'll go check.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.030
It's you again.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.310
Wherever there's trouble, you show up.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.960
I know you didn't bite anyone.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.510
Go.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.230

No.

My legs aren't working well.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.600
I'd like to find a stick here.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.960
Are you paying for it?

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.480
Even for a stick?

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.440
Should show some consideration,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.110
right?

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.140
The government is so rich now,

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.640
why would you care about my little bit?

Yes, we'll go get a shot.

You go get your shot.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.800
I'll get mine too.

We'll see each other again soon.
