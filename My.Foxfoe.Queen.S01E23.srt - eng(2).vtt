00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.659
Your Majesty.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.860
Please, come with me.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.859
What is going on?

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.579
The demon clan has
broken into the palace.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.900
What?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.780
Wait.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.900
Huang Gou'er?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.740
You were supposed to be dead.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.100
It's you.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.059
Murderer!

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.300
You murderer!

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340
Murderer!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.900
You planted a gu in me
and controlled me for years.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.100
You've taken so many innocent lives.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.019
Your sins can never be forgiven.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260
Murderer!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.140
You heartless murderer!

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.860
Xiling Heng.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.500
And I even called you my royal brother.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.060
You're nothing but a devil in disguise.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.060
You…

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.180
You are all demons.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.300
You were born to die.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.660
You slaughtered countless souls.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.860
You're worse
than the monsters you despise.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.580
You'll burn in hell for this.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.620
Burn in hell!

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.939
Burn in hell!

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.939
Burn in hell!

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.859
Murderer!

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.539
Burn in hell!

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.379
Burn in hell!

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.779
Murderer!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.739
Stay away from me!

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.139
I'm not a murderer!

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.219
Murderer!

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.539
Burn in hell!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.739
No!

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.539
I'm not!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.459
I'm not a murderer!

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.579
Don't touch me!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.260
Don't touch me! Go away!

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.499
Go away!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.300
Burn in hell!

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.499
Don't touch me!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.819
Burn in hell!

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.779
Don't touch me!

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.020
Go away!

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.540
Go away!

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.740
Mother.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.340
I have killed so many people.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460
So many innocent lives.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.100
I am terrified.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.420
I never wanted any of this.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.260
I really miss you right now.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.860
(Heng.)

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.099
(It was that Phoenix demon)

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.620
(who killed me.)

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.539
(She bewitched your father)

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.940
(and gave birth
to that beast, Xiling Xuan.)

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.419
(She forced me to hang myself)

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.220
(and snapped my neck.)

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.820
(I was in so much pain!)

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.820
(It was that demon who separated us.)

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.579
(Heng.)

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.460
(You must kill them all.)

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.820
Mother...

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.700
Do not worry.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.020
Blood debts will be repaid in blood.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.339
I will wipe out every last demon
on Mount Yao.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.060
I will avenge you.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.100
Even if it means dying
with those beasts.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580
You've finally come.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.140
The guards have been dealt with.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.660
Xiling Heng,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.140
no one is coming to save you tonight.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.340
If you want to kill me,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.060
then come and try.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.860
Do not rush.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.500
Did you forget
how you were locked up back then?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.540
My dear brother.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.420
It seems you still know this place best.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.300
You once told me

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.939
that the Three Pure Furnace

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.900
was purifying my demonic aura,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.060
that it could make me human again.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.820
But in truth,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.220
you only wanted to torture me.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.660
You found out.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.420
Why did you do it?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.820
Because I hate you.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.260
All of this is because of your mother.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.500
Years ago, she used
demon magic to seduce Father.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.620
And because of her,
Father neglected my mother.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.139
Even though my mother endured it all,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.299
in the end,
your mother drove her to hang herself.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.700
That is not enough.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.420
That beast of a mother of yours

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.820
actually tore my mother's neck

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.700
right before

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.739
my eyes.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.300
What are you saying?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.740
Your mother was a wicked demon.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.380
She actually let a mother die

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.620
in front of her own son.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.020
That is why I controlled you.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.619
So your beast of a mother could feel

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.300
what it is like to be killed
by her own son.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.020
Utter nonsense.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.140
Why did you force him

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.260
to kill those demons on Mount Yao?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.060
Isn't his mother supposed
to be Mount Yao's guardian?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.499
Only by watching the creatures
she should have protected

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.540
be killed by her own son

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.460
could I feel the joy of revenge.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.260
You're insane.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.019
You will burn in hell.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.820
If you want to kill me,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.499
then come and try.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.779
Your Majesty.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.220
You stand alone,
and yet you are fearless.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.219
Do you really think we didn't know

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.900
you had set traps all around here.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.819
Why not test them now?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.700
See if those traps of yours

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.660
are still of any use.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.059
Xiling Heng.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.019
I should kill you right now!

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.300
Stop.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.939
Do you really think

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.179
he is all alone

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.340
in this place?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.020
Who are you?

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.340
Mother?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.700
You...

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.100
How are you alive?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.700
You finally show yourself,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.940
Ghost Granny.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.019
You came to lure me out of hiding.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.299
Indeed.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.020
What is going on here?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.060
Why are you not dead?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.740
Heng.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.620
Now that things have come to this,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.500
I will tell you the truth
of what happened back then.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.259
Back then,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.300
your father swore
he would only ever love me.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.259
Yet,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.539
he went out and

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.299
had a child with a demon,
that beast Xiling Xuan.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.579
He pampered that child

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.099
and showed him every kindness.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.420
Because of that,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.620
you put a gu on an innocent child?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.220
All because of that?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.700
You made it sound so harmless.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.700
His mother ruined my relationship
with the late emperor.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.740
She deserves to die.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.260
Ghost Granny,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.020
you used

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.939
the sticky rice cake sent by my brother

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.220
to put a gu on me.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.220
You also spread the word
that you were dead.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.659
Then, you had Huang Gou'er

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.260
teach my brother
how to use the Mother-Child Gu.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.660
Correct?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.060
Aren't you a clever one?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.260
But I saw you die before my eyes.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.860
You were

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.699
strangled and your neck torn.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.299
She is skilled in illusion techniques.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.699
She may have done it to you as well.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.820
Heng.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.739
Heng,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.179
listen to me.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.860
Do not listen to her lies.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.259
All these years,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.180
I have never left you.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.099
Whenever you fell asleep,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.099
I would whisper in your ear,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.820
talking to you.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.859
Heng.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.820
Heng.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.739
Heng, I miss you so much.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.580
Heng...

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.420
It was that Phoenix who killed me.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.939
She forced me to hang myself

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.779
and she broke my neck.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.140
I was in so much pain.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.699
It was that demon that separated us.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.620
You must kill them all.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.740
Heng.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.260
I have always loved you.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.299
Heng.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.020
What's wrong, Heng?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.620
All of this

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.900
is a lie.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.540
Heng.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.779
Heng.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.299
You've been using me.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.099
Heng, it's not like that.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.979
I only wanted you to see

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.420
how wicked those demons truly are.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.779
Humans and demons can never coexist.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.139
Only by understanding that

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.900
will you learn to hate them.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.099
Only then

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.619
will you stay away from their kind!

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.660
Ghost Granny,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.540
you've been wrong

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.340
from the very beginning.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.539
I told my son to slay demons.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.020
What is wrong with that?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.140
The late emperor, Xiling Hao,

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.860
and my mother, A'Luan,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.300
never shared any affection.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.420
They never even had a child together.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.660
My real father

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.820
was not Xiling Hao.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.740
It was Ying Zhao.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.740
What are you saying?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.620
Look carefully.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.379
(Back then,)

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.420
(my mother and Ying Zhao were in love.)

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.660
Not long after I was born,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.860
my mother discovered
his thirst for blood.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.459
He had been hiding it from her,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.220
killing countless in the demon realm.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.379
So my mother drove him away.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.140
He continued his killing
in the mortal world.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.020
The late emperor, Xiling Hao,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.700
wanted to destroy Ying Zhao.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.820
So, he sought my mother's help.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.699
Together,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.020
they sealed that demon away.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.940
To make up for the harm
Ying Zhao caused humans,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.260
my mother asked the Emperor

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.620
to take me in as his son,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.779
so that one day
I could help the human world,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.700
and become a bridge
between humans and demons.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.179
And you,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.139
without ever knowing the truth,

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:03.220
decided I was the illegitimate son
of the late emperor and the Phoenix.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.460
You even tried
to curse the late emperor.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.300
He loved you deeply,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.420
and spared you any harsh punishment.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.020
He only sent you away from the palace.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.940
But

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.019
you convinced yourself

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.379
that he did it out of guilt.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.100
You let your jealousy

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.940
twist into hatred,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.100
and used Brother's love for you

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.979
to make him

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.660
control me.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.820
You turned me
into your tool for revenge.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.820
Ghost Granny,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.539
you are the true cause of all this.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.300
Nonsense!

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.339
What man

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.179
would ever raise another woman's child

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.339
as his own?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.060
You are the sin born
between him and that Phoenix!

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.419
Heng, don't be afraid.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.740
Mother is here.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.460
We'll kill those two demons together.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.740
Heng.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.420
Heng.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.620
So all this time,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.460
you've been lying to me.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.260
Heng.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.940
Everything I did was for your own good.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.220
For my own good?

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.980
For my own good?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.740
Do you even know
what my life has been like?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.900
I grew up in pain.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.340
I have lived inside nightmares.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.140
I have woken from nightmares at night.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.420
And every time,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.620
I saw your bloodied head
staring back at me.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.859
Now you're telling me

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.780
that none of it was real.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.660
Xiling Xuan and I...

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.540
We grew up happily together.
We played together.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.380
But after all these years,
look at what I have done to him.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.780
This is all your doing!

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.380
I,

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.540
as the Emperor,

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.219
ignored the suffering of my people,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.180
thinking only of avenging my mother.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.380
I never stopped to see right from wrong.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.220
I killed people.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.820
I killed demons.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.780
I slaughtered countless lives.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.540
Do you even know
how much blood is on my hands?

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.179
Your son

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.900
is bound for hell.
Do you understand that?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.140
Heng.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.620
What we've done is slay demons.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.580
Demons are born evil.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.939
If you don't kill them,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.860
they'll destroy the human world.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.419
By killing them,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.620
you protect the kingdom and its people.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.539
This is your duty as Emperor.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.380
We did nothing wrong.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.940
You will not go to hell.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.980
Is that true?
