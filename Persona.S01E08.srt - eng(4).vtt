We'll start eating when Mom gets back.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.630
Okay?

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.550
Okay.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.750
You're back.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.990
It smells so good.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.630
What did you make?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910
Mengmeng, I'm home.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.910
Mom, come.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.830
You even had time to do hot pot today?

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.420
The tattoo store closed early today.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.270
You don't look good; what's wrong?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.110
My stomach's been hurting.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.270
Why not go get it checked?

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.270
No need.
I've gotten medicine from the clinic.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.180
Don't worry.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.070
You can't go abroad

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.450
without any connections in Pingtan,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.460
especially with your background.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.420
This guy's name is Feichuan.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.860
Call him.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.110
He can send you abroad.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.500
(Feichuan)

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.020
How did you know someone like him?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.550
Back then, Mengmeng's grandma

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.550
told me her son died at sea
while fishing.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.140
She asked me to leave with Mengmeng.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.550
It was so sudden for me to believe it.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.860
I went around asking everyone.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.550
Only then did I learn

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.420
that he went abroad

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.230
on Feichuan's ship.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.830
That family knew you were kind

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.420
and took advantage of you.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.550
Later, someone spotted him abroad.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.700
He thought life overseas
would be better.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.110
But things turned out just the same.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.110
At the time,
I couldn't believe it at all.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.990
So, I went to Feichuan again,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.990
asking him over and over for answers.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.830
He got annoyed

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.270
and asked me,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.790
"Can't you live without that man?"

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.990
Those words

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.700
broke my last bit of hope.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.230
Just when I was about to leave,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.830
someone showed up
to mess with his business.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.020
I shouted, "Police!"

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.670
and scared the group off.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.860
He thought he owed me for that

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.270
and told me if I needed something,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.270
he'd make sure to help.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.270
I appreciate the offer,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.550
but I can't make that call.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.110
You don't believe me, do you?

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.990
Of course, I do.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.990
I believe you.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.710
I've felt terrible enough

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.990
about dragging Danshun into this.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.110
It doesn't concern you anyway.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.860
You have Mengmeng.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.260
You have your own life.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.420
I can't drag you into this.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.510
Hong,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.030
helping you is helping myself.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.790
If you leave safely,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.590
Danshun and I can also leave this place.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.590
You two are leaving, too?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.470
I mentioned it to him before,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.150
but he didn't agree at that time.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.030
Now, I finally understand

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.350
that he was waiting for you.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.990
Don't worry.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.420
Whether I make it out or not,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.150
or whether...

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.350
I swear I'll never

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.790
turn you or Danshun in.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.260
I won't say a single word

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.670
about you two.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.260
Starting today,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.770
let's just pretend we never met.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.590
Actually, Danshun told me about you.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.150
If I had that kind of nerve and courage,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.590
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.350
What do you mean?

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.670
I'm in no place to judge Danshun.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.920
I've been hiding something
from him, too.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.910
Five or six years ago,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.470
something happened to me.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.100
I was 22 and had just moved here.

(Jiankanglu Health Technology)

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.340
I didn't know anything.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.670
- And I had a kid with me.
- It's raining so hard.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.470
It's just a bit of rain.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.230
You can't handle this?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.260
I only had one thought.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.790
Someone even brought a child.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.260
How are you supposed to work?

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.110
I need to survive.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.030
My babysitter couldn't make it today,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.470
so I had to bring her.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.790
What about your sales numbers?

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.110
Who's handling your work?

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.050
There's barely anyone passing by here.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.420
Who's heading to the market next?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.650
Try to bring more people over.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.110
Can you help me watch Mengmeng?

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.950
Sure.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.990
Good girl.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.090
Sir,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.350
we're offering free checkups.
Would you like to join?

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.490
- No.
- Take a look.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.990
Ma'am.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.670
We're having a checkup event.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.150
You'll get free eggs.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.110
Mr. Ma.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.910
What brings you here?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.230
You've been working hard all day,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.470
but there's still no result.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.820
Then it's all in vain, right?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.770
Do you know where the problem is?

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.630
Look over there.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.150
Look at that lady.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.110
She's rushing off
right after buying groceries,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.030
so she's heading home
to cook for her kid.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.420
She'd just ignore you.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.230
Look at the other one.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.790
She checks everything carefully.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.790
She always haggles for everything.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.470
Earning just a few cents
can make her happy.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.910
Go talk to her.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.670
Tell her we're running a promo.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.350
We're giving away eggs for free.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.470
See if she shows up.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.990
As long as she comes,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.810
we won't let her leave easily.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.910
Go on, try again.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.750
Alright.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.310
Ma'am.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.550
We're having a special event.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.940

and free eggs.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.500
Great.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.500
Let me take you there.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.780
Just follow me.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.950
Alright.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.350
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.660
I'm Ma Weicheng, General Distributor

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.160
from Jiankanglu

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.990

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.430
You can call me Ma

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.830
or Weicheng.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.540
On behalf of our entire company,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.140
I'd like to welcome you here today.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.660
So, do you know why you're here today?

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.260
You're here to relax.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.430
And what are we here for?

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.780
We're here to give.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.900
Give what?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.950
Love

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.070
and health.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.780
That's what we call a win-win, right?

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.860
Good.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.660
First of all,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.500
I want to ask

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.540
everyone a question.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.310
You've reached this age.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.660
What is

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.070
the most important thing

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.780
in your life?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.310
Your children,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.780
your partner,

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.190
or the money in your bank account?

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.430
Of course, it's money.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.500
Ma'am, what did you say?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.270
Money.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.270
It's money.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.340
Alright, don't laugh.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.660
Let me give you an example.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.540
Let's say

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.380
your children...

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.540
You have children, right?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.380
Two sons.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.220
That's wonderful.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.780
Let's imagine one day, your children

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.430
tell you

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.740
they need money

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.780
for something urgent.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.780
Will you give them

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.620
all your savings?

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.270
Yes.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.740
Then money isn't
the most important thing to you.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.860
Were you just fooling me?

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.380
Now, let me flip the question.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.660
If one day,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.660
everyone sitting here

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.430
grows old,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.020
falls ill,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.260
and needs all of your son

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.780
and daughter-in-law's savings
for your treatment.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.540
Do you think

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.500
they'd actually do that?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.740
Not necessarily.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.910
You're not sure.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.900
Alright, that's fine.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.620
Let me share a personal story with you.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.660
When I was a kid, I was super naughty.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.660
Such a naughty boy.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.860
When I was nine,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.780
my school was about to kick me out.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.660
My homeroom teacher
called my mom to school

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.660
and told my mom

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.430
that I didn't study.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.860
Guess what my mom said?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.140
She said that it was

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.430
because what they taught
was too easy for me.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.020
That teacher was so mad.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.540
Later, when we got home,
I asked my mom,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.430
"Why did you say that?"

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.950
My mom said,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.020
"I respect you,"

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.430
"care for you,"

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.860
"and protect you as you grow up."

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.070
I'm deeply grateful to her.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.260
It's because of a mother like her

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.860
that I've come this far

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.950
without ever losing my way.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.430
Up to this day,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.340
I've started my own business

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.640
and learned to stand on my own.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.020
I truly love my mother.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.020
But five years ago,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.020
she was diagnosed

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.270
with an advanced stomach cancer.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.660
I didn't know what to do.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.380
I was still working a regular job,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.540
working for someone else,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.540
so I had to use all my salary

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.020
and every bit of my savings.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.260
I found the best doctor,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.140
used every connection we had,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.370
and finally got her admitted
to the best hospital

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.660
in our province.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.900
And she never came out again.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.740
I watched her

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.430
grow thinner and weaker

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.020
day after day.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.070
That's when I understood

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.070
what it means to be completely drained.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.070
After that, I started thinking.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.380
I asked myself

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.380
what I could've done

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.260
to change all of this,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.140
and when I should've started

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.020
to spare her all the suffering.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.430
Later, I realized

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.240
it had to start from the very beginning.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.020
From the very start,
my mom had to be healthy.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.190
She should never fall ill.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.950
She should live a healthy life
from the very start.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.310
So, when I heard

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.190
about Jiankanglu,

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.260
I put everything I had on it

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.430
without hesitation.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.540
I decided to join them.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.740
Why?

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.500
Because I wanted others

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.860
to never go through the same pain I did.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.070
I wanted

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.780
to bring health and happiness

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.020
to every parent out there

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.020
and

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.020
every child who isn't here today.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.020
Now, please close your eyes with me.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.140
Try to picture this.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.260
One day,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.260
when you grew old,

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.150
when illness came,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.780
your children

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.780
drained every bit

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.020
of their savings for you.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.260
At the office,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.430
their boss scolded them.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.260
At home,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.020
their partner complained.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.950
In the end, they lost my job,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.140
and their family fell apart.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.380
Does that make your heart ache?

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.260
So,

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.140
tell me once more:

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.380
What truly matters the most?

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.310
Is it your kids,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.780
your partner,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.620
your money,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.900
or your priceless health?

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.900
Health! Health!

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.780
(Jiankanglu Health Technology)

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.190
I want to share a quote

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.340
as a reminder for all of us.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.540
Life is like a journey.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.640
It's filled with hardships

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.480
and beauty.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.500
Your vision decides how far you can go.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.070
If what you see around you

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.430
is those better than you,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.060
that means you're moving uphill.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.340
But if you're surrounded
by people doing worse than you,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.310
then you're sliding downhill.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.020
I hope we can

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.380
keep walking

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.500
on the road of growth.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.660
Good.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.620
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Mr. Ma.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.430
By the way,

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.620
there's one more thing today.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.950
We've got a new hire.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.320
Her name is Zhang Yan.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.700
She's a single mother.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.940
Life hasn't been easy for her.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.020
So, you should treat her

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.500
like family,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.500
help her out,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.020
and understand her, alright?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.900
Sure.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.380
Welcome, welcome!

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.430
Everyone, enjoy.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.020
Mr. Ma, may I say a few words?

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.500
Thank you.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.380
Well.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.950
Let me just say a few words.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.430
What we have here really feels

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.500
like a big family.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.140
Especially Mr. Ma.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.020
He's always encouraging us.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.780
I truly admire

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.020
and respect him.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.020
I'm glad we have someone new

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.020
joining us today.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.540
I have some good news I'd like to share

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.430
with everyone.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.620
It's about me.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.260
I got into college.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.140
- Amazing!
- How amazing!

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.070
You're incredible.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.190
Thanks. I'll drink to you all first.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.140
Liu, I honestly didn't expect that.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.500
What a surprise.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.740
You were always so busy at work,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.060
yet you still found time to study.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.900
When you first joined us,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.020
I told you this:

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.780
You have a sharp mind,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.290
and as long as you work hard,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.660
there's nothing you can't achieve.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.690
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.430
Liu perfectly proves

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.430
what I just said.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.900
Everyone should learn from him

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.540
and keep moving forward

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.430
with the best, okay?

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.310
Another toast to him.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.180
- Cheers.
- Sure.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260
Drink more tonight.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.660
- Thanks, Mr. Ma.
- Congrats.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.190
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.620
Liu.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.500
You're too capable

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.670
to stay here now.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.720
- That's true.
- Thanks.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.580
Have a drink with us.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.870
- Bottom up!
- Cheers!

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.430
Make sure you drink more tonight.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.500
Congrats.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.340
Congratulations.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.270
Zhang Yan.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.850
- Mr. Ma.
- Did you gain anything today?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:30.940
Liu, have a drink with me.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.580
Yes, after hearing what you said,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.140
I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.030
I've been observing you.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:36.890
You're pretty good.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.190
You couldn't find your direction

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.190
because you didn't know

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.670
how to make the most of your talent.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.060
Honestly, doing sales isn't complicated.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.970
It's about thinking less about yourself

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.550
and paying more attention to others.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.500
Take it step by step.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.820
Gain experience little by little.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.120
Things will keep getting better.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.230
What you just said

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.100
really struck a chord with me.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.150
I feel you're
an incredibly selfless man.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.290
Our company's bound
to do better and better.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.710
Let me drink to you.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.950
No need.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.450
You still have to look after the kid.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.670
In the beginning,

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.050
I'm the one helping you.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.990
After some time,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.110
you'll be the one helping me.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.870
I'll keep working hard.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.710
Mr. Ma.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.150
Mr. Ma, let me toast to you again.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.300
Thank you
for all your support this year.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.910
I've truly learned a lot.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.820
I hope that one day,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.820
I can become someone

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.060
strong enough and care

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.500
for others like you.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.100
Though I'm heading to college now,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.990
if I have time in the future,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.390
I'll definitely come back

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.230
to visit everyone.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.630
Once you leave,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.670
can Zhang Yan take over your clients?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.950
No problem, Mr. Ma.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.760
We're out of charcoal.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.010
Can you help add some more?

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.230
Sure.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.310
Liu, what happened?

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.910
- What's wrong?
- Liu!

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.760
What happened?

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.060
Liu, are you okay?

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.390
That burn looks really bad.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.670
Zhang, grab some cold water
from the restroom.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.510
Hurry, hurry!

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.990
Are you okay?

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.660
Stop looking. Go and take care of it!

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.350
If it's serious,
take him to the hospital.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.530
Let's rinse it with water.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.100
- Go!
- Use cold water.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.940
I'll take him there.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.400
What were you thinking?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:14.870
How did this happen?

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.500
Jiankanglu for success.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.390
What a profitable business.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.300
(Way of Wellness)
What a profitable business.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.000
Health for everyone.

00:19:24.046 --> 00:19:26.407
Health for everyone.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.630
What a shared happy future.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.840
What a shared happy future.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.580
We can do this!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.670
Here, have some water.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.230
Sure, thanks.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.800
This way.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.860
The sunlight is nice here.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.990
I've saved you a good seat.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.950
Ma'am, are you feeling unwell?

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.990
No, I just came to pick up
the gift and eggs.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.820
You're sweating from the walk.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.430
Why not rest here?

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.150
Try out our therapy device.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.990
No need to bother.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.500
I need to hurry back and make dinner.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.870
I just heard

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.670
that you're giving out eggs and gifts,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.820
so I came to check.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.710
Ma'am.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.670
Here's the thing.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.230
All our gifts here

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.740
can only be claimed
after you try the product.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.230
Why not try out

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.990
our massager for a moment?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.150
It feels great.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.150
It's also quick; why not have a try?

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.740
Forget it; this is too much trouble.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.910
I'll skip it then.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.870
- Take a look at our other items.
- Please wait.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.950
Take these two with you.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.950
- Here.
- I really shouldn't.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.460
It's fine. They're free, Ma'am.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.740
I'm the person in charge here.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:27.790
My last name is Ma.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.620
In the middle of the day,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.990
you've been running around nonstop.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.460
What if you get overheated out there?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.510
How about this?

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.430
Rest here for a bit.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.460
Cool yourself.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.340
I'll find a car to take you home later.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.660
Alright.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.630
Yeah, I'm a bit thirsty.
It's crazy hot today.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.300
This way, please.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.730
How many people are in your family?

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.910
Just my husband and me.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.160
Why didn't your husband come with you?

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:53.870
Look around here.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.670
All the elderly couples came together.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.100
Older folks show affection so openly.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.470
We younger ones can't even compare.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.990
My husband

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.630
needs me to take care of him.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.190
He has hemiplegia.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.010
How long has he been ill?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.870
It's been over two years now.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.670
When he first collapsed,

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.060
he kept getting angry,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.430
complaining about his bad luck.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.060
Now,

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.950
he keeps complaining about aches.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.500
I take care of him all day long,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.100
and he still blames me for everything.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.340
I don't know what to do with him.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.600
You have to cook

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.750
and look after him every day.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.230
Your shoulders, neck, and lower back

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.710
must be under a lot of stress, right?

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.230
Of course.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.950
My back's practically hunched already.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:36.820
My whole body

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.910
hurts everywhere.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.660
Manager Zhang,

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.670
let her try

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.870
our therapy device.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.950
No need. I'm not buying anything.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.910
Don't worry.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.070
It's free.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.950
You'll make me buy it after I try it.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.150
I won't.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.990
Don't worry.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.470
I've told everyone

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.740
not to force customers to buy anything.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.820
No one's allowed to touch

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.630
her wallet. Got it?

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.470
Sure.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.470
Even if you don't buy anything,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.100
you're welcome to come
every day for a free trial.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.430
- Okay.
- Ma'am.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.950
Give it a try.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.390
It's a small token from Mr. Ma.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.580
Bring over our magnetic foot spa,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.470
so she can try it.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.630
- Let her use it.
- No need.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.010
- It's too much trouble.
- Listen.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.580
There are 81 acupoints on the foot.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.590
A short soak helps relieve
all kinds of problems.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.430
Give it a try.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.710
Alright, I'll give it a try.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.830
Ma'am,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.870
this is Manager Zhang.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.010
She's thoughtful and caring.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.190
If you ever need anything,
just go to her.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.100
Ma'am,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.150
my grandma has hemiplegia, too.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.540
I used to take care of her.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.100
Your grandma is so lucky to have you.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.740
Alright, thanks. Goodbye.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.010
- Take care, Ma'am.
- Goodbye.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:48.470
Bye.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.510
Mr. Ma.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.910
I'm sorry.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.710
I failed to get
any business again today.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.580
That's okay.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.430
If you want to win people over,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.710
first,

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.770
make them believe
you're their most genuine friend.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.430
You've known her situation well.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.870
If she comes back again,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.340
you have to make her truly feel

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.430
how much we're helping her.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.150
I believe that over time,

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.630
she'll sense your genuine care for her.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:18.710
Everyone,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:19.990
I've always said

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.190
that our philosophy

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.230
is all about sharing goodwill
with the world.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.100
Only when you keep

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.870
spreading kindness outward

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.060
will the world return
that kindness to you.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:32.920
Today,

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.730
the long-term client that Zhang Yan
has been keeping in touch with,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.900
Ms. Li Bingmei,

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.470
added 10,000 yuan to her account here

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.990
to purchase our products and services.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.230
That's genuine care
winning genuine trust.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.340
Let's give Zhang Yan
a round of applause.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.500
Have a taste of this wine.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.110
It's different from the last one.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.550
How is it?

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.510
Pretty good.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.340
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.100
I appreciate all your help lately.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.150
I should be the one
treating you to dinner.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.150
You treating me?

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.390
I'm your boss.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.580
Do you think I need that?

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.950
You earn your money the hard way.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.910
Keep it for yourself.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.950
From your accent,
you're not local to Pingtan, are you?

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.340
No.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.150
I'm from Shimen.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.630
Do you have any siblings?

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.300
Yeah, I've got a younger brother.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.100
He's still in school.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.670
Is Mengmeng going to be okay

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.870
when we're having dinner?

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.710
It's fine.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.740
I've asked a neighbor

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.340
to take care of her.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.110
It must've been hard for you.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.390
When I look at you,

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.200
it feels like I'm looking
at my younger self

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.230
when I first came to Pingtan
to make a living.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.580
I didn't know anyone or anything.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.430
Whatever kind of trouble I ran into,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.910
I had to push through it on my own.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.920
But things are even tougher for you.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.670
You've got a kid.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.150
Where's your husband?

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.950
He passed away.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.270
Sorry to hear that.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.820
It's okay.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.670
Alright, let's drop it.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.670
Come on, have a drink.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.420
Bottom-up.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.830
What's wrong?

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.420
Do you want to stop?

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.910
No.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.910
I can drink.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.910
If you don't want to, just say so.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.670
It's okay.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.500
Like when work gets tough,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.500
you should speak up.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.390
You gotta be honest with yourself.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.300
I don't like this side of you.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.390
Mr. Ma.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.670
A person should first look inward

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.230
and then learn
to feel the world outside.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.510
Got it?

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.150
It's not about you, Mr. Ma.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.470
I just can't hold my liquor.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.510
I...

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.580
Alright, come on.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.500
Stop drinking then.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.670
When I saw you for the first time,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.100
you were out in the rain
handing out flyers.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.740
No one else would go.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.900
Why were you the only one?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.090
Did you want to put on a show

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.050
to earn people's praise?

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.980
No.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.870
I just noticed no one else wanted to go.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.910
I didn't mind.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.650
You didn't mind?

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.910
Why would you be the only one?

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:05.750
I...

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.670
I've never minded anything.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.740
What?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.990
Nonsense. You're lying.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.340
Seriously, Mr. Ma.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.430
I just don't mind.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.740
When I was a kid,

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.060
my brother and I both wanted ice cream,

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.870
but my family didn't buy one for me,

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.470
and I didn't mind, either.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:24.710
Later,

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.150
I only met Mengmeng's dad once,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.670
and they suggested we get married.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.910
I didn't mind, either.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.150
None of them ever asked me.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.100
I didn't mean you had to ask me.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.340
I...

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.430
I don't know how to say it.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.740
Honestly, I don't mind.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.340
I shouldn't be telling you this.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.910
When Mengmeng's dad didn't come back

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.950
from fishing,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.470
everyone told me he was dead.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.870
I didn't ask about it, either.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.150
I didn't mind.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.870
You didn't mind?

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.300
Zhang Yan, listen.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.190
Sometimes,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.500
you're tougher than you think.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.230
But I don't need
that toughness from you.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.340
I just want to see the real you.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.630
The real me?

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.390
The real me has nothing at all.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.940
Come on.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.150
Do you know what matters most?

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.670
It's not about how many people like you

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.150
or how many love you;

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.340
it is

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.500
about whether you're worth being loved.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.340
Look at me.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.950
The woman in my eyes now

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.710
is the real you.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.670
She deserves to be treated with care.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:40.760
Mr. Ma.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.660
You're awake.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.630
Have some breakfast.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.390
I...

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.430
You were drunk last night.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.990
I helped you back to my room.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.190
I slept in the guest room.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.630
Oh, your phone's charged.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.790
Okay.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.990
Your neighbor
kept calling you last night.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.100
I answer it for you.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.390
She said Mengmeng was home alone
with no one to look after her,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.100
so I asked her to help.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.710
Remember to thank her today.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.190
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.590
If you really want to thank me,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.710
stop calling me Mr. Ma
when we're off work.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.790
Also,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.300
what I said yesterday

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.170
wasn't just the drink talking.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.340
What made you suddenly want
to go shopping with me today?

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.430
Are you in love?

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.230
No.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.950
I just got paid and wanted

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.430
to buy myself something new.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.060
This one looks good.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.100
It really suits you.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.820
You look a bit different today.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.910
Do you think this looks good on me?

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.950
I've told you.

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:45.910
What I love is the real you.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.100
What I love is the real you.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.460
(Win with Influence;
Become a Millionaire in Seven Years)

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.910
Did you sleep well?

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:11.750
Move in with me.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.310
When Ma Weicheng treated me well,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.990
he could be really nice.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.430
Bring Mengmeng, too.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.950
Though he'd done a lot of things

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.180
that really scared me...

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.350
Let me take care of you.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.100
... He also said he loved me.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.010
He said I deserve to be loved.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.820
Maybe because, since I was little,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.470
I've never been loved properly,

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:36.750
I honestly mistook that for love.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.270
But that wasn't love.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.830
That was just hurting you.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.100
He said you deserved love?

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.280
If he thought that,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.870
why control what you wear?

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.350
How is that supposed to be love?

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.350
He was just testing
how far he could push you

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:58.890
and trying to control you step by step.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:00.710
Yeah.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.700
Looking back now,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.350
I realize
that when he was nice to me at first,

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.290
it was to figure out
what kind of woman I was.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.990
He wanted to find my weak spots,

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.270
so he could use them against me.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.020
Once he saw my insecurities,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.390
I became easy for him to control.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.540
Like a trap.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.700
He drew an invisible circle around you,

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.160
and that circle kept shrinking

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.870
bit by bit

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.430
until there was only you and him inside.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.800
Then your whole world
revolved around him.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.180
You're right.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.270
Everyone got paid this afternoon,

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.750
except for me.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.350
I did that on purpose.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.100
Just messing with you.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.750
I bought an education fund for Mengmeng.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.390
It's only a few thousand each month.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.910
So, when she goes to college,

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:02.910
we won't have to worry.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.060
Look.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:14.620
That's quite a bit.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.950
It's really good.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.430
But my salary might not cover it.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.890
You've got me to help, don't you?

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.310
Now that we're together,

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.360
there's no need
to separate yours and mine.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.620
I'll put all our money

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.020
into one bank card.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.540
Whenever you need it, just tell me.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.310
Let's be more careful with spending,

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.430
and it'll be fine.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.490
We should think long-term

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:43.990
for Mengmeng

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.830
and our future.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.100
Thanks.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.940
Thank you.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.390
Ms. Xu,

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:06.430
I'll pass on the drink.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.980
Have one.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.430
It's not easy for us to get together.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.620
Take it.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:10.750
Yeah, come on.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.430
Come on, let's drink.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.270
Cheers!

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.830
Oh, Zhang Yan.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.110
My husband's cousin

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.740
came to Pingtan to visit us
a while back.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.790
After he left,
he started asking me about you.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.220
Do you have someone you like?

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.870
She's definitely seeing someone.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.910
No, I'm not.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.310
Your smile gives it away every day.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.950
We even went shopping days ago.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.790
Why aren't you wearing that dress?

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.790
Who were you planning to show it to?

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:42.870
No one.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.580
I just haven't put it on.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.060
I'm back.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.090
Did you buy the ink cartridge?

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620
I forgot.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.430
Do you need it right now?
I can go get one.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.310
Did you drink?

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.470
Everyone was having fun,

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.270
so I had a little.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.950
Do you think

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.110
what I say doesn't matter anymore?

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.870
Do you even care about me now?

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:41.750
Of course, I do.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.870
Then how could you forget?

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.900
I'll go right now...

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.150
Mengmeng.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.870
I'm here.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.750
It's okay.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.700
It's fine.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.270
It's okay, Mengmeng.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.430
I'm right here.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.460
It's alright.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.830
Do you think

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.310
I'm being selfish by not letting you

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.430
tell them about us?

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.190
No, not at all.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.910
I know you were looking out for me.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:46.750
Zhang Yan,

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.430
in this world,

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.870
not everyone is as kind as you imagine.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.470
If they find out about us,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.430
they'll talk behind your back at work.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.750
That'd be bad for you.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:58.910
I just wanted to protect you.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.350
I know.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.270
I'm sorry.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.790
I lost my temper just now.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.750
I shouldn't have gotten that angry.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:27.590
Please forgive me.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.900
Okay?

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.500
Don't hang out
with those people anymore.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.310
You've got me and Mengmeng.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:14.830
That's all you need.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.860
(Longxiang Travel & Transport Co., Ltd.)

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:29.790
I haven't gone out

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.100
for fun in years.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.830
That's sweet of you to plan this.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:38.790
Zhang,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.180
I often think

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.870
that if I had a daughter like you,

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:43.950
that would be wonderful.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:47.790
Ms. Li,

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:53.220
I'm all alone in Pingtan.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.470
I met you on my first day of work.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.540
I really think that was fate.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.350
In my heart,

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.020
I've long seen you as my mom.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:06.700
Really?

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.790
Then I'll treat you like my daughter.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.700
Don't be so polite with me.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.950
You don't have to be so polite, either.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.350
I've been watching the whole day.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.910
She's really kind to you.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:20.750
Yes.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.060
At our age,

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:24.540
the greatest blessing is

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.540
to have such a caring child
by your side.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.190
Exactly.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.750
Is your daughter married?

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.180
Is she seeing anyone?

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.630
Mom.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.620
Not yet.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.350
What does she do for work?

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.060
She works at a health products company.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.900
When you have time,

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.100
you should drop by her company.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.020
Sure.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:51.110
Once we get there,

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.270
I'll have my son drive there.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:54.750
Right.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.470
Later, you can take them there.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.900
Sure.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.060
You can rest completely assured.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.970
Our business

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.180
is definitely more reliable
than any bank investment.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.790
- Ma, I trust you.
- Thanks.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.180
Don't worry. I'll think it over.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.500
- Goodbye.
- See you.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.340
Goodbye.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.470
You're back.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:50.830
What's wrong?

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.180
Where did you go today?

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.950
I went hiking with Ms. Li. You...

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:02.790
Ms. Li?

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.270
I saw it all.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:19.950
I've worked so hard

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.870
to give you and Mengmeng a better life.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.270
Yet you went out
messing around with another guy?

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:28.110
I...

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.270
I know.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.440
Is it because you saw someone

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.730
drive me back today?

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.690
No, that's not it.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.260
His mom said she wanted a health check.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.070
- Do you think I'll buy that?
- So, he...

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.310
It's true. I've made the arrangements.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.540
I'm sorry.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:20.670
Sorry.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.700
I'm sorry.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.060
Please hear me out.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.900
I'm sorry.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.430
It's my fault.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.020
I'm sorry.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.310
Sorry.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.540
It's my fault.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:42.990
Something's wrong with me.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.180
Sorry, I just love you too much.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:54.430
When I was 15,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.790
I hid alone in my room.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.220
They thought I couldn't hear them,

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:03.910
but I actually heard everything.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.540
I walked out, knelt,

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.430
kowtowed three times to them,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:09.270
and said,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.470
"Please, don't leave."

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.270
I said...

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.190
I...

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:23.180
This is all I can do.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.500
I can't control anything.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.910
I'm sorry.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.910
Then I met you.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.540
I've felt what home means again.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.500
I'm so scared you'll leave me.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:44.950
That's why I act this way.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.270
Please, don't go.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.110
I'm begging you.

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.100
Please don't leave me.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.270
Please.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.790
I don't have a home anymore.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:57.830
I'm begging you.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.390
Go ahead, hit me.

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.580
Hit me if you have to.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.830
Please, I'm begging you. Okay?

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.190
Please.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.790
I've lost my home.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.950
I don't have a home now.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.700
One day, I was cleaning up the house.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.270
I opened one of his books,

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.620
and I realized everything he said
about his childhood

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.910
(My mother)
was all made up.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.220
It was exactly the same
as what's written in the book.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.260
(A child from a struggling family)

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.700
Every story he told me

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.620
was a lie.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.870
It was just an act.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.910
It was completely a way to control me.

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:50.500
That's how he took advantage

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.910
of my feelings.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.010
He knew I had a soft heart.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.310
He pushed until my boundaries broke.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.500
He's a total scumbag.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.620
His mind's completely twisted.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.830
When faced
with something humiliating like that,

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.430
he must've resolved to violence.

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:15.700
He must've hit you very hard.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.100
But I've read those books now.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.470
However foolish I might be,

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.850
I knew he wasn't the one
who needed saving.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.020
The one who needed saving was me.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.320
A shameless man like him

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:37.060
would never let you walk away easily.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:50.230
Mengmeng.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.270
Zhang Yan.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.350
Step aside.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.210
Move aside.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.430
Zhang Yan, calm down.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:00.270
Step aside.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:05.350
Ma Weicheng.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.060
Give Mengmeng back to me.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:15.180
Give Mengmeng back to me!

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.220
Ma Weicheng!

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.420
You want to leave?

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:36.950
You want to leave now?

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.270
Mengmeng!

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.620
Go on then! Leave!

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.060
If you dare leave,

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.100
I'll kill both you and Mengmeng.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.100
I mean what I say.
