00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.864
And tell your boss this…

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.235
Stay away from my boss.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.157
Kongtup’s already making his move.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.137
You’ll have to be even more careful from now on.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.749
This is no big deal.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:49.500
Are you saying I’m bossy?

00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:51.229
Is what you’re doing not being bossy?

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.000
You’re forcing me to accept your apology.

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:55.594
I warned you.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.181
If you keep being stubborn.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.814
I’ll kiss you right here.

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:00.806
I’m putting my earphones on.

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.193
You can sing as loud as you want, or do whatever you like.

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:04.119
I won’t hear anything.

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:05.247
I didn’t think…

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:07.327
Babe would be this cute.

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:10.715
Her name is Bo.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.566
I have to work at the club today.

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:15.626
I’ll drop you off at the club first.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.843
After I finish work…

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.000
I’ll come join you.

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.307
This way, Queen.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.221
Bie has already let me know you’d be coming.

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.151
Please, have a seat at your table.

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:29.131
Where’s the girl who told you?

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:35.150
Bie’s already been booked for the night.

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.435
I sincerely apologize.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:59.432
Would you like me to send someone else to serve you?

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.401
No.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.012
I’ll handle it myself.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.814
Yes.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.347
Please, Queen.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:06.434
Please, excuse me.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:28.961
What do you want?

00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:34.783
People can’t be trusted these days, Queen.

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.135
It could be that…

00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.803
Your throne might be shaken.

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.749
Because you’ve shown your weakness without realizing.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.223
Stop talking nonsense.

00:04:59.848 --> 00:05:00.675
If…

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:04.124
I wanted to buy your secrets from this girl.

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.238
Do you think I could?

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:14.121
Ask her then.

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:16.954
I’d like to know that too.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:25.484
So?

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:28.066
Are you interested in working for me?

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.599
I could pay you much more than Queen.

00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:47.441
Thinking too long…

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.589
I won’t.

00:05:52.157 --> 00:05:54.000
Words like that can’t be trusted.

00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:56.684
What do you want from me?

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:09.590
Drink this.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.010
Have a drink with me.

00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:28.379
Don’t play dirty.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:31.912
You’re better than that…

00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:32.959
Kongtup.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:38.844
If you don’t want your girl to drink.

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:41.064
Then you drink instead.

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:47.136
So, it’s poisoned, right?

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:49.524
That’s why you want me to drink it that much.

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:54.293
Take a risk then.

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.769
Just like we used to play when we were kids.

00:07:03.612 --> 00:07:04.579
If I die…

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.251
King will make your death far more painful.

00:07:12.128 --> 00:07:12.899
I know.

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.018
And if I suffer…

00:07:18.857 --> 00:07:21.639
He’ll make you suffer even more.

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.031
What’s going on?!

00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:37.711
If I die…

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.121
What are you saying?!

00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:45.644
I know you wouldn’t be sad.

00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:52.806
If you can’t talk nicely.

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:54.441
Then just stop talking.

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:11.730
So?

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:14.257
Who’s the one dying this time?

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:18.137
You got some nerve.

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:21.532
If it’s actually poisoned…

00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:24.000
What did you put in there?!

00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:31.387
Just calm down, Queen.

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:32.728
What did you put in there?!

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.333
It’s just…

00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:47.358
an aphrodisiac.

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.053
You wanted me to take an aphrodisiac?!

00:08:51.892 --> 00:08:53.445
But there’s nothing to worry about, Queen.

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.443
It’s a new formula.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.683
It acts fast.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.345
Just a little painful.

00:09:01.692 --> 00:09:03.608
But if you take your girl out right now.

00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.917
There might still be time to help her.

00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:07.993
Shut up!

00:09:09.888 --> 00:09:11.888
Stop pretending you’re a good person, Queen.

00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:18.464
If my girl suffers at all.

00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.856
I will make you suffer far worse.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.202
You can’t blame me for this, Queen.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.008
Your girl chose to drink it herself.

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:34.663
Let me know how it turns out.

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:49.798
Have a great night…

00:09:51.163 --> 00:09:52.102
Queen.

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:24.000
Come with me.

00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:25.489
Sam!

00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:25.989
Yes!

00:10:25.989 --> 00:10:26.491
The car!

00:10:32.772 --> 00:10:33.516
Stop.

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:53.609
What have you done?!

00:10:54.332 --> 00:10:55.355
I won’t let you die.

00:11:02.193 --> 00:11:03.104
What’s so funny?

00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:04.355
I just…

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:05.646
like the answer.

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:08.229
Is this really the time?

00:11:11.074 --> 00:11:11.734
I’m sorry.

00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:15.954
We’re going to the hospital.

00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:17.001
I won’t.

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:19.193
Babe!

00:11:21.284 --> 00:11:22.028
Don’t be stubborn.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.605
I’m fine.

00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:27.724
Can you stop talking back to me for once?

00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:31.534
Why are you mad at me?

00:11:32.508 --> 00:11:34.062
You’re the one who made me do this.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.198
What did I do?

00:11:37.953 --> 00:11:38.808
You don’t trust me.

00:11:44.852 --> 00:11:46.601
Please don’t take me to the hospital.

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:48.000
I don’t want to go.

00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.437
Sam!

00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:54.937
Yes?

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:56.295
We’re going home.

00:11:56.822 --> 00:11:57.342
Yes.

00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:28.049
Stay here.

00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:51.605
Why did you take your shirt off?!

00:12:52.384 --> 00:12:53.267
I’m hot.

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:05.090
What are you doing?!

00:13:05.282 --> 00:13:07.058
If you’re not going to help then stay out of the way.

00:13:07.058 --> 00:13:08.444
I’ll have someone else help me.

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:15.383
If it isn’t me…

00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:17.575
No one else has the right.

00:13:25.474 --> 00:13:26.413
Go take a shower.

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:33.687
Are you really that good of a person?

00:13:35.135 --> 00:13:37.610
Why are you being nice when I don’t want it?

00:13:42.772 --> 00:13:43.906
But when I didn’t allow you...

00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:46.267
You forced me anyway.

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.372
If you’re not helping then just stay out of the way.

00:14:57.285 --> 00:14:58.643
Don’t you know how to squeeze?

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.749
Don’t just talk.

00:15:04.147 --> 00:15:05.281
And someone here…

00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:08.032
talks too much.

00:15:11.052 --> 00:15:12.242
Just remember.

00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:15.635
That I’ve already been patient with you.

00:15:46.585 --> 00:15:47.776
If you really want me to help.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:50.694
Then you better remember…

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.914
what I do to your body.

00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:06.139
That hurts.

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:34.991
Does this even help you?

00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:39.716
Can you help me more than that?

00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:48.449
Don’t underestimate me.

00:16:50.735 --> 00:16:52.093
Then show me.

00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:12.961
Are you sure…

00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:13.904
you want this?

00:17:15.415 --> 00:17:16.829
Is this really the time to ask?

00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:21.282
Keep that mouth for moaning, Babe.

00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:05.063
(If you really want me to help.)

00:19:05.973 --> 00:19:07.097
(Then you better remember…)

00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:09.468
(what I do to your body.)

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:11.679
Good that you came, King.

00:20:12.522 --> 00:20:14.297
I have something I want to talk to you about.

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:34.699
I’ll be right back.

00:21:04.808 --> 00:21:05.774
Why aren’t you dressed properly?

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.864
Queen.

00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:13.235
What happened last night?

00:21:16.146 --> 00:21:17.067
You don’t remember?

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.461
Is there anything I should remember?

00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:37.675
Should I remind you what happened?

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:53.321
No.

00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:56.665
I remember everything just fine.

00:22:01.304 --> 00:22:02.428
Thank you for helping me.

00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:05.294
Help?

00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:07.620
Yes.

00:22:08.935 --> 00:22:10.778
I was the one who asked...

00:22:12.048 --> 00:22:12.745
for your help last night.

00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:17.543
But you don’t have to take responsibility for me.

00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:20.094
We’re nothing to each other.

00:22:25.454 --> 00:22:26.348
Are you mad?

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:47.811
Once you’ve crossed the finish line.

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:52.002
The victory is yours.

00:22:56.364 --> 00:22:58.364
But if you refuse to accept it.

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:05.204
Then you’ve given it up to someone else.

00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:11.121
What do you mean?

00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:13.493
I don’t understand.

00:23:17.639 --> 00:23:18.852
I don’t have time to talk to you.

00:23:21.139 --> 00:23:21.926
About last night…

00:23:25.429 --> 00:23:27.429
Can we act like it never happened?

00:23:40.923 --> 00:23:42.923
If I actually became interested in you.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.294
What would you do?

00:23:56.484 --> 00:23:57.248
That’s impossible.

00:23:58.945 --> 00:23:59.754
How could someone like you…

00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:02.058
be interested in someone like me?

00:24:13.522 --> 00:24:16.308
If you want me to act like nothing happened last night.

00:24:21.106 --> 00:24:22.140
I’ll do it.

00:24:57.725 --> 00:24:59.568
Is there anything you want to tell me, Queen?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:21.877
Thank you so much, Kongtup.

00:25:21.877 --> 00:25:23.043
Please come again.

00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:28.965
Kongtup.

00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:41.732
Still got quite a punch…

00:25:42.757 --> 00:25:43.296
King.

00:25:45.623 --> 00:25:47.376
Do I have to do this?

00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:49.927
Before you finally stop bothering Queen.

00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:52.858
Did she tell on me?

00:26:09.227 --> 00:26:10.912
No Queen but there’s still King.

00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:12.947
So that’s how it is.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.320
I’ve always been like this.

00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:21.890
You should’ve known that.

00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:26.833
Someone like you will never change.

00:26:27.766 --> 00:26:29.227
Once rotten, always rotten.

00:26:33.837 --> 00:26:35.428
And do you think someone like you…

00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:36.816
is any better?

00:27:05.681 --> 00:27:07.052
So they’re collecting again.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.492
(Bonita is now living with a socialite.)
(Named “Queen Keerapat.”)

00:27:12.492 --> 00:27:13.099
Who is that?

00:27:15.576 --> 00:27:17.733
So did Bo really end up with someone rich…?

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:21.482
Queen.

00:30:26.054 --> 00:30:27.512
About us…

00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:30.960
If we started from 1…

00:30:32.924 --> 00:30:34.201
How far do you think we’d go?

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:49.014
When you cried…

00:30:50.824 --> 00:30:52.517
I just sat quietly behind you.

00:30:53.187 --> 00:30:53.973
Do you remember?

00:31:00.199 --> 00:31:00.908
Yes.

00:31:04.551 --> 00:31:06.060
But if you cry again…

00:31:08.154 --> 00:31:09.586
I won’t do that anymore.

00:31:18.907 --> 00:31:20.468
But I’ll hold you instead.

00:31:34.697 --> 00:31:37.007
Our story’s gone far past 1, Babe.

00:31:45.576 --> 00:31:47.576
What do you really feel about me?

00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:55.632
For someone who only trusts me 10%...

00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:57.607
Do you think you have the right to ask that?

00:32:02.828 --> 00:32:04.724
Even if I didn’t trust you at all…

00:32:07.128 --> 00:32:09.877
I’d still want to be the only one who can ask you anything.

00:32:41.378 --> 00:32:43.636
I’ll pick you up after class.

00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:46.955
Call me if anything comes up.

00:32:50.102 --> 00:32:50.733
Alright.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.090
I’m going now.

00:32:53.228 --> 00:32:54.221
See you later, Sam.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.655
See you later.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:56.985
Have fun in class!

00:32:57.761 --> 00:32:58.522
Of course!

00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:19.991
Yes, King?

00:33:20.406 --> 00:33:20.986
(Queen.)

00:33:21.426 --> 00:33:23.503
(Can you come by for dinner tonight?)

00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:25.918
(Mom wants to talk to you.)

00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:37.457
Alright.

00:33:38.827 --> 00:33:40.827
I have something to talk to her too.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.096
Hold on.

00:33:47.337 --> 00:33:47.839
Yes?

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.510
Here she is!

00:33:57.806 --> 00:33:58.618
Let’s see her face!

00:33:58.618 --> 00:33:59.643
You ungrateful daughter!

00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:00.791
You worthless child!

00:34:01.474 --> 00:34:02.336
This is her!

00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:03.605
The ungrateful daughter!

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:06.624
What are you doing, mom?!

00:34:07.195 --> 00:34:08.110
Exposing you!

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.913
So you’re living the good life and forgot about me?!

00:34:10.913 --> 00:34:11.932
I’m your mother!

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.263
Where’s that person who’s taking you?!

00:34:14.263 --> 00:34:15.786
Didn’t they say they’re so rich?

00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:17.834
If they’re that rich, take me to them then!

00:34:18.066 --> 00:34:19.421
I’ll make them pay a high dowry!

00:34:19.421 --> 00:34:20.276
You hear me, Bo?!

00:34:20.276 --> 00:34:21.311
Please, stop, mom.

00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:21.954
Stop what?!

00:34:21.954 --> 00:34:22.525
Please, mom.

00:34:22.525 --> 00:34:23.407
Let go, Bo!

00:34:23.407 --> 00:34:24.193
Please stop, mom!

00:34:24.736 --> 00:34:25.367
Bo!

00:34:25.498 --> 00:34:26.104
Mom!

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.563
You broke my phone!

00:34:30.997 --> 00:34:31.602
Bo!

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:32.211
Please, mom!

00:34:35.567 --> 00:34:36.136
Bo!

00:34:36.329 --> 00:34:37.336
What have you done?!

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.575
What are you look at?!

00:34:38.938 --> 00:34:39.879
Never seen this before?!

00:34:40.423 --> 00:34:42.500
Never seen an ungrateful daughter like this before?!

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:44.586
Please stop, mom.

00:34:44.586 --> 00:34:45.805
You’re embarrassing me.

00:34:45.908 --> 00:34:46.970
Your embarrased?!

00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:48.304
What are you embarrassed for?!

00:34:49.894 --> 00:34:52.075
You betrayed your parents and you’re not ashamed?!

00:34:52.774 --> 00:34:54.774
Aren’t you ashamed of being an ungrateful daughter?!

00:34:54.982 --> 00:34:56.130
But now you’re embarrased?!

00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:00.499
You worthless child!

00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:02.707
I curse you!

00:35:03.742 --> 00:35:04.816
May you hit rock bottom.

00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:07.336
May your life sink into ruin.

00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:08.273
May you never prosper.

00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:09.031
You hear me?!

00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:11.096
Look at this!

00:35:11.821 --> 00:35:13.201
This is the face of an ungrateful daughter!

00:35:13.201 --> 00:35:13.843
You see this?!

00:35:13.972 --> 00:35:15.367
Got a good life and forgot about me.

00:35:15.818 --> 00:35:18.376
I’m your mother! You have to repay me!

00:35:18.646 --> 00:35:19.376
Am I right?!

00:35:19.511 --> 00:35:20.297
Go ahead, record this!

00:35:20.297 --> 00:35:21.627
Get up and take me to them!

00:35:22.228 --> 00:35:22.808
Stop acting pathetic!

00:35:22.808 --> 00:35:23.403
Please, let go of me!

00:35:23.403 --> 00:35:23.925
No!

00:35:23.925 --> 00:35:24.813
Please!

00:35:24.813 --> 00:35:25.918
Take me to them now!

00:35:26.993 --> 00:35:28.115
I’m begging you, mom!

00:35:30.066 --> 00:35:31.214
Please take your hands off her.

00:35:36.716 --> 00:35:37.786
Queen.

00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:53.808
So it’s you.

00:35:53.808 --> 00:35:55.271
The rich one who’s taking my daughter.

00:35:55.271 --> 00:35:56.278
Good that you’re here.

00:35:58.212 --> 00:35:59.176
I’m her mother.

00:35:59.749 --> 00:36:00.613
If you’re going to take care of her.

00:36:00.613 --> 00:36:01.859
You’ll have to take care of me too.

00:36:05.861 --> 00:36:09.385
Do you have any idea how much I’ve spent raising her?!

00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:21.056
If it’s money you want.

00:36:21.988 --> 00:36:23.704
Then please name your price.

00:36:28.318 --> 00:36:29.337
How could I put a number on that?!

00:36:30.294 --> 00:36:31.726
You think I can put that into money?!

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.004
She’s a human!

00:36:40.708 --> 00:36:41.804
I’ll pay you 1 million.

00:36:46.532 --> 00:36:47.964
And you’ll have to stay away from Bonita.

00:36:50.577 --> 00:36:51.183
Queen!

00:37:00.645 --> 00:37:01.560
Will you take it?

00:37:02.879 --> 00:37:03.614
Of course, I will.

00:37:06.508 --> 00:37:07.010
Sam.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.080
Yes.

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:18.821
What?!

00:37:22.826 --> 00:37:23.767
May I have your bank account number?

00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:25.924
You didn’t have to come at me like that.

00:37:43.578 --> 00:37:44.132
1 million…

00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:51.281
1 million…

00:37:57.336 --> 00:37:57.954
Sam.

00:37:57.954 --> 00:37:58.479
Mom…

00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:01.032
Handle the press and shut everything down.

00:38:01.731 --> 00:38:02.231
Right away.

00:38:13.252 --> 00:38:14.838
I’m having dinner with my mom this evening.

00:38:17.036 --> 00:38:18.029
You’re coming with me.

00:38:22.336 --> 00:38:24.070
You just paid 1 million…

00:38:26.474 --> 00:38:27.336
I have to…

00:38:27.336 --> 00:38:28.417
You don’t have to do anything.

00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:09.565
(You worthless child!)

00:39:10.206 --> 00:39:11.431
I curse you!

00:39:11.431 --> 00:39:12.586
May you hit rock bottom.

00:39:12.586 --> 00:39:14.556
May your life sink into ruin.

00:39:14.556 --> 00:39:15.548
May you never prosper.

00:39:15.548 --> 00:39:16.291
You hear me?!

00:39:26.065 --> 00:39:28.401
Will I ever get away from all this?

00:39:30.727 --> 00:39:32.056
How far do I have to run?

00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:42.856
When you’re with me…

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:45.710
You don’t have to run anywhere.

00:39:52.555 --> 00:39:53.186
Let’s go.

00:40:26.965 --> 00:40:27.700
Good afternoon.

00:40:31.885 --> 00:40:32.775
Good afternoon, King.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.518
Good afternoon, Bo.

00:40:37.954 --> 00:40:38.895
What happened to your face?

00:40:42.228 --> 00:40:43.273
My mom did it.

00:40:50.889 --> 00:40:52.605
Come upstairs to my office.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.336
Wait for me here.

00:40:58.404 --> 00:40:59.087
I’ll be right back.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.336
Please look after her, King.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.297
Please, take a seat.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:14.576
Yes.

00:42:18.566 --> 00:42:19.869
I had someone look into it.

00:42:24.467 --> 00:42:25.202
I know.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.765
I can’t accept this.

00:42:27.464 --> 00:42:29.903
That girl is not suitable for you in any way.

00:42:30.938 --> 00:42:32.336
In what way is she not suitable?

00:42:32.336 --> 00:42:33.147
Every way.

00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:35.768
Her status, education, and social standing.

00:42:36.467 --> 00:42:37.951
Everything you said.

00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:40.210
I already have all of that, Mom.

00:42:41.013 --> 00:42:43.013
You can expect those things from me.

00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:45.480
But not from the people around me.

00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:46.212
Queen.

00:42:48.342 --> 00:42:50.342
I can accept that you like women.

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:53.015
But can’t you at least let me choose who’s best for you?

00:42:53.015 --> 00:42:54.697
Why can’t you give me this one thing?

00:42:54.911 --> 00:42:57.014
I have the right to choose everything for myself, Mom.

00:42:59.885 --> 00:43:01.187
Whether it’s suitable or not…

00:43:02.016 --> 00:43:03.293
I’m the only one who gets to decide that.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.976
Please, excuse me.

00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:05.942
Queen.

00:43:06.075 --> 00:43:06.575
Queen.

00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:07.234
Queen!

00:43:07.234 --> 00:43:08.119
Come back here now!

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:11.755
Come back here now, Queen!

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:12.977
Come talk to me right now.

00:43:12.977 --> 00:43:13.855
Stop right there!

00:43:14.062 --> 00:43:14.960
Why, Mom?

00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:19.570
If being “suitable” is everything…

00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:23.764
Then why did I have to grow up in a broken family?

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.336
Why did Wasin choose you?

00:43:28.387 --> 00:43:30.129
When you had already been married.

00:43:30.518 --> 00:43:32.518
And already had me and King.

00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:36.136
Is that what you call “suitable,” Mom?

00:43:36.136 --> 00:43:36.791
Queen!

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:42.477
Are you happy now?

00:43:43.951 --> 00:43:45.305
For making me and Queen fight like this?

00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:48.392
I’m sorry.

00:43:50.714 --> 00:43:51.397
What are you apologizing for?

00:43:52.664 --> 00:43:54.302
Because I made you and your mom fight.

00:43:54.692 --> 00:43:55.530
Good that you know.

00:43:59.259 --> 00:44:00.743
You did nothing wrong.

00:44:59.506 --> 00:45:01.506
I don’t want you to fight with your mom.

00:45:05.797 --> 00:45:06.553
It’s my life.

00:45:07.194 --> 00:45:07.839
It’s me.

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:09.524
I have the right to choose.

00:45:11.105 --> 00:45:12.441
Whoever I choose is up to me.

00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:19.064
Can you not talk like you’re going to choose me?

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.287
If my mom were to give you money…

00:45:41.283 --> 00:45:42.758
To make you leave my life…

00:45:43.177 --> 00:45:44.043
What would you do?

00:45:59.786 --> 00:46:00.984
What do you think…

00:46:02.123 --> 00:46:03.100
I should do?

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:08.561
When an elder gives you something…

00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:10.345
You should take it.

00:46:16.627 --> 00:46:17.383
Then…

00:46:19.627 --> 00:46:21.627
Do you want me to leave your life?

00:46:28.001 --> 00:46:29.061
You should ask yourself that.

00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:32.172
If you want to stay…

00:46:34.168 --> 00:46:34.868
or leave.

00:46:59.132 --> 00:47:00.192
What if I really leave?

00:47:08.714 --> 00:47:09.995
That’s your choice.

00:47:24.855 --> 00:47:26.192
Have you ever surrendered to anyone?

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.031
Why would I?

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.590
You’ve always been a queen…

00:47:49.732 --> 00:47:51.870
Don’t you ever want to step down from your throne…

00:47:55.885 --> 00:47:57.194
To surrender to someone?

00:48:05.865 --> 00:48:07.865
Do you really want to be above me that much?

00:48:17.179 --> 00:48:19.179
If I’m above you…

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
And you have to look up at me…

00:48:39.015 --> 00:48:39.909
What are you about to do?

00:48:44.685 --> 00:48:45.772
Want to take a shower together?

00:49:04.325 --> 00:49:05.219
I’m kidding.

00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:07.224
I can shower by myself.

00:50:43.348 --> 00:50:44.325
Tonight…

00:50:46.487 --> 00:50:48.625
I won’t allow you to have any bad dreams…

00:50:58.148 --> 00:51:00.203
Because I can’t be there to take care of you.

00:51:45.246 --> 00:51:46.112
Keep it down!

00:51:49.433 --> 00:51:50.244
So, what’s your call?

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:53.464
I cleaned them all out!

00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:02.684
Pay me now.

00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:04.490
That’s 2,500.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.466
And another 5,000.

00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:10.224
Bua.

00:52:10.505 --> 00:52:11.622
Don’t touch me!

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.238
My luck’s turning!

00:52:17.257 --> 00:52:18.844
You’re going all in tonight, Bua.

00:52:19.621 --> 00:52:20.460
Of course!

00:52:21.377 --> 00:52:23.211
I’m a millionaire now!

00:52:23.885 --> 00:52:26.404
At least Bo is finally useful for something.

00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:28.203
I’m getting rich!

00:52:29.415 --> 00:52:30.558
Keep it going!

00:52:31.163 --> 00:52:32.804
I’m betting 5,000 this round.

00:52:36.155 --> 00:52:38.155
Bua really has a million?

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:50.430
Kem!

00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:51.772
What are you doing?!

00:52:59.272 --> 00:53:00.083
Let go of me!

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:11.591
Pay up already!

00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:35.418
Think you’re tough, huh?!

00:53:36.503 --> 00:53:37.756
You think you’re that tough?!

00:53:43.202 --> 00:53:43.985
That’s enough.

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:48.244
Get up!

00:53:51.743 --> 00:53:52.526
Look at you…

00:53:52.526 --> 00:53:53.445
what a mess.

00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:55.499
You look just like...

00:53:56.555 --> 00:53:57.644
A stray dog.

00:53:57.864 --> 00:53:59.366
Better than a sneaky dog like you!

00:54:05.234 --> 00:54:06.124
You little mutt.

00:54:06.935 --> 00:54:07.912
You’re just a small fry.

00:54:08.498 --> 00:54:10.305
But you sure bark loud.

00:54:11.473 --> 00:54:12.444
You’re just another dog!

00:54:15.766 --> 00:54:17.351
You just don’t know when to quit, do you?

00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:19.854
Always bringing trouble on yourself.

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:23.574
Stupid enough to let that gold-digging girl fool you.

00:54:26.842 --> 00:54:27.459
Let’s go!

00:54:40.737 --> 00:54:41.631
I’ve told you before…

00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:44.106
Don’t ever talk about Bo like this again!

00:54:47.456 --> 00:54:48.156
Kem…

00:56:51.573 --> 00:56:52.384
Good morning.

00:56:56.467 --> 00:56:57.250
I dreamed…

00:56:57.919 --> 00:56:58.785
A snake was wrapping around me.

00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:04.496
There’s a saying…

00:57:06.519 --> 00:57:07.689
If you dream about a snake…

00:57:09.934 --> 00:57:11.298
It means you’ll meet your soulmate.

00:57:55.764 --> 00:57:56.851
What are you doing?

00:58:01.944 --> 00:58:02.893
Have you found one?

00:58:08.097 --> 00:58:09.240
Your soulmate.

00:59:03.052 --> 00:59:03.642
Here you go.

00:59:21.192 --> 00:59:22.418
I have a meeting today.

00:59:23.722 --> 00:59:24.782
Do you have class?

00:59:25.782 --> 00:59:26.399
Yes.

00:59:38.983 --> 00:59:40.292
Then wait for me at the university.

00:59:41.652 --> 00:59:42.491
I’ll pick you up.

00:59:45.778 --> 00:59:46.368
Alright.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.522
(Shot dead over business dispute.)

01:00:15.288 --> 01:00:18.532
(Police suspect a link to the underground trade.)

01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:23.898
This is…

01:00:28.651 --> 01:00:29.324
Queen…

01:00:38.305 --> 01:00:39.558
Good morning, Kirin.

01:00:41.951 --> 01:00:43.951
Queen just left for work.

01:00:46.428 --> 01:00:47.239
I’m not here for Queen.

01:00:50.369 --> 01:00:51.180
I’m here for you.

01:01:07.946 --> 01:01:10.471
You told me you wouldn’t make me feel scared.

01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:16.311
If you do as I ask…

01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:18.044
I will go into politics.

01:01:18.547 --> 01:01:19.883
Just like you wanted.

01:01:20.685 --> 01:01:22.574
If you truly care about Queen…

01:01:22.685 --> 01:01:23.880
you should know…

01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:25.437
what you have to do.

01:01:25.884 --> 01:01:26.834
Bo…

01:01:27.324 --> 01:01:28.716
You really came back.

01:01:28.962 --> 01:01:30.990
As Queen’s favorite…

01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:34.643
You can stand beside me without fear.
