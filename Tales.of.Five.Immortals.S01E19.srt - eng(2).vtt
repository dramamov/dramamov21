00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.319
I need to save them.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.159
Miss, please accept my condolences.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.439
Old Ge.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.439
Go make some food.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.760
Your mistress has been busy with funeral arrangements these days.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.120
Okay.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.319
And hasn't rested much.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.400
Yes.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.680
It looks like rain.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.599
No.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.560
I must hurry to the cemetery.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.879
Or Grandpa and the others will get wet.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.640
What's most important for you now

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.439
is to rest.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.280
You need to learn to let go.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.760
Move forward.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.439
Move forward.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.039
Grandpa and Laifu are both gone.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.919
Where should I go?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.120
Don't you want to find the killer

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.039
and avenge Laifu and Bai Ye?

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.400
How can I take revenge alone?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.080
I can't even find their bodies.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.879
Can only bury their clothes.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.439
Officer Gu.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.159
When will this case be solved?

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.560
I'll help you.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.719
Catching criminals is my duty.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.039
I'll come back at this time tomorrow.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.879
Hope to see you in better spirits.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.599
Together,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360
we'll give them justice.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.439
Wait.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.400
No need to wait until tomorrow.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.439
Let's start now.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.719
Take it over.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.400
Hui Xin.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.039
Tell me again,

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.120
what your boyfriend Zhang Hua

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.199
used to do for work.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.400
He worked at the police station.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.479
Handled household registration.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.520
Did he interact with many people?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.960
Not many.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.000
He just managed files,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
stayed in his office all day,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
avoiding people.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.439
Do you

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.120
have any new leads?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.919
We all think

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.240
he impersonated Zhang Hua

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.560
for some special reason.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.360
I...

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.159
We two

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.439
are from ordinary families.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.080
He just had a basic salary,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.399
dealt with files all day,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.399
and had few friends.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.079
Another dead end.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.160
Hui Xin.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.560
If there are new leads,

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.000
I'll contact you again.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:31.639
Also,

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.759
the fake Zhang Hua has escaped.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.399
During this time,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.279
police will protect you.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.399
Be careful yourself.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.639
Old Wang.

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.360
Her safety is your responsibility.

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.920
Yes.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.879
Come.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.040
How about

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.480
we check Zhang Hua's office?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.439
Rarely

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.319
do we think alike.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.279
This is Zhang Hua's office.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.319
This is where Zhang Hua

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.680
processed all household records.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.920
Before Zhang Hua disappeared,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.839
was there anything unusual?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.959
His daily work

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.480
was mostly alone here.

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.639
We're not sure either.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.360
Did you see it too?

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.959
What's drawn here?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.560
And here.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.040
Director.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.959
Next to these names,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.519
why these marks?

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:38.879
We didn't make these.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.399
What's special about this family?

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.040
Why would Zhang Hua look for them?

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.199
Whatever's special about them,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.160
this person

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.000
is planning something big.

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.800
What should we do next?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.639
Start with the missing persons,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.720
investigate one by one.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.160
Our daughter's been missing half a year.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480
Found nothing.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.480
What's the use of you coming here?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.959
We're here this time

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.879
because we've found some new clues

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.680
So we'd like to ask you both

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.000
if you've missed any details

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.560
that could help our investigation

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.720
Nothing special

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.439
That day I came back from the fields

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.600
and my wife told me

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.399
our daughter was missing

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.439
I was cooking that day

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.519
She said she was going out briefly

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.519
and never came back

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.480
I've asked everyone around here

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.279
and reported to the police

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:57.319
Now we can only pray she's safe

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.759
That day

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.839
did your daughter act strangely?

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:05.720
No

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.720
Both of you

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.319
If that's the case

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.000
it's hard for us to help you

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.040
This was my grandfather's keepsake

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.680
I couldn't save him that day

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.680
Now I just want to catch the killer

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.759
Xiaohua's case and my grandfather's case

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.320
are the same

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.159
So her clues are

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:44.120
really extremely important to me

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.360
Uncle, I beg you

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.799
Please tell me, okay?

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm begging you

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.120
I'm begging you

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.679
Please tell me

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.960
No one believed me before

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.559
I believe you

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.519
That day was like any other

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720
I came back from the fields at dusk

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.840
and felt something was wrong

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.639
After dinner at home

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.320
suddenly a strong wind rose outside

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.320
This road is usually crowded

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.240
But that day

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.840
there wasn't a soul

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.039
How strange

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.080
The street's empty today

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.159
Not a single person

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.399
Maybe everyone went home early

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.200
Good thing I came back early

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.960
or you'd keep worrying about me

00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:58.039
Be good now

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.840
Mom, I've washed up

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.480
Okay

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:28.159
Strange

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:29.200
Who's there so late?

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:30.799
You said no one was outside

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.240
Here they come

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.080
There's really no one outside

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.480
Go open the door

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.080
Who is it?

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:50.720
It's not raining outside

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.360
Why is it all wet?

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.799
Thirsty

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.759
Alright, come in

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:57.919
I'll get you some water

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:09.759
Thirsty

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.519
Here, brother

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.559
Thirsty

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.919
Still thirsty

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.519
Thirsty

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:45.200
Sorry, brother

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.799
We're out of water

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.039
It's dark now

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.440
not convenient to fetch more

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.879
Maybe try another house

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.519
Thirsty

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.799
Dad, Mom

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.440
What's wrong with you?

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.480
When we woke up

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.840
our daughter was gone

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:10.360
Did you tell the police?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.200
We did

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
No one believed us

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:16.279
Told us not to be superstitious

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:17.440
Even suspected

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:20.000
we killed our own daughter

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.679
and made up this story

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.000
They investigated for long

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.279
but found nothing

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.639
so it was dropped

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.639
Don't worry

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:38.000
I'll definitely find Xiaohua for you

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.080
Do you have a photo of Xiaohua?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.759
No

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.000
Oh right

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.200
This is her zodiac year

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:52.879
We tied a red string on her wrist

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.679
Red string

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.200
Officer Gu

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.399
I was just near Fang Xiaohua's house

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.279
and found a small pier

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.399
Think about it

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.600
Late at night

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:14.000
He was all alone, soaking wet

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.159
carrying a girl in his arms

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:16.879
He must have wanted to escape

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.399
somewhere no one would see him

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.519
This pier must be crucial

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.279
Miss Bai

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.679
I let you join the investigation before

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.720
to help you overcome your grief

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.360
But now

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:34.240
I realize I might have been wrong

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.600
This case is extremely dangerous

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.120
You can't be involved anymore

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.879
Leave the rest

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.879
to me

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.759
Why?

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:48.919
Avenging Grandpa and Laifu

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
is my responsibility too

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.279
I've made my decision

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.200
All future operations will be kept from you

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.080
until we catch the real culprit

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.960
Xiao Li

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:02.240
Here

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:04.120
Gather all officers immediately

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.159
Full gear, let's move out

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.159
Sorry, Officer Gu

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:08.320
There's an order saying

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.679
you can't investigate this case

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.679
Who said that?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.120
I did

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.480
Chief

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.840
A cop must use their own judgment

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:30.200
Can't just follow others blindly

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.840
You should take some rest

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.080
Leave other matters alone

00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:42.240
This is my judgment

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:47.480
Gu Mingli

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.840
During your investigation

00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:52.679
you abused power and leaked secrets

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.200
You're suspended effective now

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.480
Until this matter is fully investigated

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.960
you're not to leave this place
