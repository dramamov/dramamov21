00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.400
Did Young Master Sun drug you

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.830
to get revenge

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.230
for what you did at Qinxi Valley?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.640
Not really.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.150
He was also trying to please Jin.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.910
What?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.000
You don't think family members

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.310
would hurt their own?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.000
I don't know about other families.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.240
But in this family,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.560
nothing like that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400
would ever happen.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.310
I wouldn't allow anyone

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.310
to do anything like that.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.550
After all,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.030
family members

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.030
should be honest.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.430
Now,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.240
we are a family.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.430
Right?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.870
Of course.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.910
I even told you

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.280
my sister and I don't get along,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.360
which is our dirty laundry.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.560
What else would I keep from you?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.990
Is that so?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.630
I'll remember what you said.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.520
And I hope you will

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.400
keep your word.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.590
Is my house really this far?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.680
It's taking so long.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.960
Are you teasing me by taking me

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.430
on a detour?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.750
If you want to get down and walk,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.590
I won't stop you.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.640
Linyang.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.430
My sisters caused some trouble.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.190
Sorry for that.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.800
Yu said she didn't feel well.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.950
As her big brother,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.430
I was really worried.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.720
And I happened to know

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.430
Miss Song has medical skills.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.070
So, I asked her

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
to check on Yu.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.400
Tuantuan.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.830
Earlier, I was drugged by mistake.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.000
Right now, I feel weak all over.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.190
I don't know

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.040
when the effect will wear off.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.710
Check on me.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Can you do something

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.920
to help me recover faster?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.720
Ladies in my family

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.560
carry some medicine

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.270
for protection

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.950
when they're away from home.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.430
Yu, you must have brought

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.640
the wrong medicine

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.390
and then misused it, right?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.200
Right.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.430
The drug bottle looks almost

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.000
the same as the others.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.160
I took the wrong one in a hurry.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.430
Ms. Chu Yu,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.310
that was careless of you.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.630
Even the most careful person

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.720
can slip up sometimes.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.040
Am I right, Yun?

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.950
Ms. Chu worked tirelessly

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for this banquet.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.310
It's understandable

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.240
that she was careless.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.960
Young Marquis,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.310
you have a pretty scenic garden.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.120
We didn't enjoy the scenery earlier.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.560
If the two of us stay here,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.480
Miss Song may be distracted.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.870
Why don't you

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.870
show me around for a moment?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.030
Alright.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.950
It's pretty strange.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.390
I think it's the first time

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.000
you've been visiting us.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800
Are you actually

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.630
not happy

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.560
with Ms. Chu's life?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.310
My sister is a woman

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.560
of her words.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.310
As her big brother,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.230
I will always support her,

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.640
not embarrass her.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.230
Is that so?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.040
General Chu,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.040
you knew Ms. Chu Jin

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.240
held a grudge against Chu Yu

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.270
but you still brought her here.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.630
I used to think

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.270
you didn't care

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.270
about Chu Yu at all.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.000
Young Marquis,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.270
what happened today

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.800
was indeed my oversight.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.680
But it happened at your place, anyway.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.430
What role

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.190
did you play in all this?

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.830
Today, I helped Chu Yu out of trouble.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.560
Not you.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.800
If you hadn't stalled me,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.680
Young Master Sun
wouldn't have succeeded.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.430
Do you not want to answer?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.630
Or do you not know how to answer?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.720
Alright, Ms. Chu Yu.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.000
Get up and see how you feel.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.430
I do feel much better.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.680
Tuantuan, you have
remarkable medical skills.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.390
Actually,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.800
you flatter me.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.950
When you performed acupuncture on me,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.270
you were even more focused.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.630
You must take practicing medicine

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.600
pretty seriously.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.750
So, your medical skills

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.680
must be even better

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.520
than I said they are.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.950
Thank you for the praise.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.910
As her big brother,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.390
I shouldn't have been negligent, but...

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.040
General Chu and Young Marquis.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.680
I've neutralized

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.750
the drug in Ms. Chu Yu.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.750
Thank you, Miss Song.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.360
I really appreciate it.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.320
But may I ask

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.630
if there will be

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.470
lingering effects?

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.720
No, actually.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.070
But if Ms. Chu Yu

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.160
can have a bowl of milk

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.480
before she goes to bed,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.560
that would be great.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.630
I'll go prepare it.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.750
Very well.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.750
It's rather late.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.510
I'll escort Miss Song

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.720
to her own home.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.320
Young Marquis,

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.750
let's talk another day.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.840
My Lady.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.510
Young Marquis suddenly

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.750
sent over a bowl of milk.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.750
He said it was Miss Song's advice

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200
and you could drink it

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.040
before going to bed.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.030
Xiaoqi.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.270
You almost pounced on the milk.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.110
Xiaoqi,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.840
the milk isn't for you.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.230
But anyway,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.150
when Wei Yun sent me back,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.320
he asked me if I was hiding something.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.270
I lost my mind

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.360
and almost let it slip.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.550
Xiaoqi stopped me.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.870
It really helped a lot.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.110
Am I right, Xiaoqi?

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.670
Feed it the milk.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.630
Alright.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.480
Xiaoqi deserves a reward.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.230
Come on, Xiaoqi.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
There you go.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.590
My Lady,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.390
didn't you say

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.510
Young Marquis Wei

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.510
covered for you

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.550
at Fragrance House?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.390
In that case,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.480
I don't think

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.790
he's as hostile as before.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.670
If we can persuade him

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.870
to help you investigate

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.870
the crossbow case,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.360
we'll get more done in less time.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.790
Will he give me

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.000
the Fish-shaped Tally

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.150
just because I ask for it?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.270
By investigating the Arsenal Bureau,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.320
I'm deceiving His Majesty.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
He isn't a silly man.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.200
How could he easily help me?

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.030
If I tell him about this,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.960
I may get him

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.870
to suspect me instead.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.440
Do you remember

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.600
I asked you to stalk Wei Yun

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.840
for the location of the Arsenal Bureau?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.440
Of course.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.960
Don't mention it.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.080
I was pretty angry.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.790
I searched that mountain for so long,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.960
only to find nothing.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.270
That mountain

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.910
has always been mist-shrouded.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.080
And the Arsenal Bureau is in the forest.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.110
It's a tough job.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.960
But lately, my brother

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.910
has been searching.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.390
Finally, his hard work paid off.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.870
He has found the specific location

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.960
of the Arsenal Bureau.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.800
So,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.600
everything is ready.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.360
All we need is the Fish-shaped Tally.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.110
Is that right?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.390
We only need the tally.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.700
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
General Chu,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.960
you don't need to do this.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.000
I can do such small things

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.440
like getting on or off the carriage.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680
Miss Song,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.960
do I have something

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.120
on my face?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.040
General Chu,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.510
let me be your physician.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.200
I do have

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.960
some old injuries.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.750
But they don't bother me.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.750
You don't need

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.790
to trouble yourself.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.510
You're home.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.750
I'll take my leave.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.550
The dark circles under your eyes

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.030
indicate depression,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.320
insomnia, and frequent dreams.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.910
Your pale lips

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.270
indicate a deficient spleen

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.600
and poor blood circulation.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.030
What's more...

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.440
When I saw you

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.480
walk along,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.630
you were unsteady

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.550
and short of breath.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.080
All this indicates

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.460
that your injuries

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.580
have recovered

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.910
only superficially.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.590
They might have

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.870
caused internal damage.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.470
What do you think?

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.510
I described all this

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.600
before feeling your pulse.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.870
So, General Chu,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.720
am I qualified

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.000
to give you a treatment?

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.790
Are you doing this

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.150
to repay my sister for dealing

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.870
with the Crown Prince?

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.790
Not at all.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.480
I just think your case

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.910
is quite a challenge

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.080
for me right now.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.510
I want to improve my skills

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.910
by treating you.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.800
In that case,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.480
I'll leave my health

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.320
in your hands.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.510
It's too late now.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.600
If you still linger,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.360
your father will be worried.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.630
Alright.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.670
I'll go and see you soon.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.560
General Chu.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.840
Rest assured. I will cure you.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:46.630
General,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.480
do you really need Miss Song

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.560
as your physician?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.910
Physician Li's treatment

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.910
has lasted six months.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.080
You'll recover soon.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.670
Miss Song's father

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.150
has been spoiling her.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.240
Yet, she remains innocent.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.510
Just like my two sisters.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.480
When she was obsessed with medication,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.840
she was eager for patients.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.630
Many rich people mocked her.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.790
Today, she helped Yu.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.510
I'll let her do what she wants.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.870
What harm can it do?

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.390
Why do you look at me?

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.600
Are you rebelling?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.960
You're the father

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.040
while I am the son.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.550
I have to obey you, anyway.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.120
Now you can talk back, huh?

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.080
You're disturbing me.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.080
The other day, I told you

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.720
to stay away from the Wei family.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.320
But what did you do?

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.720
You defied me even more,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.560
right?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.600
Attending the banquet

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.440
was one thing.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.200
Taking your siblings

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.790
was quite another.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.270
Why didn't you

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.600
even take your father there?

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.910
I had planned to.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.000
But I thought you were too busy.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.440
And you, Song Shilan.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.600
Did you advise him

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.960
to prepare Taishan Stone?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.560
Father,

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.790
I attended the banquet...

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.510
Father,

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.270
I dragged Shilan there.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.390
And how could he come up

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.910
with that brilliant idea?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.870
You sound quite proud, huh?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.560
No, no, no.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.680
No.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.710
No, I don't.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.120
I'm warning you.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.240
His Majesty is wary

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.840
of close contact
between military families.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.320
At court,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.750
I pleaded for Wei Yun.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.030
It would easily

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.510
make His Majesty suspicious.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.360
You even visited Wei Yun

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360
so blatantly.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.270
Don't you know people will gossip?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.480
They just will.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.200
Do you understand?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.390
Do you?

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.230
You.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:34.750
And you.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.990
Tuantuan.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.750
You still remember you're engaged

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.000
to the Crown Prince, don't you?

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.150
Today, General Chu

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.320
escorted you home.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.480
If this reaches

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.390
the ears of the Crown Prince,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.200
how do you think he will feel?

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.320
I don't care how he feels.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.630
I don't like him.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.270
I have no choice

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.870
but to marry him.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.840
But his secret concubines

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.390
tarnished my reputation

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.480
and hurt my feelings.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.560
I know.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.000
A man often has concubines.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400
So, I've swallowed

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.240
my dissatisfaction

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.480
with the Crown Prince.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.680
But Father,

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.110
I serve as a physician

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.350
for General Chu.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.840
What have I done wrong?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.320
Tuantuan,

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.270
I know you feel aggrieved.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.550
But you and he came back alone

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.270
so late at night.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.030
People will easily gossip.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.350
How about this?

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.720
I'll get some imperial physicians

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.720
to treat General Chu

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.640
with you.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.670
What do you say?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.800
Father,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.160
the Crown Prince merely apologized

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.000
for having secret concubines.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.750
But because I will treat General Chu,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.070
you're trying so hard

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.270
to make me submit.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.680
How could you be so unfair

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.200
just because you're also a man?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.870
- Tuantuan.
- Tuantuan.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.040
Tuantuan.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.760
Father,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.440
Tuantuan has a point.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.720
She's my only daughter.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.270
I certainly want her to be happy.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.240
The Crown Prince has secret concubines.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.240
He's just a philanderer.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.550
But Tuantuan doesn't like this.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.000
So, we should reconsider

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.000
her engagement.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.880
Think of the Crown Prince.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.640
If Tuantuan has to marry him,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.790
I'll object first.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.920
Let people say whatever they want.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.270
Everybody gossips.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.160
We can't control them.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960
What about I promise you

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.680
Wei Yun and I

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.350
will only meet in secret?

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.430
Shut up.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.510
How is your copying?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.510
Father, I'm done.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.070
I punished you

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.350
to make you learn your lesson

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.750
and always remember

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.590
what I say to you.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.200
If you make a mistake again,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.350
the punishment will be worse.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.630
I get it, Father.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.350
Jin.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.000
Jin, are you all right?

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.000
Mother.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.430
Linyang,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.310
Jin has been kneeling in there

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.480
(Chu's Ancestral Hall)
all night.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.110
Even if she made a terrible mistake,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.510
she realized she was wrong.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.510
I know

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.640
you care about Chu Yu.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.030
But Jin is also your sister.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.790
Aren't you being too harsh?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.480
Mother,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.000
a son like me

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.960
shouldn't ask this.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.430
But Jian

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.510
has become

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.310
so reckless.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.200
Does it have nothing to do

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.640
with your indulgence?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.550
Mother.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.480
Linyang.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.510
I know I was wrong.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.920
Please let me out.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.310
Mother, please plead with him.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.310
Please help me.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.590
Linyang.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.000
I admit

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.750
I've spoiled Jin a little bit.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.510
But aren't you

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.960
being unfair?

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.950
Unfair?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.520
Mother.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.720
If you want fairness,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.110
do you think

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.270
kneeling all night in the hall

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.610
will make up

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.110
for what she did yesterday?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.070
An outsider set her sister up,

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.030
but she just stood by.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.510
She even encouraged it.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.040
In this matter,

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.790
even if Yu can let it go,

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.640
I will not.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.390
Chu Shan,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.310
take my mother back to her room.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.200
Linyang.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.480
Linyang.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.040
Kneel back there!

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.440
Linyang!

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.070
Linyang.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.240
I know I was wrong

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.960
in Young Master Sun's case.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.790
I shouldn't have followed him

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.070
to see my sister insulted.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.520
Oh, no.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.960
When he told me,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.110
I should have stopped him.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.080
Linyang,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.920
I know I was wrong.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.510
I won't do it again.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.830
Clearly, you don't know

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.680
what you did wrong.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.920
You're just saying

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.760
what I want to hear.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.350
Anyway,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.160
you just can't stand it

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.270
when my sister is aggrieved.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200
You think I was wrong.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.830
Then tell me

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.440
what wrong I've done.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.790
Is it because she didn't grow up

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.790
by Mother's side,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.270
so Mother loves me more?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.590
Or is it because

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.590
I didn't grow up

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.480
around you or Father

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.400
like she did,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.400
so, you care more

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.640
about her?

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.240
I just want you

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.550
to be fair to us.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.480
What is so wrong about that?

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.480
I'm talking to you

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.030
about what Yu suffered.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.640
What does it have to do

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.030
with your childhood?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.200
It has something to do.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.790
I just want my big brother

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.680
to care about me

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.590
and trust me like he trusts my sister.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.960
You keep saying

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.310
I don't know what she's suffered.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.350
But have you tried to understand me?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.000
Sometimes, I behaved deliberately.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.880
I provoked her on purpose.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.310
I just wanted you

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.440
to pay more attention to me.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.910
I admit.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.750
Between you and Yu,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.030
I care more about her.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.920
But that's because

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.350
we spent more time

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.000
in the northwest

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.720
and I knew her better.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.960
Glad you know you're biased.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.550
Since childhood, I've followed you.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.830
But what I always see

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.550
is that you and my sister

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.960
walk side by side ahead of me.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.720
You never notice me

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.590
unless I make a scene.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.840
Linyang,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.160
do you remember?

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.030
Every time you were back from battle,

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.830
you took my sister out

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.960
for fun.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.960
What you always gave me

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.350
was a mere doll.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.160
That's because

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.440
you were too young

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680
and Mother cared for you.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.590
She didn't want you to be as rebellious

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.680
as your sister.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.960
How do you know

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.440
I don't want to be like her?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.480
Because what I want

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.030
is never about the dolls.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.430
I want you

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.240
to stay around me

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.480
and care for me like you care for her

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.240
and treat me as an adult

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.400
instead of a kid

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.070
who only causes trouble.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.960
All you know

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.070
is that I keep bullying my sister.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.750
But you never know

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.400
I want to be her more than anyone else.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.440
In the past,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.440
I misunderstood you.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.350
Maybe

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.550
I didn't give you what you needed.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.510
But from this day on, I will change.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.840
What about you?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.000
Even if you felt

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.200
very aggrieved,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.640
you shouldn't have hurt her

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.480
that way.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.350
Yesterday,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.440
if the trap on Yu

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.400
really worked,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.510
how could you, as her sister,

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.240
remain innocent?

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.510
What horrible things about Yu

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.670
did you tell a man

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.790
like Young Master Sun

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.550
for him to be so determined

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.720
to please you

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.000
by ruining her reputation?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.560
Or perhaps,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.400
in his eyes,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.160
you have actually become

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.110
pretty malicious.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.190
Jin,

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.350
if Father

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.070
saw you like this,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.270
wouldn't it break his heart?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.800
I...

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.560
Linyang,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.680
when will you

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.550
truly acknowledge me?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.800
Not until

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.640
you truly grow up.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.270
Mother, do you care so much about her

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.550
that you must wait out here?

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.960
When you, your father,

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.680
and Yu

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.310
were guarding in the northwest,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.350
Jin stayed alone with me.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.510
When I missed you,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.400
she cheered me up.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.680
When our family declined,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.030
she tried every way to save money.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.720
Right now,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.830
is she doing everything

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.240
just for herself?

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.750
She is a naughty girl.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.440
But she isn't evil.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.920
So, she needs to know

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.960
what she can do

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.960
and what she can't do.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.200
Or she would go down the wrong path.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.760
Mother,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.680
we both are biased.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.590
I've got to know

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.640
Jin's feelings.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.590
I will try

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.560
to be nice to her.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.510
Will you also try

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.270
to be nice to Yu?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.440
When Yu was suffering,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.480
did you shed

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.510
even a single tear for her?

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.860
(Harmony Is Precious)

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.590
Take good care of yourselves at home.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.000
I've had your luggage loaded

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.920
on your carriages.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.200
If something is left behind,

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.270
pretend Yu and I

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.750
want you to come back often.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.960
But your children...

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.790
Are you sure they'll stay?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.680
The few of us

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.510
talked about that.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.310
When we're back home,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.790
we can't guarantee
their living conditions.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.320
But in this family,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.920
they have you.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.680
You will take care of them.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.760
When we manage

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.830
to live very well,

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.030
we'll come back for them, alright?

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.160
No problem.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.270
According to Yun,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.590
no matter where we are,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.110
we're part of this family.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.920
At yesterday's banquet,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:55.870
you said you wanted

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.350
to take away Brothers' spears.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.000
So, today,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.920
I'm not here to see you off,

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.030
but to give you them.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.920
You deserve the spears.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.760
Here, Han.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.720
Here, Jiu.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.800
Yun,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240
I should thank you

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.080
for either the paper

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.830
or the spear.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.000
Bring me my zither.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.520
Yes.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.000
My husband loved it

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.310
when I played some music.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.110
Especially the "Breaking-up" song.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.550
Right here,

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.590
I'll play it again.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.300
(True Might)

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.590
Her music

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.660
reminded me of the past

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.590
when Feng taught me

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.200
to use the spear.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.840
Han.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.550
Jiu is expressing gratitude

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.510
through some music.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.960
Let's not be outdone.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920
But I really wonder

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.960
if your martial arts

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.110
have regressed.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.150
Very well, Jue.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.830
Try me and you'll know.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.790
I often listened to such melodies.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.070
Every time I heard them,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.000
I felt as if all my efforts

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.840
would be meaningful.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.920
I wasn't as ambitious

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.830
as my brothers.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.200
In my opinion,

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.720
I wielded the spear

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.720
and fought in battles

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.680
just for my family members.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.590
I want them

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.480
to be always happy.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.350
But now, hearing that music,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.800
I think...

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.560
Think what?

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.110
All in all,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.160
I wasn't able to protect them.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.440
When I was little,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.030
my mother kept asking me

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.880
to behave like my sister.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.480
I should learn music,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.680
dance,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.030
and calligraphy.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.880
But I loved none of them.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.480
What I loved was martial arts.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.950
Look around.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.320
Here,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.160
nobody needs protection.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.520
Here.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.030
A little flower for you.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.190
Cheer up.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.260
(Letter of Release)

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.240
I will stay here

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.240
and guard Wei Rong.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:31.700
(True Might)

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.150
Mother.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.920
Are you leaving me alone?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.150
Mother,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.110
don't leave me.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.710
Good kid, Lingmo.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.160
One day,

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.760
Mother will come back and get you.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.990
All right?

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.940
(True Might)

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.240
Lingchun,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.880
your siblings aren't like you.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.110
Their parents are not here.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.320
You should take good care of them.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.680
Understand?

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.150
Yes, Mother.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.720
Auntie.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.620
(Knowledgeable and Optimistic)

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.070
Go get them.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.360
Have they left?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.110
I didn't know

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.110
you could be

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.480
so soft-hearted.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.340
I can't bear to see it

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360
when a mother has to

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.840
leave her children.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.360
So, I just avoided it.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.990
Tell me.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.960
Did we do the wrong thing?

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.840
Some of them

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.190
want to be free,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.880
but their children

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.400
may shackle them.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.600
Some of them want

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.480
to bring their children back home.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.920
But if they're asked to remarry,

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.230
how will a new husband

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.360
tolerate those children?

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.430
Even if someone

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.800
takes back her children,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.510
she isn't sure if she can

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.440
protect them very well.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.150
A normal man

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.400
respects some honorable people.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.440
A woman respects one more, her husband.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.510
Life is really hard

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.070
for women.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.200
So,

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.030
this family is good enough.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.110
Pretty good enough.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.880
They were set free at least.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.360
They had a second chance

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.800
to choose a life.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.200
Am I right?

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.390
You're right.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.630
Why is it you?

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.470
Look at me.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.760
Look at you?

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.710
Yes. You have to.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.710
Look at me and see

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.550
if there's something

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.070
on my face.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.500
Right here.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.400
No.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.290
No?

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.280
No.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.120
That's good, then.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.070
I think a mosquito bit me.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.320
It's itchy.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.120
Glad nothing's wrong.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.230
Ridiculous.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.640
Why are you here?

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.470
You... I...

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.070
Yun.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.480
Is it possible

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.720
that Xiaoqi is in your room?

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.140
I can't find it anywhere.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.330
Get in here and get it out.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.390
Alright.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.470
I...

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.640
Xiaoqi.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.150
Where are you?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.150
My lovely puppy.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.670
Where are you?

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.800
Xiaoqi.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.920
Xiaoqi, where are you?

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.030
Answer me.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.190
Xiaoqi.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.280
Have you found it?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.480
No. Your room is too big.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.880
It runs everywhere.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.720
Xiaoqi.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.030
Stop running, Xiaoqi.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.000
Does it run too fast

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.030
or can't you catch it?

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.920
That's easy for you to say.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.000
How about you try?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.840
I...

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.270
If you can't find it,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.000
don't waste your time.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.440
I can find it.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.600
Xiaoqi.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.200
Xiaoqi.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.670
Xiaoqi, behave.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.590
Xiaoqi, where are you?

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:29.950
Xiaoqi.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.550
Got you.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.120
Don't run away again.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.670
If you hadn't rushed me,

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.150
I would have found it earlier.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:13.800
You just made it harder.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.950
Xiaoqi, behave.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.280
You... Hurry.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.360
Take it out of my room.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.280
So, it's the Fish-shaped Tally
that you want.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.030
Chu Yu,

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.920
I'll have to give you a problem.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.660
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.110
What did I promise you?

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.150
I would invite you

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.110
to the Arsenal Bureau

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.280
when you became the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.150
Commander Lu, you're a man of your word.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.800
Very well.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.440
Your big brother set this rule.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.320
No drinking during the shift.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.880
So, drink some tea instead.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.480
Good tea, anyway.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.070
Not too bad for you.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.070
Commander Lu,

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.320
why did you invite me for tea?

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.800
Is this an apology for what happened

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.670
at Fragrance House?

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.150
Come on, Wei Yun.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.360
Has anyone ever told you

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.710
that for all your sharp wit,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.630
you can be

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.630
a bit annoying?

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.710
Must I apologize?

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.230
In this world,

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.760
don't be a stickler.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.590
You flatter me.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920
I drank the tea.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.150
And you apologized.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.550
Shall we get down to business?

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.280
I carefully studied

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.120
this mechanism.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.110
It wasn't made in the Arsenal Bureau.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.230
But it could not

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.630
have been manufactured

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.710
without our blueprints.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.320
That is to say,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.230
it indeed

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.280
came from my bureau.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.760
Wei Yun,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.280
do you know

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.880
why I didn't allow Wei Jun

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.360
or the army to use this

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.840
when I designed it?

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.800
My brother told me

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.670
it was defective

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.840
and harmful to both sides.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.030
That's right.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.510
At least one crossbowman

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.190
would be seriously injured

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.190
after every ten shots.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.280
Your big brother and I

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.230
never thought

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.840
it was a successful design.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.280
But the North Qi army

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.320
used it in battle first.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.360
It killed General Chu Jianchang,

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.760
injured General Chu Linyang,

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.670
and was also used in Baidi Valley.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:28.550
The North Qi army

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.070
would never find anything wrong

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.070
with this evil design.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.110
Yeah.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.070
So,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.840
someone in my bureau

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.680
betrayed us

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.880
and caused trouble.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.480
Now, you're the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.400
How about...?

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.590
I had a rough investigation

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.920
and I'm getting somewhere.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.430
Shall we cooperate?

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280
Commander Lu.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.120
Wei Yun,

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.230
