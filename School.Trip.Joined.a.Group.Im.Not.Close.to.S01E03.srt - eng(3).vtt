WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.960
Aww, he's so cute.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.160
So what's Hioki-kun to Watarai-kun?

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.560
Being asked that directly...

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.450
What does Watarai...

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.020
think is so great...

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.370
about me?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.290
Huh?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.040
Wait...

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.110
Where's Hioki?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.680
- Don't tell me he's lost.
- Mommy... Where's Mommy?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.950
Hioki.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.920
Mommy... Where's Mommy?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.740
Oh, look. Is that her over there?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.970
Well... where else might your mommy be?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.710
Try to think.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Oh... right.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.349
I have to contact the others.
Hold on a second, okay?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.250
No... Hold me.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.320
- Oh... Sorry, sorry...
- Hold me...

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.140
Sorry, let me just get my phone...

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.090
- No... No!
- Ahh! Sorry, sorry, sorry...

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.290
Okay... Okay, just calm down...

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.890
I have no choice.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.340
I'll have to take him
to the information desk.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
So, did you have fun today?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.500
I don't know.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.530
You don't know!

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.810
You don't know, huh?

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.410
There.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.270
No good.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.020
Still no answer.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.240
I checked the restrooms, too.
He's not there.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.770
I don't see him over here either.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.770
I'm gonna go look for him.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890
Call me if you find anything!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.700
(Episode 3)

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.670
Everyone's probably already gone back...

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.380
I hope I'm not causing
trouble for everyone...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.300
Okay, let me just get my phone...

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.220
- Got him.
- Ah... Sorry about that.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
Alright.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
Hioki...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where are you?

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.860
Mommy...

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.580
We're almost there.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.270
Yes, the restaurant is over there.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220
Enjoy your meal.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.570
Excuse me...

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.980
This child seems to be lost.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.040
He seems to have fallen asleep.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.780
Oh, you're right. I'll watch him for a bit.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.210
No!

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.660
Sorry, sorry.

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.560
- No!
- Hioki.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.030
Watarai!

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.650
What are you doing here?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.970
I couldn't get in touch with you, Hioki...

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.470
I was worried...

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.490
You came looking for me?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.380
I couldn't find you anywhere...

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.410
I thought maybe...

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.710
you'd be here.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.220
I'm sorry! I...!

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540
No...

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.480
I'm just glad you're okay.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.230
By the way,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.530
that kid...

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.140
He seems to be lost...

00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:25.047
But he starts crying
whenever I try to put him down.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.380
This...

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.160
That's so cool.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.130
- Mommy bought it for me.
- I see.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.280
- Your mommy is so nice.
- Yeah. Where's my mommy?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.790
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.716
Right now, your mommy is probably...

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.259
- looking all over for you.
- Really?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Yeah.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.740
So, come on.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.360
Here we go...

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.800
You're being so brave.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.950
Did you cry?

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.260
That's amazing...

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.660
Yu-kun!

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.060
Mommy!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.460
Thank goodness...

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.626
Don't run off like that again, okay?

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.650
Promise me?

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.380
I'm so sorry about all this...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600
Um...

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:31.670
I didn't tell you guys...

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.659
I told you, you don't have to apologize.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.660
But...

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.870
The fact that you were missing, Hioki,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.840
I didn't tell the teachers either.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.990
It's just that I...

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.360
was really worried.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.790
It's not a big deal.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.430
Even so, I still caused
trouble for everyone...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.970
It wasn't exactly trouble...

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.080
I was definitely freaking out, though.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.160
But as long as you're okay,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.730
that's all that matters.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.190
Why...

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.910
Huh?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.130
Why is Watarai...

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.810
so kind to me?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.810
Hioki?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.780
I'm too scared to ask.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.240
But I want to just come out and ask.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
Let's go.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.270
Yeah.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.790
Watarai... what do you...

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.200
like about me?

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.430
This time, really...

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.260
I'm so sorry, everyone.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.560
Hey, don't worry about it!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.390
Why are you apologizing anyway?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.070
Helping a lost kid is a good thing!

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.650
But...

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.920
If anything, it was perfect timing.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.400
We wanted to take a break anyway.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.500
Thank you.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.780
Besides, something fun happened.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.140
Huh? What?

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.690
Watarai was totally panicking.

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:21.191
Oh yeah, totally.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.790
- For real!
- He was on a whole other level of worried.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.500
- And then he just took off running!
- Yeah.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.390
Well, what was I supposed to do?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.160
- I was seriously worried!
- It was super...

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.610
- I'm sorry to you girls, too.
- Huh?

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320
Oh, no.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.860
It's fine with us...

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.230
Right?

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.020
Yeah, don't worry about it at all.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.290
However...

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.750
In exchange, you could
do something for us...

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.210
There's actually...

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.520
a place we want to go.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.400
(Cursed Hospital)

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.620
- Do you have the courage to face the truth?
- A ghost appeared.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.520
I see...

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.090
- Whoa!
- No, no, no.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.510
- Whoa!
- That looks so scary!

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.719
Well, I can probably guess...

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.370
why the girls wanted to come here.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.960
Hey, it's so scary! Guys, come with us!

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.450
Sure.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.200
But you girls have to lead the way.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.950
This guy never changes...

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680
But still,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.120
this atmosphere...

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680
is actually pretty scary, isn't it?

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Hey!

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.190
If it gets really scary,
can I hold on to you?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.760
- Absolutely not.
- Hey, you guys...

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.930
Hioki.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.010
Aren't you scared?

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.770
Huh? Me...?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.500
No, I'm not.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120
If you do get scared,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.370
do you want to hold hands?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.040
No... I'm okay.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.980
I see.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.080
Aah!

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.000
You've got to be kidding me.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.940
Ah! Wait... Hold on...!
No way...

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
Everyone...

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.380
Man... What is even happening?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.160
If I'd known it was this scary,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.990
I should've just... held Watarai's hand.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.990
Ah... Is that you, Watarai...?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.580
Watarai...

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.050
Asking someone to hold my hand...

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.730
is just too embarrassing.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.910
But you know...

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.580
Watarai's hand...

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.060
is so big.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.660
Hioki... Are you okay?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.030
Watarai... is in front of me?

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.430
Which means...

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.930
this hand is...

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.530
Aah!

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.450
Please come again.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.310
We've been waiting for you.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.180
- That was terrifying.
- Holding hands with a mummy...

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.290
- That's hilarious!
- Right? By the way...

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.910
I never knew Hioki could be so loud.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.930
Tell me about it! His scream...

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.730
- was the scariest part.
- I know, right?

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.590
Sorry.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.970
I should have been next to you.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.140
No, it's really okay...

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.190
I can't believe a mummy
stole you away, Hioki.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.870
What do you mean, 'stole away'?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.100
Besides, you guys were all...

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.410
scared to death, weren't you?

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.850
That's true.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.210
Hotta was about to cry.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.669
What?! I was not!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.970
- Yes, you were!
- Hey... guys... where to next?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We only have about 15 minutes left...
Is there anything you want to do last?

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.590
We only have 15 minutes left.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.730
Is there anything we
can all ride together now

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.670
without having to wait in line?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.620
Oh, hey, how about that?

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.510
The carousel.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.030
Whoa, what is this?

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.890
Ooh, I call this one!

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.090
- That one's so cute too.
- Which one are you picking? Have you decided?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.540
- I guess I'll take this one.
- Yep, this is the one for me.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.430
This makes me Napoleon!

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.076
- This one's so awesome.
- If you've picked one, just get on.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.856
- Isn't this one adorable? It is, right?
- Adorable.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.680
- Hey, yours is pretty cool.
- Cute, right? - So cute!

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.770
"The word impossible is not in my dictionary"

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.930
A carousel, huh?

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.630
Man, it's been a while.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.530
Hioki.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.660
Look over here.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.210
Huh?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.260
Oh.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200
It's a video.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.810
Wait!

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840
You should've told me.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.280
Oh, in that case...

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.690
I'll take one too.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.750
Okay, ready.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.750
With you filming me,

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.900
it feels kinda embarrassing.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.110
Why?

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.510
But you're so good-looking.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.540
How about I film you instead?

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.650
- No... you don't have to film me.
- I have to!

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.760
Why?

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.330
Because for me,
having you is all I need.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.540
Why?

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.240
What is it...

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.690
you...

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.030
like about me?

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.770
What is wrong with me?

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.820
Why did I say something so stupid?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.100
Oh, wait... what I meant was...

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.530
Let's see.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.430
I'm not really sure myself.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.660
Huh?

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.230
Looks like he didn't...

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.220
think much of it.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.840
You gotta take these one by one.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.720
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.500
Tsukasa.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.222
Tsukasa!

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.470
Help me with mine!

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.040
Do it yourself.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.790
Aren't you the oldest son?

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.809
- Yup.
- That's no way for the oldest to act.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.010
- Why not?
- Oh...

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.610
Talking about siblings, huh?

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.910
- What's that you're eating?
- I'm starting without you.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.310
- It's coffee-flavored. There's no way you can finish that.
- Yes, I can.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.440
- Digging in, meow.
- Meow.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.030
Ugh, I can't even watch.

00:15:40.485 --> 00:15:42.085
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.510
- Let's eat.
- It's good.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.816
Oh, by the way... Watarai,
do you have any siblings?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.350
Yeah, a younger brother.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.720
He's really cute.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.650
- He's only in first grade.
- First grade?

00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:52.996
So that means...

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.970
he's ten years younger than me.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.590
That explains it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Huh?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.930
Your hair

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.450
is a mess.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.790
That easy sense of closeness...

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.040
That kindness...

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.300
It's all because he's an older brother.
That's why he acts that way.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960
So that's it.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.430
So that's what this is about.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.220
Hey! What's your problem?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
Nothing.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.790
It's none of your business.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.910
What about you?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.419
Don't you have any?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.090
Siblings?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.830
Oh, yeah! Two older sisters.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.030
Oh...

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560
That explains it.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.870
Huh?

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.870
What?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.620
Nothing.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.700
It's nothing.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.420
None of your business.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.770
What's your deal?

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.476
Man, time is flying, isn't it?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500
The trip ends tomorrow.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.150
I know, right?

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.230
It feels like it went by
in the blink of an eye.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.740
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.640
The school trip.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.980
It ends tomorrow.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.800
But summer break is coming up.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.140
Right! We said we'd all
go to the beach this year.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.490
And do fireworks, too.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.330
It's kinda crazy...

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.760
I was so nervous at first.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.990
Oh.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.086
Hey, we should come back
to an amusement park again.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.110
Totally!

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.620
Let's all go again.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:12.500
Yeah, let's.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.070
Hioki, you'll have to get over
your fear of roller coasters first.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200
Huh... you think I can?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.120
And you have to try the
haunted house again.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:22.970
No... that's a hard pass.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960
Without realizing it,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.500
we've gotten to a point where we
can just look at each other and smile.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.306
There's no way I can
be satisfied with just this.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.800
Tomorrow, I have to...

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.380
- Okay, let's check in.
- I'm so excited.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.710
On the second day, we moved to a hotel...

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.880
Actually, there was a bit of a mix-up.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.619
I'm so sorry... about your rooms.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.700
There aren't enough beds. So... I'm
hoping you can all work something out.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.020
Mr. Kokufu.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:04.890
Yes, of course.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.290
Yes, no problem.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.530
Yes, it's fine.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.220
- No problem at all. We've got it covered.
- Miss...

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.820
- Not a problem.
- But...

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.890
Yes, of course.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.880
- How does this even happen?
- Seriously?

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.650
So, who's sharing with who?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.960
I toss and turn a lot, so I'm out.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.410
- Same here.
- What?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560
So...

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.690
How about it, should we
play rock-paper-scissors?

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.880
Actually, considering our heights,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.340
wouldn't it be too cramped
for Watarai and Hotta to share?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.640
Good point.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.850
With two people in that bed...

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.130
It'd be...

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:46.490
So...

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.340
Um...

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.566
Why don't the pairs who sat
together on the bus just share?

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.590
Huh?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.280
I mean, I'm...

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.580
I'm cool with it.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.949
He actually agreed.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.170
Oh, but it's up to Hioki.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.330
Huh? Oh, uh...

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.620
I... I'm okay with it.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920
Seriously?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120
You sure?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.100
Awesome!

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.310
Which bed?

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.890
I'll take this one.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.890
Aww, then I'll take that one.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.340
I'll take this bed.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.360
For real?

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.540
Well... here we go, I guess.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.420
Yeah.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.650
We decided that pretty quickly, but...

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:02.950
it feels like...

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.260
this is a lot closer than I thought.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.119
But we're both guys anyway,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.770
so it shouldn't be a big deal.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.880
You're gonna fall off
sleeping that close to the edge.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.860
Yeah.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900
You're... right.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.530
Even so, this is way too close, isn't it?

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.820
What is with him?

00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:37.301
Do all good-looking guys have a
weird sense of personal space?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.570
Ugh, seriously.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.920
I'm too nervous to sleep.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.360
Back then...

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.470
Watarai...

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.710
What do you...

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.730
like about me?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.860
I have no idea what the
right answer would have been.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:17.910
But...

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.900
by the way,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.910
why are you so protective of Hioki-kun?

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:27.910
Huh?

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.810
You guys weren't even
that close at the beginning.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.590
Watarai-kun.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.660
Hioki-kun...

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.110
What's so good about him anyway?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.510
Hmm... how should I put it?

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.510
Everything about him.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360
But for now,

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400
it's...

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160
Wh-what?

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.010
A secret.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.070
I'm not gonna

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.980
tell you that easily.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.020
Good night.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.050
Yeah.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.830
Good night.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.400
(Next Episode)
(It's the final day of the school trip.)

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.346
(My heart's racing seeing him in
that kimono...) Your hair is a mess.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.620
There. All better.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.643
(A new rival appears?!)
It really is you!

00:23:02.668 --> 00:23:03.668
You're here too?

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.900
What is this, some kind of hottie festival?

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.440
If you wouldn't mind...

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.360
would you like to... with me?
