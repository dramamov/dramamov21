(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.760
Hello. The number you have dialed
is not in service.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.680
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.399
Please check and dial again.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
Sorry.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.800
May I ask where Shen Meng is?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Excuse me, where is Shen Meng?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Who?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
- Shen Meng.
- I don't know.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
I don't know.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.520
Miss... Ms. Wang.

00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:46.800
It's me. I'm looking for Shen Meng.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.680
Shen Meng? Is she
an employee of our company?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.680
Or did she work here before?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
You don't know Shen Meng?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.760
I don't even know you.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Ms. Wang.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Don't joke with me.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.479
No, I...

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.519
I'm not joking.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
Our company really...

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:06.040
doesn't have an employee
named Shen Meng.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
If you...

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.920
If you don't believe me,
I'll have HR check for you.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
That's impossible.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
This isn't possible.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560
Zhao.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640
Something's wrong.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
Wait.

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.160
- I'm having a meeting.
- When I woke up,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.959
everything related
to Chen Jia Wen disappeared.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.200
Even Chen Jia Wen is gone.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Do you know where he is?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480
Who is Chen Jia Wen?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.720
You don't know who Chen Jia Wen is?

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840
Wait.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400
(Chen Jia Wen)

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.880
See? There's nothing here.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720
I don't know this person.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.800
Zhao insisted back then...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.279
that the places the terminator
passes through...

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.760
would achieve a delicate balance
with the sun's gravity,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.359
and the gateway
to a parallel universe...

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360
of a higher dimension would open.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.920
(Sunrise time)

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.760
(Sunrise time 5:58am)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.840
It's 5:58am.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
Let's end this...

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
where it started.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720
Let's put closure to this.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040
Chen Jia Wen.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
We've already broken up.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
Chen Jia Wen.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600
What are you doing?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.920
But we'll part ways sooner or later.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.760
We've already been apart
for four years.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
And what happened?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720
What if...

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.200
we can never get out of this day?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.520
Then we'll live
in the present day forever.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
Chen Jia Wen.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.440
You always say
that I don't care about you.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.319
You're just too unobservant.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.520
You didn't notice at all.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.200
Or do you just not believe...

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.160
that I can actually
face everything with you?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.919
I used to blame you
for not understanding me.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.080
But I realized I was the one
who didn't understand you.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.799
You've experienced
such painful things,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.320
and I had no idea at all.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040
In the future,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.520
are you still willing to be with me?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.360
As long as you're willing to say it,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720
it's never too late.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.640
(The End)

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.400
(Directed by Da Guang)

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.040
I had a dream just now.
