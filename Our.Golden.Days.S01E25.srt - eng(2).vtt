00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:05.046
(Episode 25)

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:19.786
You knew, didn't you?

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.326
You knew how I felt.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.266
I knew.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.816
And I knew, too.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.246
I knew what your answer would be. But still...

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.416
Even though I knew you'd reject me,

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:53.356
I just had to tell you.

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:56.856
Figures.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.866
You never say what you should at the right time,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.906
but you have no problem saying what you shouldn't.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.736
We're not...

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.276
a good match.

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:15.616
You...

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:18.116
don't suit me.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:24.456
- Back then... - But I heard that was your reason.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:28.826
He probably meant that he's the one who isn't good enough for you.

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:30.956
Not a guy like me who comes from a good family...

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:33.526
but has a difficult father.

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.936
Nor a guy like Ji Hyuk, too ordinary to be of any help to you.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.406
So Seong Jae told you.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:45.976
That's right.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.276
That's what I thought.

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:51.786
Because I cared about you so much.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.346
And if I meet a man like that...

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.056
I'm supposed to be happy?

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:04.626
Who are you to set my standards? It's my life, not yours.

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:08.666
I wanted you to be with someone perfect.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:11.966
If that's the case,

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.236
why didn't you tell me the reason back then?

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.936
When I was furious after hearing you were getting married.

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:20.346
If you'd just said, "Eun Oh, your background..."

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:21.416
"and circumstances..."

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:24.716
"don't meet my standards," it would've been so much simpler.

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:29.086
You let me completely misunderstand you,

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.986
and you never offered an explanation or even an excuse.

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:36.256
It was because of your ego,

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:39.096
your need to save face. Isn't that right?

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.096
Especially because you were about to become...

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:43.196
Haneul Construction's son-in-law.

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.236
In that moment, our ten years together...

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.776
and our friendship where we trusted each other more than anyone...

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.916
were shattered to pieces.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.886
I'm sorry.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.056
You're just pathetic.

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:09.556
What's the point of you liking me now?

00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:12.826
It's all pointless now.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.096
What do you mean, it's pointless?

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:21.036
If Jung Bo A hadn't run away from that wedding,

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:25.306
you'd be the son-in-law of the Haneul Construction family now.

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:30.946
I guess...

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.446
you'd be the Vice President.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:38.586
That kind of person...

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:40.286
I can't stand them.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:45.366
Someone who would marry without love for money...

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.196
I despise people like that.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.016
I would never let someone like that into my life.

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:16.096
We really...

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:20.496
don't belong together.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.436
Look.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:34.846
We're already a broken dish.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.346
They say you can glue a broken dish back together,

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:42.416
but you can never use it again.

00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:48.126
Since we're pieced back together in a way,

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:51.866
let's go back to how we were,

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:55.736
and just be good colleagues.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.116
Excuse me.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:12.746
Mr. Lee.

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:14.816
Why weren't you answering your phone?

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.586
The advisory firm has just sent over the AP Group valuation report.

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:21.726
Right.

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:25.066
Yes, I've printed it out for you, so please have a look.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.806
I need to go to Suri-dong and check on the facilities.

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.036
Okay.

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:55.756
It's over.

00:05:57.956 --> 00:05:58.966
It's all over now.

00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:21.586
Mr. Lee.

00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:28.456
Thanks.

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:08.026
Ji Hyuk said he wouldn't be coming home tonight.

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:09.866
I guess he's swamped.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.106
He's not coming home? What's he so busy with?

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.806
He just said he had to pull an all-nighter at work.

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:17.976
But he's not in manufacturing. Why would he pull an all-nighter?

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:21.746
You should've asked for more details on why he can't come home.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:26.916
The CEO wouldn't pull an all-nighter unless something happened.

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:29.316
That kid...

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:38.726
It looks like he went home.

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.306
- You're here? - You must have worked all night.

00:07:46.106 --> 00:07:47.606
Did you pull an all-nighter too?

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:49.276
The investment proposal was urgent.

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:52.246
Cheol Min, I'm going to the bank. Can you get the documents ready?

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:53.346
Yes, sir.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:58.616
I think we can approve the loan for the amount you requested.

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:00.586
Great. Please proceed.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:03.086
Be sure to emphasize that we must integrate our distribution,

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.886
logistics, and construction networks.

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:07.956
We absolutely must show them that the brand value will increase.

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:09.456
Next, with this graph...

00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:13.496
As you know, Mamdaerozip has shown consistent and rapid growth.

00:08:14.696 --> 00:08:17.366
The synergy between AP Group and Mamdaerozip...

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:19.636
is what you're about to witness.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.436
(Gogossing)

00:08:24.906 --> 00:08:26.306
Here's your delivery.

00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:29.816
How's that burn on your arm doing?

00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:31.946
It's getting better.

00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:33.286
Good.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:37.856
Mr. Shin met you at the restaurant. He said you're sharp and very nice.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:42.826
I'm new to this field, so please show me the ropes.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:46.866
Ms. Jung will show you the ropes before she goes on maternity leave.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:48.496
Okay.

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:53.036
So until she leaves, I just work four hours a day, right?

00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:58.746
(Finding a suitable delivery for Lee Sang Cheol)

00:09:02.446 --> 00:09:05.116
He just said he had to pull an all-nighter at work.

00:09:05.786 --> 00:09:07.686
But he's not in manufacturing. Why would he pull an all-nighter?

00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.056
(Mamdaerozip)

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.166
(AP Group Bidding War Kicks Off as Over Ten Companies Compete)

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:21.266
(Mamdaerozip 2.0)

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:24.096
(AP Group Bidding War Kicks Off as Over Ten Companies Compete)

00:09:24.166 --> 00:09:25.166
What?

00:09:25.506 --> 00:09:26.506
What in the world?

00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:28.036
This can't be happening.

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:29.906
This punk...

00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:32.976
(Ms. Shin)

00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:36.716
Ji Eun Oh's routine hasn't changed. She only goes between work and home.

00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:41.646
Whatever the reason, they still abandoned me.

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:45.086
What's there to be curious about?

00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:52.396
Of course, you must have a lot on your mind.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:00.866
Why do you keep staring at me?

00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:05.006
Didn't you say your business trip was supposed to be two weeks long?

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.746
I guess I must have missed you.

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:11.416
- Sorry? - I mean...

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:14.646
Didn't it occur to you that I might have cut my trip short?

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:19.256
How can you talk of marrying a guy you've only met once?

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:22.056
Do you even know what food he likes? Have you held his hand?

00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.256
Have you kissed him?

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:35.706
So, I say I missed you, and you get hiccups.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.276
This should stop them.

00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:40.946
He probably bought you a gift.

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:44.316
Then you say, "What's this for?"

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:45.786
What's this for?

00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:48.446
I was thinking of you during my trip.

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:50.616
Let me put it on for you.

00:10:51.086 --> 00:10:52.726
He'll say he bought it because he was thinking of you.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.056
- Then... - I'll accept it on my birthday.

00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:58.696
You have to really play up the "new to the dating scene" angle.

00:10:58.696 --> 00:11:00.766
You really haven't dated much, have you, Yeong Ra?

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:04.436
Please, sit down.

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:07.766
People are staring.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.046
Take it.

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.146
I'll get you something even better for your birthday.

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:24.416
Give this to me on my birthday, then.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.896
But you can't just act naive. You have to show a mind of your own.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:32.466
Receiving gifts for no reason...

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.266
It's not really my thing.

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:38.706
When is your birthday, then?

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.076
Are they parting ways immediately after the meal?

00:11:49.246 --> 00:11:50.516
Where are they off to?

00:11:55.586 --> 00:11:56.586
What?

00:11:58.486 --> 00:11:59.986
That punk is holding her hand.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:02.856
And Yeong Ra's just letting him?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.226
She lets her mom drag her around. Now, she lets a guy do it too.

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:08.936
Park Yeong Ra's life, I swear...

00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:10.436
Hey.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.666
How can you go through life not even knowing who you are?

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.406
For someone so talented at writing and drawing webtoons,

00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:19.076
why can't you use your own talents and live freely?

00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:31.656
What's wrong?

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:33.326
You must be feeling warm.

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:34.926
Your hand is a bit sweaty.

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:37.796
I guess I'm nervous.

00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.366
I thought I had some tissues.

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:46.306
I must have startled you by grabbing your hand like that.

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:53.106
We've only met twice.

00:12:54.176 --> 00:12:55.246
So of course, it's a little awkward.

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:57.316
But...

00:12:57.916 --> 00:13:00.546
I was under the impression we're dating with marriage in mind.

00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:02.986
Our families have already worked things out.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.926
It's not like we've set a date,

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:10.356
and this is still only our second meeting.

00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:13.226
So I'm not quite comfortable yet.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:17.996
Right.

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:19.736
That's what I like.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.136
I like that you're not like most girls these days.

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:24.206
Your mother has managed you very well.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.746
You said you had a meeting at 2pm, right?

00:13:36.256 --> 00:13:37.256
I'm cold.

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:44.226
Hey.

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:47.296
Hey, get her home safe. Got it?

00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:50.436
I hear that stalker is still on the loose, right?

00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:55.876
I'm a salaried employee. I don't accept tips.

00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:03.216
What's with him? The nerve.

00:14:03.546 --> 00:14:07.046
Wow, he has his surprisingly cool moments.

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:17.926
Darn it!

00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:33.506
What are you doing?

00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.216
Your hand is nice and dry.

00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:48.026
Lee Sang Hoon's hand was so clammy. It felt weird.

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:50.396
Weird, how?

00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:53.666
Good weird or bad weird?

00:14:54.726 --> 00:14:56.996
- Bad, obviously. - It was?

00:14:57.136 --> 00:15:01.606
Hey, that's a big deal. Physical chemistry is important.

00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:03.406
You at least know that much, right?

00:15:10.716 --> 00:15:14.046
You don't? You seriously don't know that?

00:15:14.116 --> 00:15:15.686
No, I know!

00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:17.856
Let me ask you straight out.

00:15:18.486 --> 00:15:21.326
First of all, do you actually want to get married now?

00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:25.666
I don't.

00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:28.796
Then just say no. Tell them he's not the one.

00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:32.506
Don't you know I can't be honest and just say I don't want to do it?

00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:35.806
You're always telling me, "Don't do it," or "You can't."

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:39.606
- Fine, get married then. - No, that's not what I meant.

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:44.776
I need to think.

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:47.246
About what?

00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:48.746
How to handle it.

00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:56.956
How was your date today?

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:59.866
I heard he even cut his business trip short to see you.

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:02.866
It was okay.

00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:04.936
It wasn't bad, was it?

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.006
No.

00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:11.376
And we're meeting again next week.

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:16.316
Good.

00:16:17.646 --> 00:16:18.846
Listen, Yeong Ra.

00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:21.686
If you marry into Jinhwa Group,

00:16:21.686 --> 00:16:24.516
you'll enter a top-20 business family.

00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:27.986
You know this opportunity doesn't come along for just anyone.

00:16:28.826 --> 00:16:33.266
If I'd had your advantages, I could've landed the HO Group heir.

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:35.226
I know.

00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:41.106
But since I was remarrying and had no family background,

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:43.306
I was more than grateful to marry your dad.

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:47.006
But it's different for you.

00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:51.076
In life, there's this thing called synergy.

00:16:52.016 --> 00:16:56.186
It's the combination of your family, looks, age, education, and job...

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.686
that made marrying the son of Jinhwa Group possible.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.886
And it's how you'll move up in the world.

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.496
Don't you forget it.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:10.036
Opportunities like this don't come often for people like us.

00:17:11.836 --> 00:17:13.866
Yes, I know.

00:17:26.616 --> 00:17:28.116
I know. I get it.

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:30.586
I know we agreed to pretend we don't know each other.

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:34.086
Then what are you doing in my room?

00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:39.166
Well, even so... I couldn't let this one thing slide.

00:17:40.466 --> 00:17:41.466
What's this about?

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:44.696
Are you that desperate for money?

00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:49.676
What makes you think you can just take over a huge company like AP?

00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:52.106
Why are you so desperate to hit the jackpot?

00:17:54.376 --> 00:17:56.746
How did you find out about that?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.346
Is that really what matters right now?

00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:02.146
I'm not trying to take it over for the money.

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:06.456
I'm not trying to hit the jackpot. So please, don't worry so much.

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:10.626
How can you not call it greed? A kid like you with no experience...

00:18:10.696 --> 00:18:12.966
thinking he can shoot straight to the top?

00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:14.366
Dad, please...

00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:17.666
Just stop...

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.206
Please, don't do this.

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:26.476
I'm asking you to stop judging me by your own standards.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.146
You could be wrong, you know.

00:18:30.446 --> 00:18:31.776
We had an agreement, Dad.

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.586
Just pretend you don't know anything.

00:18:38.356 --> 00:18:39.986
But you're my son...

00:18:40.056 --> 00:18:41.856
I know you're only worried because I'm your son.

00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:44.996
But you always jump straight to judging me.

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:48.626
And that doesn't help me at all.

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:27.136
Nice, we're off to a great start.

00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:30.606
And I've got even better news to top it off.

00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:33.706
The only good news I care about is an investment.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:38.516
Boyang Construction was on the list of strategic investors.

00:19:38.576 --> 00:19:41.386
- Yes. - They want to invest ten million.

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:44.456
Boyang Construction is offering ten million dollars?

00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:47.956
You heard the amount we're prepared to invest?

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:49.726
Ten million dollars.

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.296
Thank you.

00:19:51.796 --> 00:19:53.796
I've finally found a partner who believes in me.

00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:56.296
You've reviewed the investment terms, right?

00:19:59.306 --> 00:20:00.366
Are the terms acceptable?

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.136
Yes, there don't seem to be any particular issues.

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.776
In that case, shall we draw up the letter of intent now?

00:20:07.546 --> 00:20:08.746
That was a quick decision.

00:20:09.446 --> 00:20:12.376
- Please have the contract ready. - Sure.

00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:42.546
What brings you here?

00:20:44.976 --> 00:20:45.986
No reason.

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:49.716
Feel free to look around.

00:20:55.786 --> 00:20:57.556
Your clients must love this place.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:01.996
Why is he here?

00:21:03.636 --> 00:21:04.866
Here...

00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:07.936
Just in case.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:15.806
I'm leaving.

00:22:11.036 --> 00:22:12.096
This is good.

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:20.106

What if they didn't abandon you,

00:22:34.226 --> 00:22:35.826
but lost you instead?

00:22:36.096 --> 00:22:37.596
Even someone like me...

00:22:37.796 --> 00:22:40.296
I registered my DNA with the police, just in case.

00:22:55.076 --> 00:22:56.616
Please, don't do this.

00:22:57.176 --> 00:23:00.916
I'm asking you to stop judging me by your own standards.

00:23:01.316 --> 00:23:03.286
You could be wrong, you know.

00:23:03.656 --> 00:23:05.586
I wanted to live a good life.

00:23:06.256 --> 00:23:07.426
People in my generation...

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:10.926
don't believe they have to marry someone they love,

00:23:10.926 --> 00:23:13.326
and they don't see marriage as a necessity.

00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:15.566
It's just that our values are different.

00:23:15.626 --> 00:23:17.296
You're trapped in old-fashioned thinking.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:19.766
So you two will never understand my choice.

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:21.466
If you believe your life is right,

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.036
then just keep believing it.

00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:25.036
But don't force your children to agree with you.

00:23:25.036 --> 00:23:26.476
Dad, please...

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.306
"Please?"

00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:30.376
"Please?"

00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:34.686
I can't exactly take this to court. This is unbelievable.

00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:39.286
Let me know when you find another part-time job.

00:23:41.726 --> 00:23:43.156
(Mr. Early)

00:23:45.996 --> 00:23:47.296
Yes, it's me, the Spring.

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.596
Oh, my. You startled me.

00:23:50.466 --> 00:23:53.006
- Why? - You just picked up so fast.

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.436
- I was happy it was you. - Yes, it's nice to hear your voice.

00:23:57.706 --> 00:24:00.976
Anyway, it's nothing major. You asked me to let you know...

00:24:01.046 --> 00:24:02.276
if I found a new job.

00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:04.746
You found one? Where?

00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:08.516
It's over in Myeongsa-dong. It's right where I transfer buses...

00:24:08.586 --> 00:24:10.316
on my way home from the academy.

00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:13.486
Would it be okay if I head over there now?

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.126
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:24:16.196 --> 00:24:18.126
Really? Hey, me too.

00:24:18.196 --> 00:24:19.196
Yes, sure.

00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:24.896
Deciding on a dream in ninth grade is pretty early.

00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:26.906
That's not easy at that age.

00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:31.336
That's why I said, "Great. I'll send you abroad."

00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:34.576
We weren't rich,

00:24:34.576 --> 00:24:36.446
but I figured if I scrimped, saved every penny,

00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.146
and cashed in my severance pay,

00:24:38.776 --> 00:24:42.446
I thought I could scrape enough together to send him abroad.

00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:44.186
And then what happened?

00:24:45.056 --> 00:24:48.326
But then, around the spring of his senior year,

00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:52.126
my father's abdominal aorta ruptured,

00:24:52.196 --> 00:24:54.366
and he was also diagnosed with kidney cancer.

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:59.366
It wasn't just one surgery, either. In my father's condition,

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:02.366
he had to stay in the hospital for a very long time.

00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:07.646
So, I had to tell my son he couldn't study abroad.

00:25:09.816 --> 00:25:10.816
My gosh.

00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:12.916
But he was a high school senior?

00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:21.056
Well, as my father's son, it was my duty.

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:23.296
I felt like I had no other choice.

00:25:24.396 --> 00:25:25.826
So after that, my son...

00:25:25.896 --> 00:25:29.436
I thought he might at least go for architecture here in Korea,

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:32.136
but he just threw that dream away.

00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:37.806
He's a smart kid, though, so he aced school, got a good job,

00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:41.206
and I thought he was living his life freely enough, but...

00:25:42.576 --> 00:25:44.376
I guess that's not how he saw it.

00:25:44.946 --> 00:25:49.186
He resented me for my broken promise and let it build up over the years.

00:25:51.056 --> 00:25:53.186
Looking back on it now,

00:25:53.456 --> 00:25:57.956
I think giving up on architecture was his way of rebelling.

00:26:00.796 --> 00:26:02.266
I think I get it.

00:26:03.496 --> 00:26:05.266
So...

00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:10.706
What I want to ask is... I mean...

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:12.376
I'm...

00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:15.076
I'm not from my son's generation, you know?

00:26:16.276 --> 00:26:17.616
Please feel free to ask.

00:26:18.116 --> 00:26:20.146
You don't need to hold back with me.

00:26:21.186 --> 00:26:22.516
Well...

00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:27.626
For young adults these days, life is really tough, isn't it?

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:30.896
It's hard to find a job and even harder to get on your feet.

00:26:31.626 --> 00:26:34.896
Even though your generation is actually smarter than mine.

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:37.466
Right.

00:26:37.866 --> 00:26:40.906
Everyone's struggling and having a hard time.

00:26:42.366 --> 00:26:43.876
So for him,

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.046
I guess money has become the most important thing.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.446
He won't struggle just to get by, so he doesn't even want to marry.

00:26:52.076 --> 00:26:54.146
And... It's like...

00:26:55.686 --> 00:26:58.116
If a woman just checks all the right boxes,

00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:03.156
he can marry her without love. I guess that's what he believes.

00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:08.226
Your son?

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:10.936
But for me,

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:14.066
I can't wrap my head around that at all.

00:27:14.506 --> 00:27:16.806
But for young people these days,

00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:19.676
is that really a common way of thinking?

00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:24.546
It's very common.

00:27:27.516 --> 00:27:30.486
For our generation, it's hard without help from our parents.

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:32.416
No matter how hard we work,

00:27:33.186 --> 00:27:35.256
it's hard to buy a home...

00:27:35.456 --> 00:27:38.526
or build a decent life after getting married, you know?

00:27:39.196 --> 00:27:41.696
And on top of that, we're constantly being compared to others.

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:45.366
That's why everyone's on their own path.

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:47.836
Some people marry for love.

00:27:48.236 --> 00:27:50.676
Some settle for a marriage of convenience,

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:52.806
while some decide not to get married at all.

00:27:54.276 --> 00:27:57.476
And others even marry for money.

00:27:59.986 --> 00:28:04.486
And for your son, especially after his senior year,

00:28:04.886 --> 00:28:06.856
I can see why he thinks things like...

00:28:06.926 --> 00:28:10.156
his environment, background, and money are important.

00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:14.866
But you're not like that. You don't think like that.

00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:17.396
That's just me.

00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:25.276
So, without their parents' help, they'd think that way.

00:28:27.246 --> 00:28:28.846
It could really be like that?

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:39.116
Right. It's tough for the young. I get it.

00:28:39.956 --> 00:28:42.026
No, but even so, like that punk, Ji Hyuk,

00:28:42.086 --> 00:28:44.996
they'd marry a woman who can't get over another man?

00:28:45.126 --> 00:28:47.596
Good grief. No way.

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:53.736
There are young people like her who are doing just fine.

00:28:55.006 --> 00:28:56.006
But...

00:28:56.636 --> 00:29:00.906
how could she be so loved and cheerful if she were adopted?

I'm the son from the Hwauk branch. I'd like to propose a new menu item.

My mom's family has a secret recipe that's been passed down.

So then,

00:29:43.156 --> 00:29:45.886
are you sure the person who left you was your birth mother?

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:49.926
That I don't know.

What if I was just lost?

00:30:04.876 --> 00:30:08.206
Do you think my birth mother would still be looking for me?

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:11.346
Yes, of course. If you were lost,

00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:13.716
she'd still be looking for you, for sure. Don't be silly.

That's right, Grandma. Why don't you try it on?

00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:35.406
Me? Wear this?

00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:38.536
Honey, no. It won't fit me.

00:35:38.676 --> 00:35:41.606
Don't worry, Grandma. I'll make it fit.

00:35:41.676 --> 00:35:44.946
- This is no good! - Ha Eun, hand me some safety pins.

00:35:45.046 --> 00:35:46.276
Hey, that pricked me.

00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:49.546
Sorry, Grandma. We're almost there. Just a second.

00:35:49.616 --> 00:35:51.156
I told you it wouldn't fit. Honestly.

00:35:51.286 --> 00:35:53.426

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.666
It feels like just yesterday.

Grandma, you look so beautiful right now.

00:36:57.956 --> 00:36:59.386
I should've called first.

00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:01.086

00:37:11.466 --> 00:37:13.336

00:38:55.306 --> 00:38:56.936
Even when things are tough, you keep living.

00:38:57.576 --> 00:38:59.606
Even when it feels like you're dying,

00:38:59.606 --> 00:39:00.876
you somehow get through it.

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:02.606
But...

00:39:03.406 --> 00:39:05.116
at my age,

00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:07.386
nothing ever happens.

00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:09.986
So you just naturally start to feel down.

00:39:13.756 --> 00:39:17.156
But you still should have told me.

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:19.956
I'm your daughter, Dad.

00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:24.336
Why do everything by yourself? Going to the clinic alone.

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:28.206
Dad, why are you really being like this?

00:39:30.836 --> 00:39:32.606
There's nothing anyone can do.

00:39:33.106 --> 00:39:35.006
It's just my age. The years catching up.

00:39:35.946 --> 00:39:39.046
So you don't need to worry about me.

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:43.346
It's because I've lived too long with nothing to do.

00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:45.816
Dad.

00:39:49.756 --> 00:39:50.826
Dad.

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:52.996
I'm sorry.

00:39:53.556 --> 00:39:54.566
Dad...

00:40:10.276 --> 00:40:11.276
Thanks.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.646
You were really thorough with the special provisions.

00:40:18.186 --> 00:40:20.656
Hey, I actually heard an update from Sung Guk.

00:40:21.656 --> 00:40:22.656
With Boyang Construction.

00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.096
Honestly, I didn't think it would work out,

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.626
but you've already made it over the hump.

00:40:27.096 --> 00:40:28.096
We've still got a long way to go.

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:29.826
Hey, you're practically there.

00:40:30.666 --> 00:40:32.836
Honestly, I never imagined you'd get this far.

00:40:33.966 --> 00:40:34.966
That's incredible, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:40:39.606 --> 00:40:40.606
Thank you, and...

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.206
I'm sorry.

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:48.116
Okay, "thanks" for the investment.

00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:49.786
And what are you sorry for?

00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:54.786
I confessed my feelings to Eun Oh.

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.486
I couldn't wait for you.

00:41:04.036 --> 00:41:05.036
You got shot down, didn't you?

00:41:06.296 --> 00:41:07.306
Yes.

00:41:09.536 --> 00:41:12.436
So that's what it feels like when you can't hold back.

00:41:14.346 --> 00:41:16.946
You confessed even though you knew she'd turn you down?

00:41:19.576 --> 00:41:20.586
It just happened.

00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:28.226
But don't feel bad on my account.

00:41:30.256 --> 00:41:31.856
Because I'm not going to confess to Eun Oh.

00:41:33.156 --> 00:41:34.166
What?

00:41:35.266 --> 00:41:38.536
I've thought long and hard about why I even like Eun Oh.

00:41:39.966 --> 00:41:42.436
Hey, do you remember why we became friends?

00:41:44.776 --> 00:41:45.776
The sneakers?

00:41:46.736 --> 00:41:48.946
Hey, why are you bringing that up now?

00:41:49.276 --> 00:41:50.716
No, it's all related.

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.786
Now, you've got me curious.

00:41:54.016 --> 00:41:55.046
Go on.

00:41:55.716 --> 00:41:58.686
When they took my sneakers before, I'd just give them up.

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:00.486
Three times to the three of them.

00:42:01.086 --> 00:42:02.086
But...

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.426
I couldn't let them take my sneakers that day.

00:42:05.296 --> 00:42:06.926
Because my stepmother deliberately made me wear them.

00:42:09.166 --> 00:42:10.166
What's that supposed to mean?

00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:12.896
She wanted my father to find out...

00:42:13.766 --> 00:42:15.566
that I was being bullied.

00:42:16.306 --> 00:42:17.306
Wear these today.

00:42:17.676 --> 00:42:20.336
These are the limited-edition collaboration sneakers.

00:42:20.646 --> 00:42:22.006
Aren't they pretty?

00:42:23.246 --> 00:42:25.246
I like wearing these.

00:42:26.746 --> 00:42:28.516
I know your shoes got swapped by mistake,

00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:29.886
but you can't keep wearing those worn-out shoes.

00:42:31.086 --> 00:42:33.856
If your dad finds out, you'll be in big trouble.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.696
But these... They're too nice.

00:42:38.596 --> 00:42:41.966
It's a foreign brand kids don't know.

00:42:41.966 --> 00:42:43.566
They just look fancy.

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:49.566
I won't tell him...

00:42:49.836 --> 00:42:52.506
that you lost your shoes several times.

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:53.846
I'll keep it a secret.

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:56.876
Seriously, not these ones.

00:42:57.576 --> 00:42:59.576
- If they find out I lost these... - Then what?

00:43:00.116 --> 00:43:01.316
Are you going to call your mommy?

00:43:02.486 --> 00:43:03.616
I already gave you three pairs of sneakers.

00:43:04.256 --> 00:43:05.256
And they were all brand new.

00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:07.686
Please, just not this pair.

00:43:08.726 --> 00:43:10.556
I'll get you an extra 30 dollars from my allowance on Monday.

00:43:11.226 --> 00:43:12.926
- You punk. - No. Please, no!

00:43:13.326 --> 00:43:15.896
What do you mean, "no?" Come on!

00:43:16.826 --> 00:43:18.236
And that's when you saved me.

00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:21.506
You saved me from my stepmother's trap,

00:43:22.106 --> 00:43:25.076
and your parents showed me what a real loving family is.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:26.736
I was so envious.

00:43:27.946 --> 00:43:30.916
Wait. She deliberately tried to let your father know...

00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:32.646
that you were being bullied?

00:43:33.076 --> 00:43:34.086
But why?

00:43:35.016 --> 00:43:37.256
You know how my father hated me for being weak.

00:43:37.786 --> 00:43:39.986
If he'd found out his son was being bullied,

00:43:40.286 --> 00:43:42.456
he would've stormed into school and made a huge fuss.

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:44.426
Sure, the bullying might've stopped, but...

00:43:45.196 --> 00:43:47.226
my father would've become even more controlling and suffocating,

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:50.466
and I would have ended up on my stepmother's...

00:43:50.966 --> 00:43:51.966
invisible leash.

00:43:53.236 --> 00:43:54.236
That's right.

00:43:54.806 --> 00:43:57.506
You did say your stepmother was cold.

00:43:58.276 --> 00:43:59.376
But I had no idea it was that bad.

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:00.846
And you know what's terrifying?

00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:04.016
She smiles, but there's no warmth. It's chilling.

00:44:05.146 --> 00:44:06.276
And yet, she's perfect at everything.

00:44:07.486 --> 00:44:10.116
She even made someone like my father trust her completely.

00:44:13.686 --> 00:44:16.286
My whole life with my stepmother...

00:44:16.356 --> 00:44:18.296
has been like walking on eggshells.

00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:20.796
I can't let on that I hate her,

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:23.226
but I can't pretend to like her either.

00:44:24.096 --> 00:44:25.096
I'm scared she'll see through me.

00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:29.206
Man...

00:44:30.266 --> 00:44:31.736
It looks like you kept a lot from me, too.

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.506
I mean, you should have at least vented to me.

00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:36.946
But then I met Ji Eun Oh.

00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:40.786
From the moment I met her, I knew Eun Oh was different.

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:42.886
It was winter at the time,

00:44:43.586 --> 00:44:45.256
but she was so warm and comforting.

00:44:46.656 --> 00:44:47.786
So bright and full of life.

00:44:48.326 --> 00:44:49.326
She really was.

00:44:50.696 --> 00:44:51.696
That's just who she is.

00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:53.126
She really is.

00:44:54.726 --> 00:44:55.866
I was just in awe of her.

00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:58.966
I thought, "I want to love someone like that."

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:01.966
"I wish a woman like her could be mine."

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:04.176
But like you said,

00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:06.376
it'd be long-distance, so I couldn't say anything.

00:45:07.476 --> 00:45:10.376
And I figured I didn't deserve her, since I'm divorced.

00:45:11.276 --> 00:45:12.416
And more than anything,

00:45:13.116 --> 00:45:15.046
I was afraid she'd get dragged into my family's messy drama.

00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:17.956
I thought that's why I couldn't bring myself to confess.

00:45:23.686 --> 00:45:24.726
But it wasn't love.

00:45:26.296 --> 00:45:27.896
I managed to hold back, after all.

00:45:30.596 --> 00:45:31.696
Maybe...

00:45:33.096 --> 00:45:35.736
I think I just liked the idea of myself...

00:45:36.866 --> 00:45:37.876
being in love with someone.

00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:46.346
So?

00:45:46.846 --> 00:45:48.186
That's how I've sorted out my feelings.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:49.946
So what are you going to do?

00:45:51.986 --> 00:45:54.256
I can't think straight. It's too complicated.

00:45:54.986 --> 00:45:55.986
Why?

00:45:56.356 --> 00:45:57.496
You won't even talk to me about it?

00:45:58.596 --> 00:46:00.866
I only told you all this to clear up the misunderstanding.

00:46:03.426 --> 00:46:04.666
That's not the issue.

00:46:05.936 --> 00:46:06.936
I'm cornered.

00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:09.936
Then you'd better go all-in on the AP acquisition.

00:46:12.376 --> 00:46:15.276
At least I have that, I guess.

00:46:17.146 --> 00:46:18.676
Oh, right. The Preliminary Bid is tomorrow, isn't it?

00:46:19.416 --> 00:46:20.416
Just focus on your work.

00:46:20.716 --> 00:46:22.386
I'm saying this as your friend, not an investor.

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:25.656
All right.

00:46:26.256 --> 00:46:27.256
I'll be in touch.

00:46:29.026 --> 00:46:30.696
(Shoealls)

00:46:39.836 --> 00:46:40.836
I feel relieved.

00:46:43.106 --> 00:46:44.276
But it looks like Ji Hyuk's in real trouble.

00:46:50.846 --> 00:46:53.116
(Store Manager Choi In Sook)

00:46:54.016 --> 00:46:56.946
- Hello, Park Seong Jae speaking. - Director, what am I going to do?

00:46:57.346 --> 00:46:59.086
I really don't know what to do with Su Bin.

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:00.726
What's going on?

00:47:01.186 --> 00:47:02.756
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

00:47:02.826 --> 00:47:03.886
Have a good one!

00:47:11.566 --> 00:47:13.396
Su Bin. It's 6pm.

00:47:13.866 --> 00:47:16.736
Thank you so much for today. You were a great help with the rush.

00:47:19.206 --> 00:47:20.806
Is it that late already?

00:47:21.706 --> 00:47:24.216
We had so many customers, I lost all track of time.

00:47:25.746 --> 00:47:29.886
I was panicking about that huge tour group booking.

00:47:30.346 --> 00:47:33.056
It would've been a disaster if you weren't here.

00:47:33.486 --> 00:47:36.926
Min Ji, just let me know if you need help again.

00:47:38.626 --> 00:47:40.196
I learned so much from you.

00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:43.126
Thanks again for your help.

00:47:48.806 --> 00:47:49.806
Oh, this.

00:47:54.176 --> 00:47:56.206
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

00:48:04.816 --> 00:48:07.316
- Great work today. Good night. - You too. See you next time.

00:48:07.386 --> 00:48:09.256
- Great work. - You too.

00:48:14.396 --> 00:48:16.496
We submitted the Preliminary Bid today.

00:48:18.166 --> 00:48:19.696
Oh, you did?

00:48:20.596 --> 00:48:21.766
I really hope it goes well.

00:48:28.046 --> 00:48:29.606
Why is he giving me a report?

00:48:30.106 --> 00:48:31.446
Is he just clueless or what?

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:39.416
Hey, what's up?

00:48:40.686 --> 00:48:41.686
Eun Oh.

00:48:43.156 --> 00:48:44.256
There's something I need to tell you.

00:48:44.856 --> 00:48:45.856
What is it?

00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:50.066
Remember I said Ji Hyuk offered me a PR and marketing position?

00:48:51.766 --> 00:48:52.766
A recruitment offer.

00:48:53.036 --> 00:48:55.066
How about you run our company's PR and marketing?

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:58.736
You learned filming and editing to become a movie director, right?

00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.536
And you wouldn't have to come in every day.

00:49:01.176 --> 00:49:03.606
It's full-time with benefits, and you can work from home.

00:49:03.946 --> 00:49:04.946
Work from home?

00:49:05.146 --> 00:49:07.916
I wasn't expecting that. That's really tempting.

00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:13.316
But is that the only reason? I mean, this is so out of the blue.

00:49:14.186 --> 00:49:17.086
The company needs someone for PR and marketing.

00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:20.966
And I thought it'd be great for you and Eun Oh to work together.

00:49:22.496 --> 00:49:24.866
Since you two are so close.

00:49:26.266 --> 00:49:29.306
Are you really going to all this trouble for Eun Oh?

00:49:30.836 --> 00:49:32.276
What? What are you talking about?

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:35.076
Anyway, think it over and let me know later.

00:49:37.946 --> 00:49:39.046
That's when I knew.

00:49:39.816 --> 00:49:41.486
That Ji Hyuk likes you.

00:49:46.386 --> 00:49:47.386
I see.

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:52.026
Ji Eun Oh, I'm telling you, Ji Hyuk likes you.

00:49:55.496 --> 00:49:56.496
I know.

00:49:57.166 --> 00:49:58.166
How?

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.766
Did Ji Hyuk actually confess to you?

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.166
My gosh.

00:50:03.706 --> 00:50:06.906
How can you act like it's nothing? Now that he's told you he likes you.

00:50:08.876 --> 00:50:09.876
Su Jeong.

00:50:10.476 --> 00:50:11.916
You once told me...

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:16.516
that when you like someone, you get to know yourself better.

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:17.656
Yes.

00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:21.586
I've learned a lot too, after everything with Ji Hyuk.

00:50:22.056 --> 00:50:23.256
I've had a lot of realisations.

00:50:23.456 --> 00:50:24.656
Like what?

00:50:25.826 --> 00:50:27.496
That timing is everything.

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:30.166
That liking someone...

00:50:30.666 --> 00:50:33.336
isn't always some huge, dramatic thing.

00:50:34.196 --> 00:50:35.736
And even if it felt like a huge deal,

00:50:36.136 --> 00:50:38.436
things can change over time.

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:43.876
A crush doesn't mean it'll work out. And just because you like them,

00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:49.046
it doesn't mean they're the one. Stuff like that.

00:50:51.116 --> 00:50:53.056
So, what's your conclusion?

00:50:57.256 --> 00:50:58.896
From now on, Ji Hyuk and I...

00:50:59.496 --> 00:51:01.766
I want us to go back to being good friends like before.

00:51:03.726 --> 00:51:06.866
But really? You don't have any lingering feelings at all?

00:51:07.296 --> 00:51:08.736
I mean, you used to hate him.

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.876
But there's a thin line between love and hate.

00:51:14.236 --> 00:51:15.476
I don't hate him anymore.

00:51:16.046 --> 00:51:17.046
Not at all.

00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:21.386
It's so ironic, though.

00:51:22.016 --> 00:51:25.656
When we talked the other day, you sounded like you had some news,

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:28.526
so I wondered if something was up with you and Ji Hyuk.

00:51:31.196 --> 00:51:33.226
I did have something I wanted to talk to you about,

00:51:34.596 --> 00:51:35.596
but I've already made my decision.

00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:36.896
About what?

00:51:41.206 --> 00:51:42.806
(Guide to Requesting Disclosure of Adoption Information)

00:51:47.036 --> 00:51:49.006
(Ji Eun Oh has been confirmed as having no known relatives.)

00:51:51.646 --> 00:51:53.516
(Certificate of Genetic Testing for Adoptee with No Known Kin)

00:51:54.146 --> 00:51:57.756
So you have to take this to the police station?

00:51:59.856 --> 00:52:00.856
Yes.

00:52:06.996 --> 00:52:08.926
Su Bin, here's your hourly pay plus a bonus.

00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:11.096
No, it's okay.

00:52:11.536 --> 00:52:13.596
I wasn't expecting anything for helping out.

00:52:14.136 --> 00:52:18.406
You boosted sales so much, I can't just let it go unrewarded.

00:52:18.576 --> 00:52:19.576
Take it.

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.976
Wearing them is the best way to thank me.

00:52:22.346 --> 00:52:25.846
If you ever need an extra hand, feel free to give me a call.

00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:28.586
I'll get going.

00:52:28.986 --> 00:52:30.816
- You got this. - You too.

00:52:31.316 --> 00:52:32.316
Go on.

00:52:43.466 --> 00:52:44.466
Seong Jae.

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.206
(Shoealls)

00:53:00.146 --> 00:53:01.146
Seong Jae!

00:53:04.346 --> 00:53:07.656
- Seong Jae! - What?

00:53:08.656 --> 00:53:10.886
You scared me. Why are you yelling?

00:53:10.986 --> 00:53:12.756
You're the one making me yell!

00:53:14.226 --> 00:53:15.796
Why don't you ever listen to me?

00:53:16.666 --> 00:53:19.666
Why do you keep coming here? I thought you said you'd quit.

00:53:19.936 --> 00:53:22.306
I told you. I'm training Min Ji to take over.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.636
Why are you bothering with that?

00:53:25.136 --> 00:53:26.506
I told you to quit.

00:53:27.076 --> 00:53:28.506
Did you forget you fought with her?

00:53:28.876 --> 00:53:31.276
She formally apologised.

00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:34.886
How can you be so naive?

00:53:35.616 --> 00:53:36.786
And that's supposed to be an answer?

00:53:37.386 --> 00:53:39.016
You said you'd quit, but you keep showing up?

00:53:40.756 --> 00:53:44.086
It was a really busy day for the store,

00:53:44.226 --> 00:53:46.026
so I was planning on this being my last day.

00:53:46.196 --> 00:53:48.296
Exactly. Why is that your problem?

00:53:49.166 --> 00:53:50.266
Don't you have your own work to do?

00:53:51.096 --> 00:53:53.836
Your channel is doing great, and your subscribers have shot up.

00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:56.636
You have your own thing going on, so why do you keep coming here?

00:53:57.136 --> 00:53:58.736
Why are you making things so hard on yourself?

00:54:01.606 --> 00:54:02.606
That's what I'm wondering.

00:54:03.746 --> 00:54:04.746
What?

00:54:05.376 --> 00:54:07.746
Seriously, why haven't I quit this place?

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:12.016
- Why couldn't I quit? - Hey, listen.

00:54:12.986 --> 00:54:14.186
It must be because of you.

00:54:16.526 --> 00:54:17.526
What?

00:54:19.056 --> 00:54:20.056
I...

00:54:21.026 --> 00:54:22.296
I think I like you.

00:54:24.196 --> 00:54:25.196
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

00:54:25.196 --> 00:54:27.736
I thought I was just working hard because it's your company,

00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:29.866
but that's not it.

00:54:30.866 --> 00:54:33.836
When I'm here, you sometimes come by,

00:54:33.936 --> 00:54:35.206
and we get to talk.

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.516
I like you, Seong Jae.

00:54:56.096 --> 00:54:57.096
What is this?

00:54:57.896 --> 00:54:59.466
So, you've decided to pivot back to me now?

00:55:00.536 --> 00:55:02.236
Did I seem like an easier target than the weirdos...

00:55:02.236 --> 00:55:03.606
you met through the matchmaking agency?

00:55:04.136 --> 00:55:06.936
Is that why you dragged me out here? Just to pull this stunt?

00:55:07.076 --> 00:55:08.276
Are you done?

00:55:09.076 --> 00:55:10.346
You're divorced.

00:55:11.346 --> 00:55:15.446
My family is ordinary, so it's true I wanted a man with good prospects.

00:55:16.286 --> 00:55:17.416
But I told you...

00:55:18.086 --> 00:55:20.086
I wasn't just after money.

00:55:20.786 --> 00:55:22.626
A divorced guy wouldn't make the list.

00:55:22.626 --> 00:55:24.626
No matter how rich they are, divorced men...

00:55:24.726 --> 00:55:27.226
- are automatically out. - Exactly.

00:55:28.966 --> 00:55:30.296
So get a grip.

00:55:32.536 --> 00:55:33.936
I am divorced.

00:55:34.966 --> 00:55:37.766
I'm Ji Hyuk's friend, and you're his youngest sister,

00:55:37.836 --> 00:55:39.936
which makes you like a little sister to me, too.

00:55:41.546 --> 00:55:43.876
I don't care if your feelings are genuine or not.

00:55:45.416 --> 00:55:47.246
So if you ever say something so ridiculous again,

00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:50.416
I won't even see you as Ji Hyuk's sister anymore.

00:55:51.886 --> 00:55:53.016
So don't you ever...

00:55:58.456 --> 00:55:59.556
I'll take you home.

00:56:05.436 --> 00:56:06.466
Never mind.

00:56:08.466 --> 00:56:09.866
It's better she just leaves like that.

00:56:13.736 --> 00:56:15.046
You fool.

00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:18.416
She should be meeting a decent guy, not some...

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:34.866
That kid, saying such pointless things.

00:56:41.436 --> 00:56:43.566
Still, should I have at least made sure she ate?

00:56:48.006 --> 00:56:49.446
This is your fault, Lee Su Bin.

00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:55.286
- I'm home. - Su Bin, you haven't eaten, right?

00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:58.586
- I saved you a plate. - I'm not eating.

00:57:52.976 --> 00:57:54.006
Are you a burglar?

00:57:54.606 --> 00:57:57.876
I heard footsteps pacing outside and the doorknob rattling.

00:57:58.276 --> 00:57:59.376
Was that you?

00:58:00.146 --> 00:58:03.616
Yes, I just had some things to sort out in my head.

00:58:05.156 --> 00:58:07.286
- Why are you out here? Come on in. - Yes.

00:58:10.026 --> 00:58:11.726
Eun Oh, what's wrong?

00:58:13.526 --> 00:58:14.556
It's nothing.

00:58:15.226 --> 00:58:17.226
I was actually planning to wash my sneakers today.

00:58:17.596 --> 00:58:19.236
See, Mom? I'm psychic.

00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:23.566
Gang Oh washed your sneakers today. He even washed mine.

00:58:24.776 --> 00:58:25.976
You washed my sneakers?

00:58:27.506 --> 00:58:29.906
Hey, what's gotten into you?

00:58:30.476 --> 00:58:32.346
I learned a thing or two after I left home and struggled.

00:58:32.946 --> 00:58:36.146
You act all tough, but you have a soft spot for us.

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.616
You should've kicked me out ages ago.

00:58:39.386 --> 00:58:42.086
I was bad at school and didn't think to learn a trade.

00:58:42.156 --> 00:58:43.486
I was obsessed with getting rich quickly.

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.256
I started gambling online in high school.

00:58:45.556 --> 00:58:46.756
I just kept causing trouble.

00:58:48.996 --> 00:58:50.696
If I had gotten a reality check sooner,

00:58:51.026 --> 00:58:53.096
I wouldn't have said such horrible things to you.

00:58:54.336 --> 00:58:55.866
At the end of the day, it's just the three of us.

00:58:57.736 --> 00:58:58.736
Three?

00:59:01.506 --> 00:59:05.346
- Gang Oh, what's gotten into you? - She's right, Gang Oh.

00:59:05.616 --> 00:59:09.916
This new act makes you look even more suspicious. Knock it off.

00:59:10.946 --> 00:59:12.386
I know. Even I think I'm being weird.

00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:14.656
They say people who mature too fast are about to die.

00:59:16.856 --> 00:59:18.086
The things you say.

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.866
It all just clicked for me that day.

00:59:25.766 --> 00:59:28.636
When those guys were treating me like dirt at the bar,

00:59:28.636 --> 00:59:30.366
you just appeared and saved me.

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.846
I realised the only ones on my side are family.

00:59:52.226 --> 00:59:53.226
Delivery!

00:59:57.096 --> 00:59:59.166
Yeong Ra, stay put.

01:00:00.236 --> 01:00:01.706
No, it's a real delivery.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:04.466
I got a text that a package arrived.

01:00:09.146 --> 01:00:10.176
What is this?

01:00:10.846 --> 01:00:11.846
Listen.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.746
You know my mom put a GPS tracker on my car, right?

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:16.946
There's one on your phone, too.

01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:20.786
Can you put this tracker on my mom's car for me?

01:00:21.626 --> 01:00:22.626
What?

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:24.286
On Director Ko's car?

01:00:24.896 --> 01:00:25.896
Yes.

01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:29.596
First, I need to figure out where she's going.

01:00:30.926 --> 01:00:32.136
How are you feeling?

01:00:32.736 --> 01:00:34.736
Don't just lie there. Try to move around a little.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:38.776
- You need strength for the surgery. - I know. I took a walk and...

01:00:41.476 --> 01:00:43.976
I'm sitting down now. I got a little tired.

01:00:44.446 --> 01:00:45.446
Are you outside?

01:00:46.216 --> 01:00:47.416
So you did go for a walk.

01:00:47.676 --> 01:00:51.116
I said to get some air by the door. Get back inside.

01:00:51.186 --> 01:00:54.156
Seriously, what if you catch a cold? What would you do?

01:00:54.616 --> 01:00:55.756
Okay, I get it.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.956
I'll see you at your next hospital appointment.

01:01:01.226 --> 01:01:02.266
Mom.

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:05.366
I told you not to worry. How many times must you ask?

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.006
I'll tell you more at your checkup.

01:01:11.166 --> 01:01:13.836
(Certificate of Genetic Testing for Adoptee with No Known Kin)

01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:17.106
At the end of the day, it's just the three of us.

01:01:19.446 --> 01:01:20.676
It all just clicked for me that day.

01:01:22.316 --> 01:01:24.546
I realised the only ones on my side are family.

01:01:28.586 --> 01:01:29.586
Yes.

01:01:33.296 --> 01:01:34.656
What's up?

Ji Eun Oh.

01:01:37.196 --> 01:01:38.436
Get a DNA test.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.766
You have to do it for your own sake.

01:01:42.736 --> 01:01:45.406
It's not for your birth parents, whoever they may be,

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:46.906
but for yourself, so this doesn't...

01:01:47.406 --> 01:01:48.846
keep eating away at you.

01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:54.846
- I'll decide what to do. - I know you don't want me meddling,

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:57.016
but I've already been through this,

01:01:57.446 --> 01:01:58.456
so let me just say this.

01:01:59.356 --> 01:02:00.786
If you don't go through with the DNA registration,

01:02:01.626 --> 01:02:03.286
you'll spend your life wondering if...

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.526
your birth mom is looking for you.

01:02:05.196 --> 01:02:06.356
It'll be agonizing.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.566
But let's say you register your DNA.

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:10.766
If you end up finding your birth parents,

01:02:11.266 --> 01:02:13.536
you'll be able to end their suffering.

01:02:14.466 --> 01:02:15.506
But...

01:02:15.936 --> 01:02:18.636
- if no match comes up... - Then it means I was abandoned.

01:02:18.976 --> 01:02:20.176
Even if that's true,

01:02:21.036 --> 01:02:22.446
that doesn't have to define your life.

01:02:24.206 --> 01:02:25.216
You already have...

01:02:26.116 --> 01:02:27.346
parents.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:30.546
So this is...

01:02:31.086 --> 01:02:32.516
something you need to do for yourself.

01:02:33.886 --> 01:02:34.886
End of story.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.466
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

01:02:50.936 --> 01:02:53.576

(Civil Complaint Counselling)

01:03:04.286 --> 01:03:05.516
How can I help you?

01:03:06.786 --> 01:03:09.326
I'm here for the Family Search DNA Registration.

01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:12.796
You've filled out the consent form, but I just need to double-check.

01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:17.796
Do you consent to the sample collection?

01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:19.666
Yes.

01:03:50.366 --> 01:03:52.736
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:52.936 --> 01:03:56.336
Am I supposed to marry just anyone if they're from a family like ours?

01:03:56.406 --> 01:03:58.606
And because Mother arranged it, does that make her a decent person?

01:03:58.676 --> 01:04:01.136
Just go on 3 dates with me. Please? Just 3.

01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:03.806
That's all it takes to see if there's something between us.

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:06.246
Eun Oh, Gang Oh's in trouble.

01:04:06.246 --> 01:04:07.976
I shouldn't have registered my DNA.

01:04:08.046 --> 01:04:11.856
- What if the acquisition fails? - The company could take a big hit.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:13.886
- Dad! - What is it?

01:04:13.956 --> 01:04:17.886
I heard his acquisition failed! Ji Hyuk's company went bankrupt!

01:04:17.956 --> 01:04:18.956
What did you say?
