=Episode 12=

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.030
My Lady, have some tea.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.840
You've been at it all day and night.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.640
Father's been trading
across the land for years.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.880
I'm trying to look for clues

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.790
from the people he worked with.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.750
Xu Wanning,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.960
while your father's in trouble,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.150
you're here counting coins?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.200
Are you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.110
trying to divide the family assets?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
I am saving my father.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.150
Master!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870
You just left home yesterday,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.840
and this house has no place for me now.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.280
Perhaps I should go with you.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.950
I'd rather die!

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.510
Nanny Liu, how dare you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.400
make a scene here?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.710
Madam,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.430
had I any other choice,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.230
why would I do this?

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.400
Lady Xu is kicking me out

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.120
without any explanation.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120
Nanny,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
you've served this family for ages.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.310
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.040
Don't be so dramatic.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.040
You said Lady Xu is kicking you out?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.200
Why exactly would she do that?

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.040
Let's all hear what it is.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.230
Madam,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.280
all because of some casual comments.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.710
Casual comments?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.640
I called her

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.870
a jinx

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.710
and a walking curse.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360
When she was with the Marquis,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.150
the Cui family

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360
was eventually confiscated.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.000
And she'd just returned home,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.080
Master suddenly got into trouble.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.630
I had my doubts,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.280
so I grumbled a few words.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.280
Who knew she'd hear me

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.190
and drive me out?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.240
Lady Xu, I confess my mistake.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.360
Please forgive me

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.030
and let me off this time.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.430
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.870
I'm so sorry.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.360
She's so vicious-minded.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.240
Nanny Liu has served for years,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.750
yet she gets treated so harshly.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.080
Exactly.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.540
Only Madam has a kind, merciful heart.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960
She defends and shows pity to her servants.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.560
Were it some other family,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.800
a divorced daughter like her
would've been cast out.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.360
Indeed. She should be cast out.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.960
Throw her out.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.430
Shut your mouths.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.430
My Lady is not as you say.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.430
Nanny Liu,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.360
do you think I'm driving you away

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.590
because I'm angry about your gossip?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.190
If Nanny Liu wants to know the reason, fine.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.400
The affairs within are not my responsibility,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.840
but I did find something by accident.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.190
Nanny, don't you want to know the reason?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.430
Very well, I'll tell you.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.430
Nanny, you've served here many years

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.280
and you can read a ledger, right?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.910
Managing this household

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.870
surely demands diligence.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.560
But some turn that vigilance

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.310
toward greed,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.240
taking advantage.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.240
Nanny, the ledger lists every bit

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240
of profit you've stolen

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.470
all these years.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.590
Down to the last coin.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.750
I...

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.310
For the sake of your long loyalty,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.120
I didn't pursue past matters.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.590
Out of compassion for your old age,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.870
I offered you money
to retire to your hometown.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.240
I'd say I've been more than fair.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.960
I admit my guilt.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.800
I'm sorry.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.000
Since that's settled,
let me make it clear today.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.680
I may not run the household,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.590
but I'm the legitimate eldest daughter.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.430
It's time I shoulder the family's concerns

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.190
and ease Auntie's worries,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.110
right?

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.070
I believe Auntie will

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.240
never wrong the deserving,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.560
nor spare the guilty.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.920
Let's be objective

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.090
with clear rewards and punishments.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.800
What do you say, Auntie?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.080
All right.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.560
Who is in charge here?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.430
Get out here now!

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.880
What is it?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360
Master Xu has been arrested.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.240
We are canceling our order for the goods.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.680
Give us our money back now.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.950
Give us a refund, now.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.120
If nobody steps forward,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.160
I'll wreck everything here.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.310
I'd like to see you try.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.750
You want a refund, right?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.950
Bring out the contract.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.430
Contract?

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.350
Correct.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.720
Who are you?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.390
Weren't you looking
for whoever's in charge?

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.040
According to the commercial laws,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.070
a contract must be signed
to establish dealings

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.040
between buyer and seller.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.040
Both sides hold a copy of the contract.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.750
If a dispute arises,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.270
the contract shall prevail.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.070
Since you want a refund,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.360
bring out the contract.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.950
If the contract permits,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.160
we'll refund as required.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.430
Can you make that call?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.520
I can.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.000
Xu Wanning,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.110
you...

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.120
Unless we're at fault,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.000
there will be no refund.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.640
Gentlemen,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.360
we've been in business here

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.630
for many years.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.270
I'm sure after years of cooperation,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.680
you're familiar with our commercial ethics

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.520
and my father's integrity.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.030
Mm.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.190
At present,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.190
my father

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.240
languishes in custody,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.190
yet I trust truth will clear his name.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.750
One day he will return safely.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.430
But before that,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.270
I want to continue fulfilling the contract

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.070
and preserve the business
we've built for generations.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.270
If you trust me,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.430
please give me some time.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.390
If you don't,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.750
let's terminate the contract

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.830
strictly by the rules.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.390
I'll vouch for Wanning.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.870
I will bear

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.430
all consequences together with her.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.310
Lady Xu's words just now

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.190
have deeply impressed us.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.830
We dare not trouble Her Highness.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.600
We agree to continue
fulfilling the deal with Lady Xu.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.680
Many thanks, gentlemen.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.750
Auntie, be careful.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.240
Princess, thank you for your help.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.590
Princess, please sit.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.750
Don't mention it.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.390
You did it all by yourself.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.920
I really didn't expect it

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.190
I never thought

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.990
you'd change so drastically after six years.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.070
I haven't changed much,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.070
but the vicissitudes of life

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.950
force one to adapt.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.360
I've come today

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.070
to invite you to my birthday banquet.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.070
Birthday banquet?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.200
Mm.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.630
I've heard about your father's case.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.750
I want you to attend

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.240
because there will be

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040
many officials and nobles there,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.680
and perhaps they might have some clues

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.000
that could help you.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.600
I appreciate your consideration.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.360
It's just that many years ago,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.170
I already ruined your poetry gathering.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.950
If I attend

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.190
to investigate,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.040
I'm afraid I might cause you trouble.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.070
It'll be fine, Wanning.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.830
Go without worry.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.240
Leave the rest to me.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.640
Thank you, Princess.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.870
Isn't this the capital's

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.800
most calculating social climber?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.160
Why does she turn up
wherever there's aristocracy?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.480
Exactly.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.310
She's a walking curse.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.000
Let's all stay away from her.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.960
She jinxed her husband and her father.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.630
I heard both of them are in prison now.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.670
Just look at her attire.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.630
I mistook her for a maid

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.360
who'd strayed where she shouldn't.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.030
And she even dared to divorce her husband.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.910
Truly ridiculous.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.480
She looks just like a needy puppy,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.240
always following behind the Princess.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.750
That merchant's daughter

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.960
doesn't know her place.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.480
Obviously, it's like

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.750
a toad entered a circle it shouldn't have.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.960
So embarrassing.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.960
Embarrassment isn't the worst.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.670
What's scary is being kicked out one day.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.600
You must be thirsty.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.790
I'll go make some tea for you.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.040
Wanning.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.320
Make it quick.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.730
Commander,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.750
Princess Anle invites you
to her birthday banquet.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.200
The banquet will start soon.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.030
If you don't set off now, you'll be late.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.550
Boring.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.000
It's a waste of my time.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.360
What if I told you
Lady Xu will also be there?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.750
Get my horse ready.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.920
Right away.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.150
Welcome to attend
my daughter's birthday banquet.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.150
Everyone, please feel at ease.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.270
Let's celebrate

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.750
and enjoy ourselves.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.540
(Violet Reverie)

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.630
Moonlight crowns the boundless sea.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.960
Pearls are born of the mermaid's tears.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.120
This pearl is from the East Sea.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.390
Such a radiant treasure

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.360
is worthy only of the Princess.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.840
I wish the Princess eternal radiance,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.550
glowing like celestial lights.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.910
Much appreciated.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.480
This jade is from the Kunlun Mountains.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.600
A fine craftsman spent a year engraving it.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.840
I wish Your Highness happiness, peace,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.680
and good luck.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.840
Thank you.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.750
Has the social climber

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.440
come empty‑handed,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.870
planning to slip away?

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.510
Don't be rude.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.720
Wanning is my guest.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.600
Her presence alone brings me joy.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.870
Nothing else matters.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.080
Princess, you may not care,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.150
but she is far too lacking in manners.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.670
Exactly.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.550
Common blood, common manners.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.870
How disgraceful.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.000
Who says I don't have a gift?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.110
Hongmei.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.150
Your gifts are truly precious.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.120
Though my offering is more accessible,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.150
the ingredients within the sachet

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.910
were handpicked and mixed with care.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.750
It helps with sleep,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960
enhances appetite,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.750
and with long-term use,
it has cosmetic benefits.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.750
Lately, my sleep has been troubled,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.750
and I've been searching for a cure.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.030
Wanning's gift is the perfect remedy.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.960
I am very fond of it.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.270
Since it is so effective,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.600
why not share it with all the girls here?

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.840
It'd honor Wanning's thoughtful heart.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.630
How dare you bring such shabby items

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.200
to offend the Princess?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.030
With all the physicians out there,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.720
you come here
to show off your petty skill.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.910
How amusingly bold.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.320
I heard your father

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.480
was imprisoned for selling

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.240
forbidden medicines.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.910
Could it contain that as well?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.390
The materials in this sachet are ordinary,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.480
but nothing illegal.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.440
If you don't like it,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440
I'll just take it back.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.510
Are you expecting us to believe it?

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.150
We'll have to examine them ourselves.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.670
Xu Wanning, you are a mother now.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.910
Better stay home and nurse your child

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.440
instead of clinging to the powerful.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.840
Don't you realize

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.910
your reputation's in tatters now?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.390
Soon your son's honor

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.320
will rot with yours if you keep this up.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.000
Lady Wang,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.030
you inherited none

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.320
of your father's scholarly wisdom,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.150
but you perfected the skills
of a street gossip,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.080
spouting nonsense all day.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.000
Your tongue

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.790
must be as long as your girdle by now.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.960
Although you are a legitimate daughter,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.240
you are not favored by your father.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.870
You're nothing but a gossiping fool.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.360
I advise you

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.150
to go back and read more books.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.960
How about greasing up your tongue?

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.630
Otherwise, when it gets all tangled up later,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.790
you'll be even more detested.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.790
Lady Li,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.030
so you found your tongue today.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.630
I heard you're

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.290
a timid mute at home,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.360
always bowing and cringing.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.480
You even conspired to send your mother
to an early grave.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.240
Well, that figures.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.360
You have to flatter others hard.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.200
Otherwise, how could
a daughter of a concubine

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.720
mingle with the noble ladies?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.200
Oddly enough,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.630
you're the one I can stand.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.910
They're born to gold and rank,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.270
and you're the capital's exemplar.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.720
But from what I saw today,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.240
this so-called exemplar is

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.390
nothing but a petty, ignorant gossip

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.600
who's blind as a mole.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.910
Now I see why Wang ended the betrothal.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.750
His decision makes perfect sense.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.150
(As expected.)

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.840
(This is the Xu Wanning I know.)

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.000
All of you are

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.080
(Violet Reverie)
putting on airs of virtue and propriety.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.480
But inside you're small‑minded

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.320
and vain beyond reason.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.270
Where does your arrogance come from?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.390
How dare you?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.200
Xu Wanning,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.030
you're just from a merchant family.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.120
How dare you insult us?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.560
I'll have my father

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.440
throw you in prison

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.720
and wipe out your entire family.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.120
Listen to that arrogance.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.030
Then let's see how you do it.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.240
I don't believe justice

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.550
has vanished in broad daylight.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.990
Justice, you say?

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.080
Of course, justice stands.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.600
I am Ma Chenggong,
Prefect of the Capital City.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.440
It's my duty to correct injustice.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.480
Today,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.480
Xu Wanning will learn her lesson

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.320
about what justice truly means.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.600
Xu Wanning disrupts

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.440
the royal feast with her chaos.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.080
Guards.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.870
Throw her into prison.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.270
She shall be tried another day.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.840
Hold on.
